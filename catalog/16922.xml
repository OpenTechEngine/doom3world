<br/><br/>
Here's why I came up with this... I have a hollow cylinder that I want to make rotate. Obviously though, since it's hollow, the cylinder is made of multiple brushes. I could go through the painstaking process of linking the script to all of them and having them rotate individually, but I wondered if perhaps there was a way of turning this set of brushes into an entity and rotating it that way instead. Or perhaps there's a way to permanantly group a set of brushes together?&#13;

Is this possible?</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>
