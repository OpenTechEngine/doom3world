I do have several UV maps, mostly mess-ups because I didn't weld certain points together (example - the curved corners of the table were not originally welded to the whole table, so when the UV map was generated, the corners were separate. I wanted both the top and bottom faces of the table to be whole squares with filleted corners in the UV map, so I welded the points, and that worked). I assumed the UV maps that had textures applied were the only ones that were used ingame.<br /><br />Thanks.
