I got it to display the way I wanted it to in the editor.
<br /><br />I did this:
<br /><br />1.Create a plane and turned it around to face my camrea to make a skybox for this desert land I am making. extrude it's edge to the other side of my land.
<br /><br />2.Selected all the edges on the plane of my skybox.
<br /><br />3.Make them a seam.
<br /><br />4.Select the object and put a texture on it that is a sky.
<br /><br />5.Go into the UV face editor and have my sky box selected and pressed "U".
<br /><br />6.Goto project from view 2
<br /><br />7. made a new screen in Blender called UV mapper and picked my sky texture and moved the UV's around but when I go into render mode the UV's arn't placed correctly. 
<br /><br /><br />How do I fix this? Thank you.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p165152" date="Posted: Wed Dec 20, 2006 3:23 pm "><author>Goofos</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">You have to choose "UV" instead of "Orco" in map input of your texture.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p165167" date="Posted: Thu Dec 21, 2006 3:09 am "><author>ajm113</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I can't find it.

<br /><br />Sweet It Works! Now I can make my Harvy Birdman Lucky Mug Avatar!
<br /><br />Thanks, man!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081204022553im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p166146" date="Posted: Mon Jan 01, 2007 11:34 am "><author>kit89</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">The way Goofos was telling you was correct and gives far more flexability with your texture, like bump maps etc.
<br /><br />To set it up that way, you must give your model a material once that is done go into the texture section and create a new texture. In the drop down menu of the new texture select "Image" and new window should appear. Click on the "Load Image" and select your uv-map. 
<br /><br />Now Deselect the TexFace Button. And follow what Goofos said. It should work that way as well.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p165030" date="Posted: Mon Dec 18, 2006 8:07 pm "><author>ajm113</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Blender's rendering system is not showing my UV mapped object correctly in render mode.
