I'm currently a Game Design student at UAT and the Project lead on the Zero Barrier Project.  For the life of me I cannot understand why things are not working.&#13;<br /><br />At first with the (console) exportmodels command I received the standard "Cannot find source file" message.  I've tried this with Maya 5 and Maya 7.  Not only with my character but with a standard box/bone setup to keep things simple.  Now Whenever I try to export the mesh it simply hangs there and gives me no indication one way or another what it is doing.  It doesn't give me an error, nor does it preceed to look like its executing that command.  I'm really not sure why.  I've frozen all the transformations before binding, I have an origin bone, deleted history (not neccesarily in that order) and I have a standard texture unwrapped on the model with a simplistic .def and mtr. file.&#13;<br /><br />I've noticed that the mayaexport.dll says 1.4.1 with the beta update for Quake IV.  I was wondering if that was an update to enable use for Maya 7 or not.  If not I've also tried the Doom3 Maya 7 dll from facinghell.com.  &#13;<br /><br />When all of that failed I finally found a Maya exporter for MD5's which looks like it works, but it is giving me a shader error message when trying to execute this MEL script for my model.  I aquired the MEL script after a ton of searching through <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.zbufferstudios.com/" class="postlink">http://www.zbufferstudios.com</a>.  Has anyone had anyluck with his MEL script or does anyone have any thoughts as to why the export command is just hanging there?  I can post my def file if those of you would like. &#13;<br /><br />On a last note I've almost wondered if the export process is a slight bit different for Quake than it is for Doom3.  I know this can't be that difficult, and I know these things usually work out to be something rather simplistic thats right infront of my face, I've just run out of ideas.  Any Help would be greatful.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p179923" date="Posted: Tue Jun 05, 2007 5:17 pm "><author>hyperion_5</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I wrote this script and you can find my forum topic on this here:&#13;<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=19710">http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=19710</a><!-- m --></div>]]></body></post><post id="p178144" date="Posted: Mon May 14, 2007 5:14 pm "><author>kensvehla</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">While I have been reading these forums for awhile, I've been banging my head against the wall for far too long with this MD5 Quake IV export issue and finally broke down and made this post.  &#13;<br /><br />   First off I have a very familiar knowledge with past Id engines, I am very familiar with Quake IV all around except for the MD5 issues.
