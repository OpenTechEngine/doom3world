I'm assuming that's a typo?  Anyway, sure you can blend two textures in Photoshop if you want.  You can definately get the kind of blend you want at the expense of more textures used however you can use a simple overlay blend (I think it's overlay) by vertex painting a patch or patches and importing that into Radiant.  This was how most of the blending was performed in D3 and Q4 to get things like dirt to rock or rock/dirt to floor blending, etc.</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

Considering I know about photoshop already but not about vertex painting I will probably get  consistantly better results using photoshop. Thanks.<br/>_________________<br/>Life is complex.
