<br /><br />Just thought I'd share an issue my mod team discovered.  It seems that when you run a mod, a copy is made of the gamex86.dll file, the doomkey file, and your doom configuration.   
<br /><br />The critical issue is the doomkey file, which contains your serial key for Doom3. 
<br /><br />Mod authors, likely test their mods before distribution by loading them up in their copy of Doom 3.  When this happens, a 'cache' copy of gamex86.dll gets put into the mod directory, as well as the mod author's doomkey file.   After testing, a mod author is likely to simply .zip or .rar the mod directory to create his distribution, thus including his own doomkey file in the mix. 
<br /><br />Thus I thought it prudent to warn everyone to remember to delete the doomkey file before packaging their mod for distribution.  (Also delete the gamex86.dll file in that directory, as its a duplicate of the one in the .pk4 file, and your doom config, as typically, people want to use their own.)</div>]]></body></post><post id="p58215" date="Posted: Thu Oct 21, 2004 4:20 pm "><author>Dante_uk</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I think this thread should be stickied and properly locked to save other people missing it, as this forum grows.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p58234" date="Posted: Thu Oct 21, 2004 5:21 pm "><author>TTK-Bandit</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">hmm i think there should only be one sticky with stupid questions and answers <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081122071414im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br />btw simply zipping the mod directory..  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081122071414im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /><br />I can't  agree to this. you should always know what files you need to zip.
<br />its dirty to zip all configs and temporary files you never need ingame.

<br /><br />I think the 1.3 patch corrected that doomkey problem, although it still copys over
<br /><br />gamex86.dll
<br />config.spec
<br />doomconfig.cfg (if its not there)
<br /><br />doomkey is not included no more as of patch 1.3</div>]]></body></post><post id="p162521" date="Posted: Sat Nov 18, 2006 5:21 am "><author>rich_is_bored</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Well at least you read the date.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p57912" date="Posted: Wed Oct 20, 2004 4:59 pm "><author>oofnish</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Hello,
