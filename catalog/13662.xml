<br /><br />But it's just an online distribution service. You purchase a game, it routes the download through their secure servers and that's the end of the transaction.

<br /><br />I think he was referring to the fact that xStream is a buy+download+update service, as opposed to Steam, which is that but also a platform you're forced to use to play any of your games. With xStream, your installed games keep the same directory structure as if they were installed from the CD, they are run independently; you don't need anything sleeping on your system or doing (exploitable) client-side checks ala Steam.

<br /><br />You don't have to be connected to Steam to run Half Life 2 it just requires some creative coding.

<br /><br />I think he was referring to the fact that xStream is a buy+download+update service, as opposed to Steam, which is that but also a platform you're forced to use to play any of your games. With xStream, your installed games keep the same directory structure as if they were installed from the CD, they are run independently; you don't need anything sleeping on your system or doing (exploitable) client-side checks ala Steam.

<br /><br />You don't have to be connected to Steam to run Half Life 2 it just requires some creative coding.  Seen it done.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225073021im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p134124" date="Posted: Wed Feb 22, 2006 4:32 am "><author>zeh</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">rtkwe wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">You don't have to be connected to Steam to run Half Life 2 it just requires some creative coding.

<br /><br />Well, this is akin to saying "you don't need to buy a game to play it, it just requires some creative coding". I was talking from a legal or official point of view, of course. The fact that Steam forces a legitimate player to go through all levels of crap just to play the goddamned game is what makes me sad.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p139641" date="Posted: Tue Apr 11, 2006 12:59 am "><author>romperstomper</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Steam = The Soviet Union of IT Bizz, or Nazi germany if you will,
