<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">This month we're planning map releases for both Day of Defeat: Source and Counter-Strike: Source. For Day of Defeat, we'll be releasing a completely rebuilt version of the classic map Kalt. Known as a balanced level set in winter (in German, Kalt means "cold"), Kalt is also a good choice for players who are new to Day of Defeat. For this release, there has even been some custom rendering work done in the Source engine specifically to make the snow and ice look realistic.</div>
