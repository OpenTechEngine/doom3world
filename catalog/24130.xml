Of course, all other formats still should work as well. I must admit that I haven't tried these hacked Doom 3 executables with 3Dc normals, but I've ran both Doom 3 and TDM with them, and everything seems was ok. Does anyone want to try?<br />If it so, please notice that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225035322/http://www.sendspace.com/file/8ee2nk" class="postlink">my archive</a> consists of two executables: Doom3_LATC.exe and Doom3_RGTC.exe. Jean Michel Paul van Waveren, id Software, and Ignacio Castaño, nVidia, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225035322/http://developer.nvidia.com/object/real-time-normal-map-dxt-compression.html" class="postlink">think that LATC is more convenient than RGTC in some cases</a>, so I provide both versions: LATC and RGTC.<br />I must warn you: there is no warranty that these executables will work as it should, so use it on your own risk. And because those two OpenGL extensions (GL_EXT_texture_compression_latc/rgtc) are required a DX10-compatible hardware (ATI/AMD Radeon HD 2xxx and higher, nVidia GeForce 8xxx and higher), please don't try to run my hacked executables on a DX9-compatible hardware and earlier.</div>]]></body></post></posts></thread></xml>
