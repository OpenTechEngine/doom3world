<br />That makes it very hard to skip quickly through a thread for informations and dial up users (still the majority) will associate such a page with WorldWideWait while downloading "useless" decorations for sig's.
<br /><br />Take a look at your own forums:
<br />Is more space for valuable informations reserved, does it get wasted for oversized signatures with 200 animated smileys?
<br /><br />No offense - just an observation.
<br /><br />BTW - the overall webdesign of your site is rather slick.

<br />That makes it very hard to skip quickly through a thread for informations and dial up users (still the majority) will associate such a page with WorldWideWait while downloading "useless" decorations for sig's.
<br /><br />Take a look at your own forums:
<br />Is more space for valuable informations reserved, does it get wasted for oversized signatures with 200 animated smileys?
<br /><br />No offense - just an observation.
<br /><br />BTW - the overall webdesign of your site is rather slick. No useless javascript code, no 1024 x 320 head banner and so on - thanks.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p3683" date="Posted: Wed Jan 08, 2003 2:44 pm "><author>OSIAS</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">hello this is  atest</div>]]></body></post><post id="p3803" date="Posted: Thu Jan 16, 2003 9:04 pm "><author>Unrealizer</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Hi all,

<br /><br />I'm a fantasy artist with a bent for realistic 2D digital paintings, and am perhaps notorious for working on peices for months, in some cases years, I started off in traditional, but moved to digital and loved it, cutting my teeth in photo-manipulation, then digital painting using the same texture manipulating skills I gained from manipulating photos.
<br /><br />I'm interested in moving to 3D and the excitement of the doom3 game engine really fueled that, but I've found learning to use 3D packages a bit daunting and difficult, I probably won't be posting much here, since I'm unable to produce anything worth looking at right now in 3D type stuff, but I'm patient if nothing else, I think my main concern is rebuilding my self confidence and learn again to take things a step at a time.

I just can´t wait to get the newest infos of the projects and for the newest infos I need to go to the source  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081113013519im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p176658" date="Posted: Tue Apr 24, 2007 3:34 pm "><author>booman</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">hey Tesp!

<br /><br />Sure, thanks <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081113072056im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />It has become quite a fashion nowadays to link web page sized pictures or movie like gifs into the signature.
<br />That makes it very hard to skip quickly through a thread for informations and dial up users (still the majority) will associate such a page with WorldWideWait while downloading "useless" decorations for sig's.
<br /><br />Take a look at your own forums:
<br />Is more space for valuable informations reserved, does it get wasted for oversized signatures with 200 animated smileys?
<br /><br />No offense - just an observation.
<br /><br />BTW - the overall webdesign of your site is rather slick. No useless javascript code, no 1024 x 320 head banner and so on - thanks.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p3683" date="Posted: Wed Jan 08, 2003 2:44 pm "><author>OSIAS</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">hello this is  atest</div>]]></body></post><post id="p3803" date="Posted: Thu Jan 16, 2003 9:04 pm "><author>Unrealizer</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Hi all,

<br />That makes it very hard to skip quickly through a thread for informations and dial up users (still the majority) will associate such a page with WorldWideWait while downloading "useless" decorations for sig's.
<br /><br />Take a look at your own forums:
<br />Is more space for valuable informations reserved, does it get wasted for oversized signatures with 200 animated smileys?
<br /><br />No offense - just an observation.
<br /><br />BTW - the overall webdesign of your site is rather slick. No useless javascript code, no 1024 x 320 head banner and so on - thanks.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p3683" date="Posted: Wed Jan 08, 2003 2:44 pm "><author>OSIAS</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">hello this is  atest</div>]]></body></post><post id="p3803" date="Posted: Thu Jan 16, 2003 9:04 pm "><author>Unrealizer</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Hi all,

<br /><br />I'm a fantasy artist with a bent for realistic 2D digital paintings, and am perhaps notorious for working on peices for months, in some cases years, I started off in traditional, but moved to digital and loved it, cutting my teeth in photo-manipulation, then digital painting using the same texture manipulating skills I gained from manipulating photos.
<br /><br />I'm interested in moving to 3D and the excitement of the doom3 game engine really fueled that, but I've found learning to use 3D packages a bit daunting and difficult, I probably won't be posting much here, since I'm unable to produce anything worth looking at right now in 3D type stuff, but I'm patient if nothing else, I think my main concern is rebuilding my self confidence and learn again to take things a step at a time.

<br />That makes it very hard to skip quickly through a thread for informations and dial up users (still the majority) will associate such a page with WorldWideWait while downloading "useless" decorations for sig's.
<br /><br />Take a look at your own forums:
<br />Is more space for valuable informations reserved, does it get wasted for oversized signatures with 200 animated smileys?
<br /><br />No offense - just an observation.
<br /><br />BTW - the overall webdesign of your site is rather slick. No useless javascript code, no 1024 x 320 head banner and so on - thanks.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p3683" date="Posted: Wed Jan 08, 2003 2:44 pm "><author>OSIAS</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">hello this is  atest</div>]]></body></post><post id="p3803" date="Posted: Thu Jan 16, 2003 9:04 pm "><author>Unrealizer</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Hi all,

<br />After a couple of weeks of reading about all the cool stuff happening in the MOD community I couldn't stand it anymore. I had to... Register.
<br />So I did.
<br /><br />So here I am. Recently started on my very first map for Quake 3 to learn the basics. That's right. All the screenshots, topics and that damned Doom3 Can Do It Too project convinced me to pick up mapping. Damn you all for the inspiration!

<br /><br />Before started here with doom3 I was modding wolfenstien 3d (yes - there are still many people who do this) and was quite good @ it! Made textures, maps and did some code. When I got my new computer I started looking round for a fun, easy to mpd 3D FPS game. Played a lot of Half Life 1 (why do people here hate Half- Life) but found the editor totally confusing. Stuffed around with XSI for HL2 before it came out but never bought the game. Got Doom 3 and found this site and I love it!!!! <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081116031703im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> Still going through the tuts learning how to map but am getting better. BIG difference between 2d and 3d mapping - your probably thinking 'well der!'.
<br /><br />Anyway I hope to become a good mapper -and maybe some modelling/code.

<br /><br />I don't think anyone here hates HL.  In fact I think you would find that most found it a lot of fun.

HL2 looks good but so does D3 so I guess it just depends what you are trying to do and what you like.

I just look at a game, appreciate what it can do and thank the people who improve on what it can't.

<br /><br />having no mapping-experience whatsoever i took a long hard look around the net in order to find the resources you need when you're starting from scratch.
<br /><br />and guess what: doom3world.org was by far the best thing out there -
<br />nowhere else did i find anything approximating the quality and quantity of your tutorials, nor of the resident community.
<br /><br />so thank you BNA!, Brain, Goliath, Mnemic and everyone else for making this site such a great place for newbies to start out!
<br /><br />kind regards

<br /><br />I'm a fantasy artist with a bent for realistic 2D digital paintings, and am perhaps notorious for working on peices for months, in some cases years, I started off in traditional, but moved to digital and loved it, cutting my teeth in photo-manipulation, then digital painting using the same texture manipulating skills I gained from manipulating photos.
<br /><br />I'm interested in moving to 3D and the excitement of the doom3 game engine really fueled that, but I've found learning to use 3D packages a bit daunting and difficult, I probably won't be posting much here, since I'm unable to produce anything worth looking at right now in 3D type stuff, but I'm patient if nothing else, I think my main concern is rebuilding my self confidence and learn again to take things a step at a time.

Anyways, college student attending the University of Advancing Technology in Tempe, AZ. Even though I have no previous modding experience to speak of, that did not stop one of my profs from saying, "Make a mod".

<br /><br />- I've been fiddling with 3dsmax for 3 years, know it very well.
<br /><br />- Can work as a 2d artist (textures, decals, gui assets, etc)
<br /><br />- I write electronic music, mostly ambient or digital imitation of prog/death metal and grindcore (sound quite real though <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081116031240im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> )

<br />After a couple of weeks of reading about all the cool stuff happening in the MOD community I couldn't stand it anymore. I had to... Register.
<br />So I did.

<br /><br />Before started here with doom3 I was modding wolfenstien 3d (yes - there are still many people who do this) and was quite good @ it! Made textures, maps and did some code. When I got my new computer I started looking round for a fun, easy to mpd 3D FPS game. Played a lot of Half Life 1 (why do people here hate Half- Life) but found the editor totally confusing. Stuffed around with XSI for HL2 before it came out but never bought the game. Got Doom 3 and found this site and I love it!!!! <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081116031703im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> Still going through the tuts learning how to map but am getting better. BIG difference between 2d and 3d mapping - your probably thinking 'well der!'.
<br /><br />Anyway I hope to become a good mapper -and maybe some modelling/code.

<br /><br />I don't think anyone here hates HL.  In fact I think you would find that most found it a lot of fun.   However what people here will argue against is that HL2 is the second coming and the attitiude that some HL2 players have in regards to Doom 3 tech.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p79689" date="Posted: Sun Feb 27, 2005 11:03 pm "><author>johnokaner</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Figured it was something along those lines. HL2 looks good but so does D3 so I guess it just depends what you are trying to do and what you like. I'm not one of those people who gets totally hyped up about a game and starts making bullshit claims about it can do! I just look at a game, appreciate what it can do and thank the people who improve on what it can't.

<br /><br />it is this site's fault that i started mapping for doom3 and not hl2 or unreal.
<br /><br />having no mapping-experience whatsoever i took a long hard look around the net in order to find the resources you need when you're starting from scratch.
<br /><br />and guess what: doom3world.org was by far the best thing out there -
<br />nowhere else did i find anything approximating the quality and quantity of your tutorials, nor of the resident community.
<br /><br />so thank you BNA!, Brain, Goliath, Mnemic and everyone else for making this site such a great place for newbies to start out!

<br /><br />I'm a fantasy artist with a bent for realistic 2D digital paintings, and am perhaps notorious for working on peices for months, in some cases years, I started off in traditional, but moved to digital and loved it, cutting my teeth in photo-manipulation, then digital painting using the same texture manipulating skills I gained from manipulating photos.
<br /><br />I'm interested in moving to 3D and the excitement of the doom3 game engine really fueled that, but I've found learning to use 3D packages a bit daunting and difficult, I probably won't be posting much here, since I'm unable to produce anything worth looking at right now in 3D type stuff, but I'm patient if nothing else, I think my main concern is rebuilding my self confidence and learn again to take things a step at a time.

Never tried editing with an ID/Carmack engine before, i know a little bit of how to use UnrealED but thats as far as it goes. I have to say i'm well impressed with the D3 editor so far even though i havent done much with it yet, its a bit weird for me compared to using Unreal, but i think i'm going to like this editor better.
<br /><br />Anyway, i'll most probably lurk 90% of the time and see what info i can pick up from all the experienced people here. And i'll try not to post too much useless crap lol

For 2 years I  haven't played anything seriously nor done any mapping. Now that DooM III is finally out I'm really looking forward to build some maps.

<br /><br />I've been bumbling about the boards for a time, but it's time for a 'formal introduction'.
<br /><br />I'm currently working as a visual effects technical director for feature films. I have been working in the industry since the turn of the century and have been video game programming in various languages (yes, starting with basic) since I was 9. And yeah, I have 6 years of vintage Quake-C programming experience. (It's such a malleable and easy-to-code language!)
<br /><br />Anyways, I deal with a lot of particle effect animation for things that are too arduous to do by hand and AI simulations. This means lots of debris, weather effects, swarm AI and other stuff. I also solve problems with Maya, Mental Ray, Renderman and our proprietary rendering system. I develop software in C++, Java and MEL. Um, I have no formal programming education, I've just do so much that it's about as natural as breathing.
<br /><br />I'm looking to get out of my current career some day and start my own video games company, but for the time being, I have also been honing my drawing skills (I've been seriously drawing for about 3 years, and attending life drawing sessions for about two years, at least twice a week).  I'm thinking the 'own-your-own-game-company' thingy will be about seven years from now. First, I have to go off to Paris and draw (and stay away from computers) until a year passes or I become friggin' amazing at drawing.
<br /><br />All that and I also like making music on my laptop PC with FL studio and Ableton Live, but that's because I'm the only person on earth who ignores email spam to have my organ enlarged and as a result I am shunned by the opposite sex.
<br /><br />Anyways, I'm here to provide a little insight and expertise with game modding (I've been at it for a loong time, and this stuff is lots more fun than working on movies) but I've limited time to spend since work gets crazy now and then. Please, don't make any private calls for help -- just post your stuff on the board and if I happen to graze upon it and a thought comes to mind, I'll try to lend a hand.
<br /><br />Happy modding folks!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p59040" date="Posted: Mon Oct 25, 2004 8:07 pm "><author>matt_sefton</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Hi everyone -
<br /><br />Matt here - I'm heading up the Doom 3 Closed Caption and Transcription Modification Project for deaf and hearing impaired gamers that some of you might have heard about.
<br /><br />Many, many years ago (heh!) I ran quite a popular level review site on PlanetQuake - Single Player Quake Level Heaven - that morphed into SPQ2 Level Heaven, before my first child came along and put a stop to all that frivolity <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081117070525im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> I also built many maps for Doom, Doom 2, Quake, Quake 2, Quake 3 and Heretic 2. Until Doom 3 came out, I hadn't touched a game for nearly 6 years, so I decided to jump headfirst back into things. I'm not building maps anymore - I decided to learn 3DS Max instead.
<br /><br />So that's about it from me. If there's any gamers out there who would like to help out on the Doom3[CC] project translating the transcriptions into foreign languages, give me a shot. We have Spanish, German, French, Italian and Brazilian Portuguese underway, but any other languages from territories where the game has been released are most welcome.
<br /><br />Cheers!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p59310" date="Posted: Wed Oct 27, 2004 5:28 am "><author>mouse</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Hey people,

<br /><br />The name is Overmind, or most just call me Over. Funny Story: I was playing a game and I was introduced to a character named Undertaker, it went something like this, "Over this is Under, Under Over." Anyways, college student attending the University of Advancing Technology in Tempe, AZ. Even though I have no previous modding experience to speak of, that did not stop one of my profs from saying, "Make a mod".

<br /><br />Hello, I'm Shanjaq and I'm a modaholic.  It all started with Doom, moved on to Heretic and Hexen, then Quake and Hexen II, then Morrowind and X2 and now full circle to Doom3.  In fact I bought Tricks of the Doom Gurus before I had a registered copy of Doom(I thought it would work with the Shareware episode, what a disappointment it didn't!)

<br /><br />My name is BackFromTheDead, I am 15 years old (will be 16 in December), and I live in an absolutely awful country called Russia <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081116031240im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> I've been a classic Doom fan since it came out (yeah, when I was 4 years old I played Doom! <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081116031240im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> ), and I am rather experienced in Old Doom editing &amp; modding (did many sp levels and an unfinished TC for EDGE called Imp's Tales <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081116031240im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> ) When D3 came out I thought it is a perfect ground for modding, and started learning all aspects of it (which is double hard for me, because unlike most of you I don't have a background of Quake editing) For now I know the map editor quite well, also learning about the scripts and gui format. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081116031240im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />I would like you all to know that I'm free for recruiting and I'll happily work in a mod team, here are my skills:
<br /><br />- I've been fiddling with 3dsmax for 3 years, know it very well.
<br /><br />- Can work as a 2d artist (textures, decals, gui assets, etc)
<br /><br />- I write electronic music, mostly ambient or digital imitation of prog/death metal and grindcore (sound quite real though <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081116031240im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> )
<br /><br />So, please hire me for a mod, never acted in something like that before.
<br /><br />Excuse me for my weak English, can't do anything about it  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081116031240im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p62316" date="Posted: Mon Nov 08, 2004 11:37 pm "><author>RiotGear</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I'm a 20-year-old (10 days to drinking age) computer addict.

<br />That makes it very hard to skip quickly through a thread for informations and dial up users (still the majority) will associate such a page with WorldWideWait while downloading "useless" decorations for sig's.
<br /><br />Take a look at your own forums:
<br />Is more space for valuable informations reserved, does it get wasted for oversized signatures with 200 animated smileys?
<br /><br />No offense - just an observation.
<br /><br />BTW - the overall webdesign of your site is rather slick. No useless javascript code, no 1024 x 320 head banner and so on - thanks.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p3683" date="Posted: Wed Jan 08, 2003 2:44 pm "><author>OSIAS</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">hello this is  atest</div>]]></body></post><post id="p3803" date="Posted: Thu Jan 16, 2003 9:04 pm "><author>Unrealizer</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Hi all,

<br /><br />Sure, thanks <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081119000759im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />It has become quite a fashion nowadays to link web page sized pictures or movie like gifs into the signature.
<br />That makes it very hard to skip quickly through a thread for informations and dial up users (still the majority) will associate such a page with WorldWideWait while downloading "useless" decorations for sig's.
<br /><br />Take a look at your own forums:
<br />Is more space for valuable informations reserved, does it get wasted for oversized signatures with 200 animated smileys?
<br /><br />No offense - just an observation.
<br /><br />BTW - the overall webdesign of your site is rather slick. No useless javascript code, no 1024 x 320 head banner and so on - thanks.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p3683" date="Posted: Wed Jan 08, 2003 2:44 pm "><author>OSIAS</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">hello this is  atest</div>]]></body></post><post id="p3803" date="Posted: Thu Jan 16, 2003 9:04 pm "><author>Unrealizer</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Hi all,

<br /><br />Well, in the unlikely event anyone re-reads this <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081113012545im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> , I think my brain melted after keeping my reply to ViPr coherant, and entirely forgot to mention relevant bits you might be actually interested in <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081113012545im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" /> ...
<br /><br />I'm a fantasy artist with a bent for realistic 2D digital paintings, and am perhaps notorious for working on peices for months, in some cases years, I started off in traditional, but moved to digital and loved it, cutting my teeth in photo-manipulation, then digital painting using the same texture manipulating skills I gained from manipulating photos.
<br /><br />I'm interested in moving to 3D and the excitement of the doom3 game engine really fueled that, but I've found learning to use 3D packages a bit daunting and difficult, I probably won't be posting much here, since I'm unable to produce anything worth looking at right now in 3D type stuff, but I'm patient if nothing else, I think my main concern is rebuilding my self confidence and learn again to take things a step at a time.

<br />I am really total newbie to level editing, graphics. But I believe I will find this board very useful <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081116031313im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Thanks.

I'm applying for a job over at the Recall to Hell mod team. Figured this is one of the larger doom community forums so why not register? About time <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081116031313im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p148601" date="Posted: Wed Jul 05, 2006 5:42 pm "><author>Quickstep</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Hello <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081116031313im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />I'm delurking after about a 5 year lay off, basically since the registration was enforced here, I used to post a little before that as an annonymous poster, but never felt it really necesary to register, usually just rambled on incoherantly and signed off as Quickstep, I don't expect anyone will remember me, though anyone who can, are probably thinking oh no not him <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081116031313im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />.
<br /><br />Well anyway, I'm a lazy bum really, not too bright, but otherwise harmless, see you around <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081116031313im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> .
<br /><br />*Edit*
<br /><br />Well, in the unlikely event anyone re-reads this <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081116031313im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> , I think my brain melted after keeping my reply to ViPr coherant, and entirely forgot to mention relevant bits you might be actually interested in <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081116031313im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" /> ...
<br /><br />I'm a fantasy artist with a bent for realistic 2D digital paintings, and am perhaps notorious for working on peices for months, in some cases years, I started off in traditional, but moved to digital and loved it, cutting my teeth in photo-manipulation, then digital painting using the same texture manipulating skills I gained from manipulating photos.
<br /><br />I'm interested in moving to 3D and the excitement of the doom3 game engine really fueled that, but I've found learning to use 3D packages a bit daunting and difficult, I probably won't be posting much here, since I'm unable to produce anything worth looking at right now in 3D type stuff, but I'm patient if nothing else, I think my main concern is rebuilding my self confidence and learn again to take things a step at a time.

<br />That makes it very hard to skip quickly through a thread for informations and dial up users (still the majority) will associate such a page with WorldWideWait while downloading "useless" decorations for sig's.
<br /><br />Take a look at your own forums:
<br />Is more space for valuable informations reserved, does it get wasted for oversized signatures with 200 animated smileys?
<br /><br />No offense - just an observation.
<br /><br />BTW - the overall webdesign of your site is rather slick. No useless javascript code, no 1024 x 320 head banner and so on - thanks.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p3683" date="Posted: Wed Jan 08, 2003 2:44 pm "><author>OSIAS</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">hello this is  atest</div>]]></body></post><post id="p3803" date="Posted: Thu Jan 16, 2003 9:04 pm "><author>Unrealizer</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Hi all,

<br /><br />Sure, thanks <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081119000530im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />It has become quite a fashion nowadays to link web page sized pictures or movie like gifs into the signature.
<br />That makes it very hard to skip quickly through a thread for informations and dial up users (still the majority) will associate such a page with WorldWideWait while downloading "useless" decorations for sig's.
<br /><br />Take a look at your own forums:
<br />Is more space for valuable informations reserved, does it get wasted for oversized signatures with 200 animated smileys?
<br /><br />No offense - just an observation.
<br /><br />BTW - the overall webdesign of your site is rather slick. No useless javascript code, no 1024 x 320 head banner and so on - thanks.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p3683" date="Posted: Wed Jan 08, 2003 2:44 pm "><author>OSIAS</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">hello this is  atest</div>]]></body></post><post id="p3803" date="Posted: Thu Jan 16, 2003 9:04 pm "><author>Unrealizer</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Hi all,

<br /><br />Well, in the unlikely event anyone re-reads this <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081117071750im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> , I think my brain melted after keeping my reply to ViPr coherant, and entirely forgot to mention relevant bits you might be actually interested in <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081117071750im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" /> ...
<br /><br />I'm a fantasy artist with a bent for realistic 2D digital paintings, and am perhaps notorious for working on peices for months, in some cases years, I started off in traditional, but moved to digital and loved it, cutting my teeth in photo-manipulation, then digital painting using the same texture manipulating skills I gained from manipulating photos.
<br /><br />I'm interested in moving to 3D and the excitement of the doom3 game engine really fueled that, but I've found learning to use 3D packages a bit daunting and difficult, I probably won't be posting much here, since I'm unable to produce anything worth looking at right now in 3D type stuff, but I'm patient if nothing else, I think my main concern is rebuilding my self confidence and learn again to take things a step at a time.

<br /><br />After a long hiatus from id games playing Tribes2, I'm back for Doom3/Quake4.  I played too much QWTF, and then went on to major in ActionQuake 2 in college, making a couple DM skins for it along the way.  Maybe they're still on Polycount somewhere.
<br /><br />In my spare time from gaming I like to convert gasoline into noise, study history, and do professional web devepment.

<br />I got into Q4 Modelling/Mapping about a week ago.
<br />I did a lot of mapping for Q3 (years ago <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081117071713im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" />). Now it somehow feels like a

<br /><br />*Edit*
<br /><br />Well, in the unlikely event anyone re-reads this <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081117071713im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> , I think my brain melted after keeping my reply to ViPr coherant, and entirely forgot to mention relevant bits you might be actually interested in <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081117071713im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" /> ...
<br /><br />I'm a fantasy artist with a bent for realistic 2D digital paintings, and am perhaps notorious for working on peices for months, in some cases years, I started off in traditional, but moved to digital and loved it, cutting my teeth in photo-manipulation, then digital painting using the same texture manipulating skills I gained from manipulating photos.
<br /><br />I'm interested in moving to 3D and the excitement of the doom3 game engine really fueled that, but I've found learning to use 3D packages a bit daunting and difficult, I probably won't be posting much here, since I'm unable to produce anything worth looking at right now in 3D type stuff, but I'm patient if nothing else, I think my main concern is rebuilding my self confidence and learn again to take things a step at a time.

<br /><br />So hi everyone, nice to be back! <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081117212909im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />David</div>]]></body></post><post id="p174512" date="Posted: Thu Mar 29, 2007 6:58 pm "><author>Bo$bevok</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">first of all, welcome back  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081117212909im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Also, reading back to some of the posts I made two years ago, I wish I had never posted them!   </div>

<br />That makes it very hard to skip quickly through a thread for informations and dial up users (still the majority) will associate such a page with WorldWideWait while downloading "useless" decorations for sig's.
<br /><br />Take a look at your own forums:
<br />Is more space for valuable informations reserved, does it get wasted for oversized signatures with 200 animated smileys?
<br /><br />No offense - just an observation.

<br />That makes it very hard to skip quickly through a thread for informations and dial up users (still the majority) will associate such a page with WorldWideWait while downloading "useless" decorations for sig's.
<br /><br />Take a look at your own forums:
<br />Is more space for valuable informations reserved, does it get wasted for oversized signatures with 200 animated smileys?

<br />That makes it very hard to skip quickly through a thread for informations and dial up users (still the majority) will associate such a page with WorldWideWait while downloading "useless" decorations for sig's.

<br />That makes it very hard to skip quickly through a thread for informations and dial up users (still the majority) will associate such a page with WorldWideWait while downloading "useless" decorations for sig's.
