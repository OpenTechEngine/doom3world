My only problem is that the recoil doesn't work... most of the time.  Sometimes when I create a server it does work and weapons recoil like they would in singleplayer.  All of the values in the def files are fine:  muzzle_kick_time, muzzle_kick_maxtime, muzzle_kick_angles, muzzle_kick_offset, recoilTime, recoilAngles<br /><br />I think it might be a time related issue because I have another function that depends on time, a shield regeneration function that works like the armorgen, and it also works...sometimes.  It doesn't regenerate when the weapons also don't recoil so I think they are related and there is a timing problem.  If anyone has any idea what this could be please respond.  Right now it makes no sense to me why it would work sometimes and then not other times.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121014083506/http://strogguniverse.3owl.com/">http://strogguniverse.3owl.com</a><!-- m --></div>]]></body></post></posts></thread></xml>
