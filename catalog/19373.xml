<br /><br />I have a standard model from poser that I exported as a 3DS file, but 3dsmax 6 wont open it, perhaps the version is too old. If someone has a later version of 3dsmax would you try opening it? If it works can you export the model as an ASE file for me? It would be appreciated alot! I will be trying it with 3dsmax 7 later on today. I have also included a lightwave export from poser, so if that works for someone can you do the same and export it as ASE?

<br /><br />Perhaps another option would be a 3DS to ASE converter, but I havent found one so far.
<br /><br />What I want to do is bring the model in 3dsmax, edit it, build clothing and accessories for it, and use this as the high-poly version for normal map generation.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p176841" date="Posted: Thu Apr 26, 2007 11:50 am "><author>Lumpengnom</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I´m working with Max 8 and it works fine.
