<br /><br />Example, a question about the empty map error came up and the only thing I could think of is directory, something autosaved wrong grabing the information from doom.qe4.

"Aside from Christianity, I mean". 
<br /><br />It's very rare for me to want to boot someone, or make an example of what not to do. Screw it, i'm making an exception. I'm a pretty calm guy, talk to people with respect, then someone like this enters my day... just makes you all warm and fuzzy don't it? 
<br /><br />I think the option would have been "I disagree," or to just simply too say that "I don't think the paths are the problem... instead he/she  get's direspectful not only pissing me off but do you think the problem ever got solved? nope... side tracked by "Hugest piece of Bullshit."
<br />The point is, no one here is stupid, were trouble shooting and helping, there is no need too troll, flame, or think you know it all. 
<br /><br />So, this sticky is for all of those who think it's okay to falme bait the ops, or moderators, or owner of this site. The only way back to IRC after such a move is an appollogy. You continue it on the board and you will loose those privs too. No offence to those whom handle themselves correctly. If you find yourself banned from IRC, only way back in is to appologize to the op. If you choose instead to rant on in this arena (the forums) you will have to rant somewhere else.
<br /><br />Because this is a new rule, this person was not booted. This is just a warnning. Treat each other with respect, down talking, etc. Will not be tolerated.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p33786" date="Posted: Thu Aug 12, 2004 2:52 pm "><author>Jafo</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">There is a way to conduct yourself in the doom3world IRC channel, I would assume the first rule would be no discussions on warez the second would be don't piss off the ops.
