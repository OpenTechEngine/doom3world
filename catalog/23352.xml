Of course simply building a UT3 level you can use their static meshes as well. They still use brush for minor things like basic structure but static mesh is really the way things are built. The editor is not that hard to get into if you've done other game editing. If you bought the UT3 special edition you get a whole bunch of tutorial videos along with it from 3DBuzz that will teach a whole lot of stuff about the editor, building levels, making particle systems, materials, Kismet scripting.. etc. It's all very cool stuff.<br /><br />Of course the UDK has a newer version of the editor and engine than UT3 but it's all still very much the same, even if some stuff might look different here and there, they work basically the same still.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p221528" date="Posted: Fri Jan 01, 2010 2:09 am "><author>New Horizon</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Does the console work in any way in Wolfenstein?

Not to go negative on your point, but more control is a relevant term.  In most studios that follow the "Unreal" method of the mapmaking pipeline, level designers do less and less map building and more blockout and scripting.  Artists do most of the asset creation and final set dressing.  If you want to do both (map building and gameplay), stick with the 2 engines I mentioned.  id tech 4 is awesome but only one studio is confirmed still using it, albeit a highly modified version.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p221566" date="Posted: Sat Jan 02, 2010 10:56 pm "><author>aardwolf</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">The Happy Friar wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">pretty much all games used external assets for maps now a days.

I think source is the only current engine that still uses significant brushwork. Since around the time doom 3 was made the trend has been to move away from sculpting geometry in-editor and towards bulding meshes in max or maya. These days editors are mainly used for vis blocking, triggers and scripting, and blocking out.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p221594" date="Posted: Sun Jan 03, 2010 10:27 pm "><author>David_020</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">whitewolf wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">...The brush based method of making maps is basically a relic from the past.

I don't think anyone who played MW2 would say the environments look any poorer for being built in brushes.  It's really shaders and smart engine tweaks that made the difference in keeping it looking current gen.  Using a mesh-based system bloats a team into specialization, provides poor support for quick design iteration, and titles take forever to complete.  I don't think it's an improvement or considered evolution.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p223468" date="Posted: Fri Apr 02, 2010 1:55 am "><author>Ivan_the_B</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Seems like a good texture to me (except for the fact that there are little shadows in the diffusemap).</div>]]></body></post><post id="p223482" date="Posted: Fri Apr 02, 2010 3:55 pm "><author>Chr1s</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Sturm, broken record much?<br /><br />Was some pretty good textures used, you are just blinded by your hate for the title.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p223484" date="Posted: Fri Apr 02, 2010 5:33 pm "><author>=FF=Sturm</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Chr1s wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Was some pretty good textures used.</div><br />lol<br />Right, <span style="font-weight: bold">good textures for a 2003 game mod</span> but not for a <span style="font-weight: bold">2009 commercial title</span>...

Crappy maps, crappy classes, awful visuals and really poor gameplay meant that nobody would want to touch it online. The old RtCW (And on PC, ET) were mega hits online.

The worst thing is the game could have been saved if the MP was AT LEAST as good as the old game and all they had to do was copy it... Yet they even screwed that up. Crappy maps, crappy classes, awful visuals and really poor gameplay meant that nobody would want to touch it online. The old RtCW (And on PC, ET) were mega hits online.

Of course simply building a UT3 level you can use their static meshes as well. They still use brush for minor things like basic structure but static mesh is really the way things are built. The editor is not that hard to get into if you've done other game editing. If you bought the UT3 special edition you get a whole bunch of tutorial videos along with it from 3DBuzz that will teach a whole lot of stuff about the editor, building levels, making particle systems, materials, Kismet scripting.. etc. It's all very cool stuff.<br /><br />Of course the UDK has a newer version of the editor and engine than UT3 but it's all still very much the same, even if some stuff might look different here and there, they work basically the same still.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p221528" date="Posted: Fri Jan 01, 2010 2:09 am "><author>New Horizon</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Does the console work in any way in Wolfenstein?

Not to go negative on your point, but more control is a relevant term.  In most studios that follow the "Unreal" method of the mapmaking pipeline, level designers do less and less map building and more blockout and scripting.  Artists do most of the asset creation and final set dressing.  If you want to do both (map building and gameplay), stick with the 2 engines I mentioned.  id tech 4 is awesome but only one studio is confirmed still using it, albeit a highly modified version.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p221566" date="Posted: Sat Jan 02, 2010 10:56 pm "><author>aardwolf</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">The Happy Friar wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">pretty much all games used external assets for maps now a days.

Sometimes you just want a UV map. The whole idea of the brush is a product of the way the old bsp compiler worked in the days of yonder (and still does in id engines).

That's kind of a no brainer actually.<br /><br />Learn more things = good.</div><br /><br />I'm not advocating to forgo using 3d modeling programs.  That's crazy.  Those skills are necessary to create higher detail models when needed.  I don't think I ever said a "purely" brush-based system in my above posts.  Of course you need meshes for very detailed modeling even in a brush heavy system.<br /><br />As for the comments of CoD's recent engines (MW 1,2 and WaW) using heavy mesh work, that's inaccurate.  It's more brush-based and uses meshes for higher detail elements.    <br /><br />From my experience in using Unreal and Radiant, a brush-based system wins over because designers have more control and responsibility for their levels.  With a team using a mesh heavy system, the designer's role on environment work is lessen significantly.  So you say "Well, I have great modeling skills."  Excellent.  However, the studio structure will still "slot" you into a specialized designer role.  It's because they prize experts with a deep vertical slice of knowledge vs. broad skilled generalists.  When studios adopt this specialized approach, your chances to expand and demonstrate all those broad skills you gained are lessen.  And yes, there are still studios that look for generalist designers.  They are not a dead-end breed.      <br /><br />As for the comments on "don't worry, focus on brushwork over meshes", I never said that and please don't distort my words.  The point I tried to make is that the industry thinks that mesh-based systems are a panacea for great game design and scheduling.  It's not in my experience.  I prefer fast design iteration, smaller teams, and strong generalists.  I believe the technology choice can either help or hurt that position.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p221659" date="Posted: Tue Jan 05, 2010 11:47 pm "><author>=FF=Sturm</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">aardwolf wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">=FF=Sturm wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />+1<br /><br />Bad use of brushes + horrid light<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320003552/http://scrawlfx.com/gallery/albums/wolfenstein/march-19-2009/Wolfenstein_2009_03-19-09_01.jpg">http://scrawlfx.com/gallery/albums/wolf ... -09_01.jpg</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Good use of brushes + good light<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320003552/http://www.kn00tcn.net/kn-cod5edgewater.jpg">http://www.kn00tcn.net/kn-cod5edgewater.jpg</a><!-- m --></div><br /><br />Could I ask you to explain why they are good and bad uses of brush and light work in both cases, plz?

Probably a patch is considered necessary but not a SDK or support for the community by providing documentation or an official forum.

It's in a whole other league than (in my opinion) crap like Quake4 or Wolfailstein.<br />I also disagree about wolfailstein being one of the prettiest games made with idtech4 (or even that it's a good title). The game looked downright horrible. The textures were excrutiatingly bad and pimply and the generel design of the game was grey in grey. Wolfailstein had hype, but nobody cared because the released media was really really bad. Everybody could see it right from the "start". Everybody knew this was going to flop big time. The game sold like shit because the game is shit. Comparing it to Mass Effect 2 is almost insulting <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320002959im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> That game may have a large commercial engine feeding it, but the quality of the game speaks for itself. I played the first game and wasn't all that impressed. The sequel won me over like not many games have before it.<br /><br />Quake4 and Wolfailstein both suffer from being nobody's baby. Noone throughout development really cared for these games and it shows. They're generic, bland and hurt id software and their franchises more than they gain. It's not so weird id has decided to make all their AAA games in-house now.

It's in a whole other league than (in my opinion) crap like Quake4 or Wolfailstein.<br />I also disagree about wolfailstein being one of the prettiest games made with idtech4 (or even that it's a good title). The game looked downright horrible. The textures were excrutiatingly bad and pimply and the generel design of the game was grey in grey. Wolfailstein had hype, but nobody cared because the released media was really really bad. Everybody could see it right from the "start". Everybody knew this was going to flop big time. The game sold like shit because the game is shit. Comparing it to Mass Effect 2 is almost insulting <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320002235im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> That game may have a large commercial engine feeding it, but the quality of the game speaks for itself. I played the first game and wasn't all that impressed. The sequel won me over like not many games have before it.<br /><br />Quake4 and Wolfailstein both suffer from being nobody's baby. Noone throughout development really cared for these games and it shows. They're generic, bland and hurt id software and their franchises more than they gain. It's not so weird id has decided to make all their AAA games in-house now. Raven failed miserably.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p223668" date="Posted: Sat Apr 10, 2010 9:56 pm "><author>aardwolf</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I dont know if im right, but Carmack mentioned like 2 years ago that there was probably going to be a next Quake game, which would be a sequel to q3, and that it was going to be developed in-house.

Of course simply building a UT3 level you can use their static meshes as well. They still use brush for minor things like basic structure but static mesh is really the way things are built. The editor is not that hard to get into if you've done other game editing. If you bought the UT3 special edition you get a whole bunch of tutorial videos along with it from 3DBuzz that will teach a whole lot of stuff about the editor, building levels, making particle systems, materials, Kismet scripting.. etc. It's all very cool stuff.<br /><br />Of course the UDK has a newer version of the editor and engine than UT3 but it's all still very much the same, even if some stuff might look different here and there, they work basically the same still.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p221528" date="Posted: Fri Jan 01, 2010 2:09 am "><author>New Horizon</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Does the console work in any way in Wolfenstein?

Not to go negative on your point, but more control is a relevant term.  In most studios that follow the "Unreal" method of the mapmaking pipeline, level designers do less and less map building and more blockout and scripting.  Artists do most of the asset creation and final set dressing.  If you want to do both (map building and gameplay), stick with the 2 engines I mentioned.  id tech 4 is awesome but only one studio is confirmed still using it, albeit a highly modified version.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p221566" date="Posted: Sat Jan 02, 2010 10:56 pm "><author>aardwolf</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">The Happy Friar wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">pretty much all games used external assets for maps now a days.

Sometimes you just want a UV map. The whole idea of the brush is a product of the way the old bsp compiler worked in the days of yonder (and still does in id engines). The vis could only be calculated from convex polyhedra, so they came up with the slicing and dicing using the clipper tool.

That's kind of a no brainer actually.<br /><br />Learn more things = good.</div><br /><br />I'm not advocating to forgo using 3d modeling programs.  That's crazy.  Those skills are necessary to create higher detail models when needed.  I don't think I ever said a "purely" brush-based system in my above posts.  Of course you need meshes for very detailed modeling even in a brush heavy system.<br /><br />As for the comments of CoD's recent engines (MW 1,2 and WaW) using heavy mesh work, that's inaccurate.  It's more brush-based and uses meshes for higher detail elements.    <br /><br />From my experience in using Unreal and Radiant, a brush-based system wins over because designers have more control and responsibility for their levels.  With a team using a mesh heavy system, the designer's role on environment work is lessen significantly.  So you say "Well, I have great modeling skills."  Excellent.  However, the studio structure will still "slot" you into a specialized designer role.  It's because they prize experts with a deep vertical slice of knowledge vs. broad skilled generalists.  When studios adopt this specialized approach, your chances to expand and demonstrate all those broad skills you gained are lessen.  And yes, there are still studios that look for generalist designers.  They are not a dead-end breed.      <br /><br />As for the comments on "don't worry, focus on brushwork over meshes", I never said that and please don't distort my words.  The point I tried to make is that the industry thinks that mesh-based systems are a panacea for great game design and scheduling.  It's not in my experience.  I prefer fast design iteration, smaller teams, and strong generalists.  I believe the technology choice can either help or hurt that position.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p221659" date="Posted: Tue Jan 05, 2010 11:47 pm "><author>=FF=Sturm</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">aardwolf wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">=FF=Sturm wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />+1<br /><br />Bad use of brushes + horrid light<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320003552/http://scrawlfx.com/gallery/albums/wolfenstein/march-19-2009/Wolfenstein_2009_03-19-09_01.jpg">http://scrawlfx.com/gallery/albums/wolf ... -09_01.jpg</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Good use of brushes + good light<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320003552/http://www.kn00tcn.net/kn-cod5edgewater.jpg">http://www.kn00tcn.net/kn-cod5edgewater.jpg</a><!-- m --></div><br /><br />Could I ask you to explain why they are good and bad uses of brush and light work in both cases, plz?

Probably a patch is considered necessary but not a SDK or support for the community by providing documentation or an official forum. The latest blockbusters like Modern Warfare 2 and Bad Company 2 are closed games with no custom maps... and map packs are sold like the one for Modern Warfare 2 for 15$!... so level designers and modders are bad.

It's in a whole other league than (in my opinion) crap like Quake4 or Wolfailstein.<br />I also disagree about wolfailstein being one of the prettiest games made with idtech4 (or even that it's a good title). The game looked downright horrible. The textures were excrutiatingly bad and pimply and the generel design of the game was grey in grey. Wolfailstein had hype, but nobody cared because the released media was really really bad. Everybody could see it right from the "start". Everybody knew this was going to flop big time. The game sold like shit because the game is shit. Comparing it to Mass Effect 2 is almost insulting <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320002959im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> That game may have a large commercial engine feeding it, but the quality of the game speaks for itself. I played the first game and wasn't all that impressed. The sequel won me over like not many games have before it.<br /><br />Quake4 and Wolfailstein both suffer from being nobody's baby. Noone throughout development really cared for these games and it shows. They're generic, bland and hurt id software and their franchises more than they gain. It's not so weird id has decided to make all their AAA games in-house now.

Of course simply building a UT3 level you can use their static meshes as well. They still use brush for minor things like basic structure but static mesh is really the way things are built. The editor is not that hard to get into if you've done other game editing. If you bought the UT3 special edition you get a whole bunch of tutorial videos along with it from 3DBuzz that will teach a whole lot of stuff about the editor, building levels, making particle systems, materials, Kismet scripting.. etc. It's all very cool stuff.<br /><br />Of course the UDK has a newer version of the editor and engine than UT3 but it's all still very much the same, even if some stuff might look different here and there, they work basically the same still.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p221528" date="Posted: Fri Jan 01, 2010 2:09 am "><author>New Horizon</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Does the console work in any way in Wolfenstein?

Not to go negative on your point, but more control is a relevant term.  In most studios that follow the "Unreal" method of the mapmaking pipeline, level designers do less and less map building and more blockout and scripting.  Artists do most of the asset creation and final set dressing.  If you want to do both (map building and gameplay), stick with the 2 engines I mentioned.  id tech 4 is awesome but only one studio is confirmed still using it, albeit a highly modified version.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p221566" date="Posted: Sat Jan 02, 2010 10:56 pm "><author>aardwolf</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">The Happy Friar wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">pretty much all games used external assets for maps now a days.

Sometimes you just want a UV map. The whole idea of the brush is a product of the way the old bsp compiler worked in the days of yonder (and still does in id engines).

That's kind of a no brainer actually.<br /><br />Learn more things = good.</div><br /><br />I'm not advocating to forgo using 3d modeling programs.  That's crazy.  Those skills are necessary to create higher detail models when needed.  I don't think I ever said a "purely" brush-based system in my above posts.  Of course you need meshes for very detailed modeling even in a brush heavy system.<br /><br />As for the comments of CoD's recent engines (MW 1,2 and WaW) using heavy mesh work, that's inaccurate.  It's more brush-based and uses meshes for higher detail elements.    <br /><br />From my experience in using Unreal and Radiant, a brush-based system wins over because designers have more control and responsibility for their levels.  With a team using a mesh heavy system, the designer's role on environment work is lessen significantly.  So you say "Well, I have great modeling skills."  Excellent.  However, the studio structure will still "slot" you into a specialized designer role.  It's because they prize experts with a deep vertical slice of knowledge vs. broad skilled generalists.  When studios adopt this specialized approach, your chances to expand and demonstrate all those broad skills you gained are lessen.  And yes, there are still studios that look for generalist designers.  They are not a dead-end breed.      <br /><br />As for the comments on "don't worry, focus on brushwork over meshes", I never said that and please don't distort my words.  The point I tried to make is that the industry thinks that mesh-based systems are a panacea for great game design and scheduling.  It's not in my experience.  I prefer fast design iteration, smaller teams, and strong generalists.  I believe the technology choice can either help or hurt that position.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p221659" date="Posted: Tue Jan 05, 2010 11:47 pm "><author>=FF=Sturm</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">aardwolf wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">=FF=Sturm wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />+1<br /><br />Bad use of brushes + horrid light<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320003552/http://scrawlfx.com/gallery/albums/wolfenstein/march-19-2009/Wolfenstein_2009_03-19-09_01.jpg">http://scrawlfx.com/gallery/albums/wolf ... -09_01.jpg</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Good use of brushes + good light<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320003552/http://www.kn00tcn.net/kn-cod5edgewater.jpg">http://www.kn00tcn.net/kn-cod5edgewater.jpg</a><!-- m --></div><br /><br />Could I ask you to explain why they are good and bad uses of brush and light work in both cases, plz?

Probably a patch is considered necessary but not a SDK or support for the community by providing documentation or an official forum.

It's in a whole other league than (in my opinion) crap like Quake4 or Wolfailstein.<br />I also disagree about wolfailstein being one of the prettiest games made with idtech4 (or even that it's a good title). The game looked downright horrible. The textures were excrutiatingly bad and pimply and the generel design of the game was grey in grey. Wolfailstein had hype, but nobody cared because the released media was really really bad. Everybody could see it right from the "start". Everybody knew this was going to flop big time. The game sold like shit because the game is shit. Comparing it to Mass Effect 2 is almost insulting <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320002959im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> That game may have a large commercial engine feeding it, but the quality of the game speaks for itself. I played the first game and wasn't all that impressed. The sequel won me over like not many games have before it.<br /><br />Quake4 and Wolfailstein both suffer from being nobody's baby. Noone throughout development really cared for these games and it shows. They're generic, bland and hurt id software and their franchises more than they gain. It's not so weird id has decided to make all their AAA games in-house now.
