<br /><br />==============================
<br /><br />It's done.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081120151333im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />This is a follow-up of Jafo's d3weditor clean shaders/materials pk4 file which served as a starting base for this new PAK. I won't print the complete stats here since those are included in the zip file (along with a readme file). However, here's a quick overlook:
<br /><br />66 materials commented out in Jafo's PAK were in fact good.
<br />53 materials in Jafo's PAK were in fact broken.
<br />These materials were uncommented/commented out accordingly.
<br /><br />But the main difference lies in the fact tht this new PAK has 193 new TGA's to provide for qer_editorimages that were either missing or did not adequately depict what the texture really looks like in the game. Some of you who are currently designing maps in DoomEdit may think this PAK is just eye candy. If so, then consider these figures (compiled at the end of this project):
<br /><br />//=========== Global textures/_ materials stats==============
<br />// 
<br />// Total # of textures/_ materials : 3708 
<br />// Total # of working shaders: 1950 (approx. 52.5%) 
<br />// Total # of Broken/CommentedOut shaders: 1614 (approx. 43.5%) 
<br />// Total # of shaders which can't be used for map texturing and kept by necessity: 144 (approx. 4%) 
<br />//==============================================
<br /><br />Now I noticed that many of the materials in the original .mtr files can be misleading. Those may seem to be working but are really broken because the material code calls for a single non-existent TGA. The result is a texture that will display on your brush/patch in the game but won't look right (for eg. a material in which only the specularmap parameter refers to a TGA file that doesn't exist while the bump and diffuse map TGA's <span style="font-weight: bold">do</span> exist).
<br /><br />That means there's a significant chance that you might unknowingly be using broken materials to texture your map's geometry. So this PAK not only improves the look and ease of use of DoomEdit's texture window, it also ensures that you use <span style="font-weight: bold">only</span> 100% working materials to texture your maps.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081120151333/http://www.pcgamemods.com/9082/" class="postlink">DoomEdit CleanMaterials Version 5</a>
<br />(approx 13MB download)
<br /><br />Notes:
<br />- Version 2 has fix for qer_mirror texture appearing on mirrors in game.
<br />- Version 3 fixes the demon spawndecal not appearing in game.
<br />- Version 4 adds the 6 new materials in the V1.1 game patch plus a cosmetic issue with the editorimage textures/editor/redge.tga. Please note that these new materials are not meant to be used for map texturing. They were added so that my PAK won't break the new chat and lag icons in the V1.1 patched game when playing in MP mode. That's the ONLY real change in the V4 CleanMats.
<br />- Version 5 is the final cleanup phase. All the remaining materials have now been cleaned up (models, light, fog, fx's, gui's, particles, etc.). I also improved the qer_editorimage for model based entities in CAM view while in skinned mode. Most monsters/NPC's displayed their displacement map as the editorimage by default. Static models often used their addblend map by default (which made them appear pitch black). Most now use the _local bumpmap which improves visibility and clarity in skinned mode.
<br /><br />- There are no new TGA files in this pak so it's the same size as the last version.
<br /><br />A few broken materials for the sentry character reside in the sentry.def file so you need to download my latest Clean def's PAK to make this 100% complete. Please check the "Editing resources" sticky post in this forum for the URL of the "Clean def's" thread

I did not add any new shaders/materials in the mtr files. All I (and Jafo) did was to comment out the broken materials so they don't get parsed by the editor, that's all.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I guess all the preview images you created from scratch will not be the problem, since these are editor only.</div><br /><br />That's right. The TGA file that the qer_editorimage parameter points to affects only what you see in the editor's texture window and in the CAM view. It has no effect on the the material in the game itself.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">But did some of the shaders e.g. have to be changed to differ from the originals?</div>
<br /><br />Absolutely not. That would have been the worst thing to do and I made it a point to never do that. All the shaders' code were left intact and original. My goal was not to "repair" anything. My goal was simply to sort out which materials really work and which ones don't work. The ones that don't work were commented out, the ones that DO work were left untouched except for the qer_editorimage to improve how it looks in the Texture window. And that's all there is to it.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p51119" date="Posted: Fri Sep 17, 2004 3:48 pm "><author>Brain Trepaning</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks a lot, this will be very helpful for many mappers.

<br /><br />I have D3 completely unpacked for mapping purposes.  I downloaded the pk4 and put it into base, but the editor is not reading it.
<br /><br />Is it true that the editor cannot mix unpacked with packed?  I ran into this same problem with .def files (I had D3 packed and it wasn't reading my custom .def files, which is what prompted me to unpack them in the first place).  Once I had unpacked the D3 files, my own def files read fine.  It seems like I've hit this issue again.
<br /><br />So bascially the question is, do I have to unpack the clean materials in my unpacked directory for them to read?

<br /><br />But, I'd advise that if you need to extract the vanilla pk4s for reference then you extract them to somewhere outside the Doom 3 folder. This way you don't have to worry about problems like this where something that should work doesn't.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p51184" date="Posted: Fri Sep 17, 2004 6:22 pm "><author>goliathvt</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Outstanding work!

<br /><br />You're very welcome. About the textures/common/mirror material, I found the reason why. Here's the material code:
<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">textures/common/mirror<br />{<br />   discrete      // never merge with other surfaces<br />   qer_editorimage textures/common/qer_mirror.tga<br />   solid<br />   mirror<br />   {<br />      blend add<br />      map textures/common/qer_mirror.tga<br />   }<br />}</div>
<br /><br />The TGA file "textures/common/qer_mirror.tga" is not present in the original game's pak004.pk4 , therefore you don't get this problem in the original game. The problem with this material is that that TGA image is used as a blendmap in the original code. It's not the qer_editorimage that causes this but the blend add stage.
<br /><br />Incidentally, I didn't create this image, my predecessor did. But ultimately it's my fault. I didn't test the textures/common materials thoroughly enough assuming there couldn't be anything wrong about those since they're so simple and straighforward.
<br /><br />I will fix that by renaming the qer_mirror.tga to something else and edit the qer_editorimage line to point to the renamed image instead. I won't change the blend add stage of course - the idea is that it must NOT find the TGA file it points to. The shader probably needs a blend add stage pointing to an inexistent texture to work properly (at least that's what I'm guessing). In any case, I musn't change the original shader code, I have to work around it.
<br /><br />The only downside is that you will get a "warning: textures/common/qer_mirror.tga not found" message when you load the material in the editor. But you won't see a "mirror" texture in your compiled maps anymore.
<br /><br />Oh well.... that's why I gave that editing pack Version numbers. Thanks for pointing out the booboo Docgalad. I will test all the textures/common materials throroughly this time and post a Version 2 ASAP.
<br /><br />UPDATE:
<br /><br />I checked all the textures/common and textures/editor materials in a compiled map and they all work. I uploaded the fixed Version 2 and updated the link in the top post.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p51379" date="Posted: Sat Sep 18, 2004 9:52 am "><author>indianajonesilm</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">WOW!!!!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081120151333im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br />I would just like to say THANK YOU to all involved in making this.

<br />Hmmm... this is the second time I tried to download the pack form your site (v1 and then v2) via FlashGet... I can download about 9 MB and then the download stops, any further attempts to resume download do not work. WTH? 
<br /><br />It is as if you only get a certain time to download the file (looks like 30 minutes exactly), and if your connect is not fast enough, you just can't download the file completely.

I did not add any new shaders/materials in the mtr files. All I (and Jafo) did was to comment out the broken materials so they don't get parsed by the editor, that's all.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I guess all the preview images you created from scratch will not be the problem, since these are editor only.</div><br /><br />That's right. The TGA file that the qer_editorimage parameter points to affects only what you see in the editor's texture window and in the CAM view. It has no effect on the the material in the game itself.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">But did some of the shaders e.g. have to be changed to differ from the originals?</div>
<br /><br />Absolutely not. That would have been the worst thing to do and I made it a point to never do that. All the shaders' code were left intact and original. My goal was not to "repair" anything. My goal was simply to sort out which materials really work and which ones don't work. The ones that don't work were commented out, the ones that DO work were left untouched except for the qer_editorimage to improve how it looks in the Texture window. And that's all there is to it.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p51119" date="Posted: Fri Sep 17, 2004 4:48 pm "><author>Brain Trepaning</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks a lot, this will be very helpful for many mappers.

<br /><br />Is it true that the editor cannot mix unpacked with packed?  I ran into this same problem with .def files (I had D3 packed and it wasn't reading my custom .def files, which is what prompted me to unpack them in the first place).  Once I had unpacked the D3 files, my own def files read fine.  It seems like I've hit this issue again.

<br /><br />You're very welcome. About the textures/common/mirror material, I found the reason why. Here's the material code:
<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">textures/common/mirror<br />{<br />   discrete      // never merge with other surfaces<br />   qer_editorimage textures/common/qer_mirror.tga<br />   solid<br />   mirror<br />   {<br />      blend add<br />      map textures/common/qer_mirror.tga<br />   }<br />}</div>
<br /><br />The TGA file "textures/common/qer_mirror.tga" is not present in the original game's pak004.pk4 , therefore you don't get this problem in the original game. The problem with this material is that that TGA image is used as a blendmap in the original code. It's not the qer_editorimage that causes this but the blend add stage.
<br /><br />Incidentally, I didn't create this image, my predecessor did. But ultimately it's my fault. I didn't test the textures/common materials thoroughly enough assuming there couldn't be anything wrong about those since they're so simple and straighforward.
<br /><br />I will fix that by renaming the qer_mirror.tga to something else and edit the qer_editorimage line to point to the renamed image instead. I won't change the blend add stage of course - the idea is that it must NOT find the TGA file it points to. The shader probably needs a blend add stage pointing to an inexistent texture to work properly (at least that's what I'm guessing). In any case, I musn't change the original shader code, I have to work around it.
<br /><br />The only downside is that you will get a "warning: textures/common/qer_mirror.tga not found" message when you load the material in the editor. But you won't see a "mirror" texture in your compiled maps anymore.
<br /><br />Oh well.... that's why I gave that editing pack Version numbers. Thanks for pointing out the booboo Docgalad. I will test all the textures/common materials throroughly this time and post a Version 2 ASAP.
<br /><br />UPDATE:
<br /><br />I checked all the textures/common and textures/editor materials in a compiled map and they all work. I uploaded the fixed Version 2 and updated the link in the top post.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p51379" date="Posted: Sat Sep 18, 2004 10:52 am "><author>indianajonesilm</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">WOW!!!!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225004143im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br />I would just like to say THANK YOU to all involved in making this.

<br /><br />First off, notice how all of the paks have the prefix "ZZ-".
<br /><br />The reason for this is because the engine loads PK4 files alphabetically. Therefore, these PK4s will be loaded last.
<br /><br />Second, if you open the clean materials pak, you'll see that it contains a materials folder and within this folder are *.mtr files with the exact same names as the ones packaged with the game.
<br /><br />Now, each of these *.mtr files is pretty much an exact replica of the original file with one exception. The broken shaders are commented out.
<br /><br />The result is the stock mtr files loaded into memory are replaced with the modified versions. Hence, the broken shaders no longer show up because they've been commented out.
<br /><br />Now, the reason why this screws the game up is because when Eutectic created these paks, he added new content.
<br /><br />For instance, all of the material shaders that represent things like particle effects, ect... have been altered to illustrate that these textures are not intended to be applied to brushes.
<br /><br />So, the bottom line is that these paks are intended for use with the editor only. If you use it during gameplay, or during testing for that matter, things aren't going to work right.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p151982" date="Posted: Wed Aug 02, 2006 7:36 am "><author>Hemebond</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">rich_is_bored wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Now, the reason why this screws the game up is because when Eutectic created these paks, he added new content.<br /><br />For instance, all of the material shaders that represent things like particle effects, ect... have been altered to illustrate that these textures are not intended to be applied to brushes.</div>That's the part I didn't know.

<br /><br />Not in this case it isn't. I examined every single hit from this query and they all link to the old pcgamemods url, which is obviously out of date since the file isn't there. Actually, there's two or three distinct pcgamemods urls, but zero of them work -- all either give a 404 or a more obscure error message.
<br /><br />Looks like it was moved, and Google hasn't indexed any other location.

I won't print the complete stats here since those are included in the zip file (along with a readme file). However, here's a quick overlook:<br /><br />66 materials commented out in Jafo's PAK were in fact good.<br />53 materials in Jafo's PAK were in fact broken.<br />These materials were uncommented/commented out accordingly.<br /><br />But the main difference lies in the fact tht this new PAK has 193 new TGA's to provide for qer_editorimages that were either missing or did not adequately depict what the texture really looks like in the game. Some of you who are currently designing maps in DoomEdit may think this PAK is just eye candy. If so, then consider these figures (compiled at the end of this project):<br /><br />//=========== Global textures/_ materials stats==============<br />// <br />// Total # of textures/_ materials : 3708 <br />// Total # of working shaders: 1950 (approx. 52.5%) <br />// Total # of Broken/CommentedOut shaders: 1614 (approx. 43.5%) <br />// Total # of shaders which can't be used for map texturing and kept by necessity: 144 (approx. 4%) <br />//==============================================<br /><br />Now I noticed that many of the materials in the original .mtr files can be misleading. Those may seem to be working but are really broken because the material code calls for a single non-existent TGA. The result is a texture that will display on your brush/patch in the game but won't look right (for eg. a material in which only the specularmap parameter refers to a TGA file that doesn't exist while the bump and diffuse map TGA's <span style="font-weight: bold">do</span> exist).<br /><br />That means there's a significant chance that you might unknowingly be using broken materials to texture your map's geometry. So this PAK not only improves the look and ease of use of DoomEdit's texture window, it also ensures that you use <span style="font-weight: bold">only</span> 100% working materials to texture your maps.<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320010639/http://www.pcgamemods.com/9082/" class="postlink">DoomEdit CleanMaterials Version 5</a><br />(approx 13MB download)<br /><br />Notes:<br />- Version 2 has fix for qer_mirror texture appearing on mirrors in game.<br />- Version 3 fixes the demon spawndecal not appearing in game.<br />- Version 4 adds the 6 new materials in the V1.1 game patch plus a cosmetic issue with the editorimage textures/editor/redge.tga. Please note that these new materials are not meant to be used for map texturing. They were added so that my PAK won't break the new chat and lag icons in the V1.1 patched game when playing in MP mode. That's the ONLY real change in the V4 CleanMats.<br />- Version 5 is the final cleanup phase. All the remaining materials have now been cleaned up (models, light, fog, fx's, gui's, particles, etc.). I also improved the qer_editorimage for model based entities in CAM view while in skinned mode. Most monsters/NPC's displayed their displacement map as the editorimage by default. Static models often used their addblend map by default (which made them appear pitch black). Most now use the _local bumpmap which improves visibility and clarity in skinned mode.<br /><br />- There are no new TGA files in this pak so it's the same size as the last version.<br /><br />A few broken materials for the sentry character reside in the sentry.def file so you need to download my latest Clean def's PAK to make this 100% complete. Please check the "Editing resources" sticky post in this forum for the URL of the "Clean def's" thread<br /><br />PS: Mods please update links in other posts to point to this one (if required).

I did not add any new shaders/materials in the mtr files. All I (and Jafo) did was to comment out the broken materials so they don't get parsed by the editor, that's all.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I guess all the preview images you created from scratch will not be the problem, since these are editor only.</div><br /><br />That's right. The TGA file that the qer_editorimage parameter points to affects only what you see in the editor's texture window and in the CAM view.

<br /><br />Absolutely not. That would have been the worst thing to do and I made it a point to never do that. All the shaders' code were left intact and original. My goal was not to "repair" anything. My goal was simply to sort out which materials really work and which ones don't work. The ones that don't work were commented out, the ones that DO work were left untouched except for the qer_editorimage to improve how it looks in the Texture window. And that's all there is to it.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p51119" date="Posted: Fri Sep 17, 2004 4:48 pm "><author>Brain Trepaning</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks a lot, this will be very helpful for many mappers.

<br /><br />Is it true that the editor cannot mix unpacked with packed?  I ran into this same problem with .def files (I had D3 packed and it wasn't reading my custom .def files, which is what prompted me to unpack them in the first place).  Once I had unpacked the D3 files, my own def files read fine.  It seems like I've hit this issue again.

<br /><br />You're very welcome. About the textures/common/mirror material, I found the reason why. Here's the material code:
<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">textures/common/mirror<br />{<br />   discrete      // never merge with other surfaces<br />   qer_editorimage textures/common/qer_mirror.tga<br />   solid<br />   mirror<br />   {<br />      blend add<br />      map textures/common/qer_mirror.tga<br />   }<br />}</div>
<br /><br />The TGA file "textures/common/qer_mirror.tga" is not present in the original game's pak004.pk4 , therefore you don't get this problem in the original game. The problem with this material is that that TGA image is used as a blendmap in the original code. It's not the qer_editorimage that causes this but the blend add stage.
<br /><br />Incidentally, I didn't create this image, my predecessor did. But ultimately it's my fault. I didn't test the textures/common materials thoroughly enough assuming there couldn't be anything wrong about those since they're so simple and straighforward.
<br /><br />I will fix that by renaming the qer_mirror.tga to something else and edit the qer_editorimage line to point to the renamed image instead. I won't change the blend add stage of course - the idea is that it must NOT find the TGA file it points to. The shader probably needs a blend add stage pointing to an inexistent texture to work properly (at least that's what I'm guessing). In any case, I musn't change the original shader code, I have to work around it.
<br /><br />The only downside is that you will get a "warning: textures/common/qer_mirror.tga not found" message when you load the material in the editor. But you won't see a "mirror" texture in your compiled maps anymore.
<br /><br />Oh well.... that's why I gave that editing pack Version numbers. Thanks for pointing out the booboo Docgalad. I will test all the textures/common materials throroughly this time and post a Version 2 ASAP.
<br /><br />UPDATE:
<br /><br />I checked all the textures/common and textures/editor materials in a compiled map and they all work. I uploaded the fixed Version 2 and updated the link in the top post.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p51379" date="Posted: Sat Sep 18, 2004 10:52 am "><author>indianajonesilm</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">WOW!!!!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320010639im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br />I would just like to say THANK YOU to all involved in making this.

<br />Hmmm... this is the second time I tried to download the pack form your site (v1 and then v2) via FlashGet... I can download about 9 MB and then the download stops, any further attempts to resume download do not work. WTH? 
<br /><br />It is as if you only get a certain time to download the file (looks like 30 minutes exactly), and if your connect is not fast enough, you just can't download the file completely.

<br /><br />First off, notice how all of the paks have the prefix "ZZ-".
<br /><br />The reason for this is because the engine loads PK4 files alphabetically. Therefore, these PK4s will be loaded last.
<br /><br />Second, if you open the clean materials pak, you'll see that it contains a materials folder and within this folder are *.mtr files with the exact same names as the ones packaged with the game.
<br /><br />Now, each of these *.mtr files is pretty much an exact replica of the original file with one exception. The broken shaders are commented out.
<br /><br />The result is the stock mtr files loaded into memory are replaced with the modified versions. Hence, the broken shaders no longer show up because they've been commented out.
<br /><br />Now, the reason why this screws the game up is because when Eutectic created these paks, he added new content.
<br /><br />For instance, all of the material shaders that represent things like particle effects, ect... have been altered to illustrate that these textures are not intended to be applied to brushes.
<br /><br />So, the bottom line is that these paks are intended for use with the editor only. If you use it during gameplay, or during testing for that matter, things aren't going to work right.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p151982" date="Posted: Wed Aug 02, 2006 7:36 am "><author>Hemebond</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">rich_is_bored wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Now, the reason why this screws the game up is because when Eutectic created these paks, he added new content.<br /><br />For instance, all of the material shaders that represent things like particle effects, ect... have been altered to illustrate that these textures are not intended to be applied to brushes.</div>That's the part I didn't know.

No new declarations are added so there's no need to be concerned about dependancies.<br /><br />So, should you be using the paks during gameplay? No, for the reasons mentioned above by Skul.

They then stripped all the models etc that WASNT used in the GAME, this then broke other parts of the models leaving behind a nice mess for anyone who uses the editor to have to deal with.

<br /><br />==============================
<br /><br />It's done.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081120143800im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />This is a follow-up of Jafo's d3weditor clean shaders/materials pk4 file which served as a starting base for this new PAK. I won't print the complete stats here since those are included in the zip file (along with a readme file). However, here's a quick overlook:
<br /><br />66 materials commented out in Jafo's PAK were in fact good.
<br />53 materials in Jafo's PAK were in fact broken.
<br />These materials were uncommented/commented out accordingly.
<br /><br />But the main difference lies in the fact tht this new PAK has 193 new TGA's to provide for qer_editorimages that were either missing or did not adequately depict what the texture really looks like in the game. Some of you who are currently designing maps in DoomEdit may think this PAK is just eye candy. If so, then consider these figures (compiled at the end of this project):
<br /><br />//=========== Global textures/_ materials stats==============
<br />// 
<br />// Total # of textures/_ materials : 3708 
<br />// Total # of working shaders: 1950 (approx. 52.5%) 
<br />// Total # of Broken/CommentedOut shaders: 1614 (approx. 43.5%) 
<br />// Total # of shaders which can't be used for map texturing and kept by necessity: 144 (approx. 4%) 
<br />//==============================================
<br /><br />Now I noticed that many of the materials in the original .mtr files can be misleading. Those may seem to be working but are really broken because the material code calls for a single non-existent TGA. The result is a texture that will display on your brush/patch in the game but won't look right (for eg. a material in which only the specularmap parameter refers to a TGA file that doesn't exist while the bump and diffuse map TGA's <span style="font-weight: bold">do</span> exist).
<br /><br />That means there's a significant chance that you might unknowingly be using broken materials to texture your map's geometry. So this PAK not only improves the look and ease of use of DoomEdit's texture window, it also ensures that you use <span style="font-weight: bold">only</span> 100% working materials to texture your maps.

They were added so that my PAK won't break the new chat and lag icons in the V1.1 patched game when playing in MP mode. That's the ONLY real change in the V4 CleanMats.
<br />- Version 5 is the final cleanup phase. All the remaining materials have now been cleaned up (models, light, fog, fx's, gui's, particles, etc.). I also improved the qer_editorimage for model based entities in CAM view while in skinned mode. Most monsters/NPC's displayed their displacement map as the editorimage by default. Static models often used their addblend map by default (which made them appear pitch black). Most now use the _local bumpmap which improves visibility and clarity in skinned mode.
<br /><br />- There are no new TGA files in this pak so it's the same size as the last version.
<br /><br />A few broken materials for the sentry character reside in the sentry.def file so you need to download my latest Clean def's PAK to make this 100% complete. Please check the "Editing resources" sticky post in this forum for the URL of the "Clean def's" thread
<br /><br />PS: Mods please update links in other posts to point to this one (if required). Thanks.

I did not add any new shaders/materials in the mtr files. All I (and Jafo) did was to comment out the broken materials so they don't get parsed by the editor, that's all.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I guess all the preview images you created from scratch will not be the problem, since these are editor only.</div><br /><br />That's right. The TGA file that the qer_editorimage parameter points to affects only what you see in the editor's texture window and in the CAM view. It has no effect on the the material in the game itself.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">But did some of the shaders e.g. have to be changed to differ from the originals?</div>
<br /><br />Absolutely not. That would have been the worst thing to do and I made it a point to never do that. All the shaders' code were left intact and original. My goal was not to "repair" anything. My goal was simply to sort out which materials really work and which ones don't work. The ones that don't work were commented out, the ones that DO work were left untouched except for the qer_editorimage to improve how it looks in the Texture window. And that's all there is to it.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p51119" date="Posted: Fri Sep 17, 2004 3:48 pm "><author>Brain Trepaning</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks a lot, this will be very helpful for many mappers.

<br /><br />I have D3 completely unpacked for mapping purposes.  I downloaded the pk4 and put it into base, but the editor is not reading it.
<br /><br />Is it true that the editor cannot mix unpacked with packed?  I ran into this same problem with .def files (I had D3 packed and it wasn't reading my custom .def files, which is what prompted me to unpack them in the first place).  Once I had unpacked the D3 files, my own def files read fine.  It seems like I've hit this issue again.

<br /><br />You're very welcome. About the textures/common/mirror material, I found the reason why. Here's the material code:
<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">textures/common/mirror<br />{<br />   discrete      // never merge with other surfaces<br />   qer_editorimage textures/common/qer_mirror.tga<br />   solid<br />   mirror<br />   {<br />      blend add<br />      map textures/common/qer_mirror.tga<br />   }<br />}</div>
<br /><br />The TGA file "textures/common/qer_mirror.tga" is not present in the original game's pak004.pk4 , therefore you don't get this problem in the original game. The problem with this material is that that TGA image is used as a blendmap in the original code. It's not the qer_editorimage that causes this but the blend add stage.
<br /><br />Incidentally, I didn't create this image, my predecessor did. But ultimately it's my fault. I didn't test the textures/common materials thoroughly enough assuming there couldn't be anything wrong about those since they're so simple and straighforward.
<br /><br />I will fix that by renaming the qer_mirror.tga to something else and edit the qer_editorimage line to point to the renamed image instead. I won't change the blend add stage of course - the idea is that it must NOT find the TGA file it points to. The shader probably needs a blend add stage pointing to an inexistent texture to work properly (at least that's what I'm guessing). In any case, I musn't change the original shader code, I have to work around it.
<br /><br />The only downside is that you will get a "warning: textures/common/qer_mirror.tga not found" message when you load the material in the editor. But you won't see a "mirror" texture in your compiled maps anymore.
<br /><br />Oh well.... that's why I gave that editing pack Version numbers. Thanks for pointing out the booboo Docgalad. I will test all the textures/common materials throroughly this time and post a Version 2 ASAP.
<br /><br />UPDATE:
<br /><br />I checked all the textures/common and textures/editor materials in a compiled map and they all work. I uploaded the fixed Version 2 and updated the link in the top post.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p51379" date="Posted: Sat Sep 18, 2004 9:52 am "><author>indianajonesilm</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">WOW!!!!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081120143800im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br />I would just like to say THANK YOU to all involved in making this.

<br />Hmmm... this is the second time I tried to download the pack form your site (v1 and then v2) via FlashGet... I can download about 9 MB and then the download stops, any further attempts to resume download do not work. WTH?

Id's original code for the material textures/common/mirror (materials/invisible.mtr) is as follows:&#13;<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">textures/common/mirror<br />{<br />   discrete      // never merge with other surfaces<br />   qer_editorimage textures/common/qer_mirror.tga<br />   solid<br />   mirror<br />   {<br />      blend add<br />      map textures/common/qer_mirror.tga<br />   }<br />}</div><br /><br />Now the file <span style="font-weight: bold">textures/common/qer_mirror.tga</span> does not exist in Id's standard pak004.pk4. So when Jafo first worked on his clean shader PAK, he must have noticed that DoomEdit's Texture view only displayed an empty black square for it. So he created that 64x64 pixel texture with the word Mirror in black letters on it. He named it qer_mirror.tga and put it in the "common" folder inside his d3weditor PAK file.<br /><br />So now in DoomEdit's texture view, you see this custom qer_mirror.tga texture instead of a small black square and life is good right?.... Wrong!<br /><br />By doing this, he accidentally broke the shader. Why? Because if you look at the code above, the <span style="font-weight: bold">blend add</span> stage calls for the same texture: <span style="font-weight: bold">textures/common/qer_mirror.tga</span> . And this is the reason why the word Mirror in black letters appears on the game mirrors. Now the game <span style="font-weight: bold">does</span> find the texture (which it shouldn't in order to work properly).<br /><br />You see, the mirror material is an exeptional case: it doesn't need an actual texture to work. In fact it must NOT use one. But for some reason, perhaps a "dummy" <span style="font-weight: bold">blend add</span> stage is required to make it work properly. But the thing that really makes it a mirror is the "mirror" property in the material code.<br /><br />My fault was that I didn't try applying the mirror texture on a patch and compile the map to see what it looks like in the game. I just assumed it worked properly and I didn't check the shader code either. IOW, my mistake was that I failed to spot Jafo's mistake. I realized the above particularity about the mirror material only after someone else spotted it for me (and I thank him for that).<br /><br />Now. In order to fix it, qer_mirror.tga must not exist. But at the same time, I didn't want the Texture view in DoomEdit to display a black square as a result of not finding it. So the solution is to assign a <span style="font-weight: bold">different</span> texture to the qer_editorimage parameter than the one that's called in the blend add stage of the material (which must not exist).<br /><br />Since I won't change anything in the <span style="font-weight: bold">actual</span> material code by principle (anything else than the qer_editorimage parameter IOW), I renamed the qer_mirror.tga texture created by Jafo to <span style="font-weight: bold">qer_mirror_editor.tga</span> and I edited the qer_editorimage parameter in the material to point to THAT file instead.<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">textures/common/mirror<br />{<br />   discrete      // never merge with other surfaces<br />   qer_editorimage textures/common/qer_mirror_editor.tga<br />   solid<br />   mirror<br />   {<br />      blend add<br />      map textures/common/qer_mirror.tga<br />   }<br />}</div>&#13;<br /><br />So now, everybody's happy. The material is happy because it DOESN'T find qer_mirror.tga and mirrors works perfectly in the game. And the map designer is happy because DoomEdit's Texture window DOES find and display the 64x64 symbolic <span style="font-weight: bold">qer_mirror_editor.tga</span> texture. Then I rebuilt a new PAK file and distributed it as Version 2.&#13;<br /><br />Mnemic:&#13;<br /><br />If you see the word Mirror in black letters on mirrors in the game, that's due to one of the following 3 possibilities:&#13;<br /><br />1. You're using Jafo's PAK instead of mine (some people may have these 2 confused). With all due respect and IMHO, nobody should use that PAK because there are many errors in it (119 to be exact, apart from the mirror thing).&#13;<br /><br />2. You're using Version 1 of my PAK since this problem was fixed in Version 2 (and later)&#13;<br /><br />3. You're using Version 2 or later but you have extracted the content of my PAK to your hard drive (against the specific recommendation in my <span style="font-weight: bold">readme</span> file to NOT extract the content of the PAK). By extracting, you overwrote the invisible.mtr file and extracted qer_mirror_editor.tga but qer_mirror.tga did NOT get deleted as it should have. Thus, the shader STILL finds the texture that it should not find and remains broken. By keeping stuff inside PAK files and simply using new PAK's, you avoid any possiblity of such a problem occuring.&#13;<br /><br />NOTE:&#13;<br />If you want to extract stuff to look at it, go ahead but don't extract it in the game's base folder! That's asking for trouble.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p52398" date="Posted: Wed Sep 22, 2004 4:45 am "><author>Jafo</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">My bad on the mirror, I missed that it was using the same image as an alpha blend, kind of hard to do without an alpha channel:) So when the game didn't report a missing texture I did think life was good, as usual I should have looked in the mirror:) Thanks Eutectic for taking this to it's final step, I got pretty burnned out trying to clean up what seemed like 500 + shaders. PS, damn easy to break the alpha on some of those decals, might want to check the UAC decal too, I think I horked that one in the beginning. You ran into the same problems I did, env folder having odds and ends, like one of the id guys smoked a bowl then started dropping textures wherever he felt like it <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Also the BFG_wallmark (IT?) had me boggled cause I kept getting an error but it was fine. I did comment out some shaders that actually worked... even though I thought they did not, but I never found them being used in any of the maps. Well, great job, thanks for the final effort in this.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p52426" date="Posted: Wed Sep 22, 2004 8:16 am "><author>Eutectic</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Jafo wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">My bad on the mirror, I missed that it was using the same image as an alpha blend, kind of hard to do without an alpha channel </div><br /><br />Actually, it's an additive blendmap. Those don't require textures with an alpha channel. All this does is add the RGB value of every pixel in the texture to the RGB value of the pixels in texture underneath it. It's often used for the "illumination area" of light fixture textures.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Thanks Eutectic for taking this to it's final step, I got pretty burnned out trying to clean up what seemed like 500 + shaders.</div><br /><br />Uhh... More like 3700+ (look at the file named stats.txt inside the zip file). And I'm not counting the model, particle and gui, etc materials... <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"> PS, damn easy to break the alpha on some of those decals, might want to check the UAC decal too, I think I horked that one in the beginning.</div><br /><br />Which one? There are several "UAC decals". How about a material name please? I hope you don't mean that you tried to modify the shader code itself (other than qer_editorimage) in the attempt to "make them work". Gaaawd please tell me it ain't so because if it is, then I'm in deep doodoo since I used <span style="text-decoration: underline">your</span> modified files as a starting point for the job. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">You ran into the same problems I did, env folder having odds and ends, like one of the id guys smoked a bowl then started dropping textures wherever he felt like it <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div><br /><br />I don't really follow you here. The enviroment map textures in the env/ folder was the least of my worries.

I bogged down on those too until someone explained to me what the "vertexcolor" shader parameter is for (meant for models only, not map brushes and patches). The textures/decals/bfg_wallmark material is one of those I call "naming convention offender materials". One of many that should <span style="text-decoration: underline">never</span> have been named textures/<span style="font-style: italic">something</span> but rather something like models/weapons/<span style="font-style: italic">something</span> for eg.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I did comment out some shaders that actually worked... even though I thought they did not</div><br /><br />Yes, 66 to be exact. Not too bad considering theres 3700+ textures/<span style="font-style: italic">something</span> materials in the game's .mtr files<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">... but I never found them being used in any of the maps.</div><br /><br />They didn't break anything in the game then. However, it did take away 66 good shaders from the map designer's "texture palette". Not a biggie perhaps but I wanted to make sure the mappers get the most out of the Doom Editor.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Well, great job, thanks for the final effort in this.</div>&#13;<br /><br />You're welcome. I would appreciate if you clarified your UAC decal comment above. It's a rather burning question for me.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p52437" date="FIXME failed to extract"><author>bb_matt</author><body><![CDATA[<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>

						<div class="postbody">Thanks for this, I've just completed Doom 3 and I'm about to start level creation in earnest, so I'm sure this will be very helpful.&#13;<br /><br />However, I've come across a problem. The pentagram that appears (and then burns into the floor) when an imp or somesuch teleports in does not seem to display properly with the pk4. Instead it overlays badly for a while before disappearing, as per:&#13;<br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.bigscaryanimal.co.uk/graphics/clean_materials_pent.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />If you have an autosave for Central Processing handy then there is some handy examples right at the start of this level (at least on 'Marine' skill).&#13;<br /><br />I'm afraid pointing you towards the specific shader is a bit beyond me at the moment!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" /><br /><br />Thanks again for all your work!</div>

						<div class="postbody">Ok I uploaded a new fix: Version 3.&#13;<br /><br />Thanks cold_Fusion for his precious feedback. A silly oversight on my part, I had forgotten to uncomment the material <span style="font-style: italic">textures/decals/spawndecal</span> in decals.mtr which is used by the game during demon spawns (but must not be used for texturing map geometry however).&#13;<br /><br />If you're comfortable with WinZip, you can do the fix yourself easily without having to download a new version (assuming you already have V2). Here's how: &#13;<br /><br />- rename the pk4 to .zip and double-click on it to open the file in WinZip &#13;<br />- scroll to the file decals.mtr, right-click on it and select "view with NOTEPAD.EXE"&#13;<br />- scroll down to where the material <span style="font-weight: bold">textures/decals/spawndecal</span> is located&#13;<br />- remove the <span style="font-weight: bold">//</span> double-slashes at the beginning of every line of that shader/material&#13;<br />- edit the <span style="font-weight: bold">qer_editorimage</span> parameter to <span style="font-weight: bold">textures/editor/dontuse.tga</span>&#13;<br /><br />It should look like this when you're done:&#13;<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">textures/decals/spawndecal<br />{<br />   qer_editorimage textures/editor/dontuse.tga<br />   noselfShadow<br />    noshadows   <br />   translucent<br />   discrete<br />   nonsolid<br />   noimpact<br />   twosided<br /><br />   DECAL_MACRO<br />   decalInfo 0.75 10 ( 1 1 1 10 ) ( -5 -5 -5 0 )<br />   <br />   {       <br />      <br />         blend      gl_zero, gl_one_minus_src_alpha<br />      map         makealpha(textures/decals/spawndecal_burn)<br />      clamp      // we don't want it to tile if the projection extends past the bounds<br />      //rgb         decalFade[(time - Parm3)/(parm4 - parm3)]<br />      vertexColor   // oblique projections will be slightly faded down<br />   }<br /><br />   {<br />         blend   add  <br />      map      textures/decals/spawndecal<br />      //rgb      fireballtable[ time * .5 ]<br />      vertexColor   // oblique projections will be slightly faded down<br />   }<br />}</div>&#13;<br /><br />- save the file and close it, Winzip will notice the file has changed and ask you if you want to update the archive. Choose YES.&#13;<br />- that's it, your pak file is fixed. Just rename it to .pk4 again and you're ready to go.&#13;<br /><br />But if you have a broadband connection and don't mind DL'ing a 13MB file, then simply go to the top post of this thread to download V3 <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>

						<div class="postbody">That already has been fixed.  The problem is that an image remains from V1 that shouldn't be there at all:&#13;<br /><br />base/textures/common/mirror.tga&#13;<br /><br />V2 and V3 have fixed this by using a mirror_editor.tga image (or something like that) that is used only by the editor.  The material file(s) from V2 and V3 still point to "base/textures/common/mirror", but, like I said, there shouldn't be an actual image called mirror.tga in the common directory at all.&#13;<br /><br />When you updated to newer versions, there was no way to delete this unnecessary image (mirror.tga) so you have to do it yourself.  Leave the mirror_editor.tga one alone though.&#13;<br /><br />Goliath</div>

						<div class="postbody">Ok let me explain in better detail to make this perfectly clear. This problem was caused by a series of circumstances which have to be described in their chronoligical order to understand what happened. Id's original code for the material textures/common/mirror (materials/invisible.mtr) is as follows:&#13;<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">textures/common/mirror<br />{<br />   discrete      // never merge with other surfaces<br />   qer_editorimage textures/common/qer_mirror.tga<br />   solid<br />   mirror<br />   {<br />      blend add<br />      map textures/common/qer_mirror.tga<br />   }<br />}</div><br /><br />Now the file <span style="font-weight: bold">textures/common/qer_mirror.tga</span> does not exist in Id's standard pak004.pk4. So when Jafo first worked on his clean shader PAK, he must have noticed that DoomEdit's Texture view only displayed an empty black square for it. So he created that 64x64 pixel texture with the word Mirror in black letters on it. He named it qer_mirror.tga and put it in the "common" folder inside his d3weditor PAK file.<br /><br />So now in DoomEdit's texture view, you see this custom qer_mirror.tga texture instead of a small black square and life is good right?.... Wrong!<br /><br />By doing this, he accidentally broke the shader. Why? Because if you look at the code above, the <span style="font-weight: bold">blend add</span> stage calls for the same texture: <span style="font-weight: bold">textures/common/qer_mirror.tga</span> . And this is the reason why the word Mirror in black letters appears on the game mirrors. Now the game <span style="font-weight: bold">does</span> find the texture (which it shouldn't in order to work properly).<br /><br />You see, the mirror material is an exeptional case: it doesn't need an actual texture to work. In fact it must NOT use one. But for some reason, perhaps a "dummy" <span style="font-weight: bold">blend add</span> stage is required to make it work properly. But the thing that really makes it a mirror is the "mirror" property in the material code.<br /><br />My fault was that I didn't try applying the mirror texture on a patch and compile the map to see what it looks like in the game. I just assumed it worked properly and I didn't check the shader code either. IOW, my mistake was that I failed to spot Jafo's mistake. I realized the above particularity about the mirror material only after someone else spotted it for me (and I thank him for that).<br /><br />Now. In order to fix it, qer_mirror.tga must not exist. But at the same time, I didn't want the Texture view in DoomEdit to display a black square as a result of not finding it. So the solution is to assign a <span style="font-weight: bold">different</span> texture to the qer_editorimage parameter than the one that's called in the blend add stage of the material (which must not exist).<br /><br />Since I won't change anything in the <span style="font-weight: bold">actual</span> material code by principle (anything else than the qer_editorimage parameter IOW), I renamed the qer_mirror.tga texture created by Jafo to <span style="font-weight: bold">qer_mirror_editor.tga</span> and I edited the qer_editorimage parameter in the material to point to THAT file instead.<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">textures/common/mirror<br />{<br />   discrete      // never merge with other surfaces<br />   qer_editorimage textures/common/qer_mirror_editor.tga<br />   solid<br />   mirror<br />   {<br />      blend add<br />      map textures/common/qer_mirror.tga<br />   }<br />}</div>&#13;<br /><br />So now, everybody's happy. The material is happy because it DOESN'T find qer_mirror.tga and mirrors works perfectly in the game. And the map designer is happy because DoomEdit's Texture window DOES find and display the 64x64 symbolic <span style="font-weight: bold">qer_mirror_editor.tga</span> texture. Then I rebuilt a new PAK file and distributed it as Version 2.&#13;<br /><br />Mnemic:&#13;<br /><br />If you see the word Mirror in black letters on mirrors in the game, that's due to one of the following 3 possibilities:&#13;<br /><br />1. You're using Jafo's PAK instead of mine (some people may have these 2 confused). With all due respect and IMHO, nobody should use that PAK because there are many errors in it (119 to be exact, apart from the mirror thing).&#13;<br /><br />2. You're using Version 1 of my PAK since this problem was fixed in Version 2 (and later)&#13;<br /><br />3. You're using Version 2 or later but you have extracted the content of my PAK to your hard drive (against the specific recommendation in my <span style="font-weight: bold">readme</span> file to NOT extract the content of the PAK). By extracting, you overwrote the invisible.mtr file and extracted qer_mirror_editor.tga but qer_mirror.tga did NOT get deleted as it should have. Thus, the shader STILL finds the texture that it should not find and remains broken. By keeping stuff inside PAK files and simply using new PAK's, you avoid any possiblity of such a problem occuring.&#13;<br /><br />NOTE:&#13;<br />If you want to extract stuff to look at it, go ahead but don't extract it in the game's base folder! That's asking for trouble.</div>

I won't print the complete stats here since those are included in the zip file (along with a readme file). However, here's a quick overlook:<br /><br />66 materials commented out in Jafo's PAK were in fact good.<br />53 materials in Jafo's PAK were in fact broken.<br />These materials were uncommented/commented out accordingly.<br /><br />But the main difference lies in the fact tht this new PAK has 193 new TGA's to provide for qer_editorimages that were either missing or did not adequately depict what the texture really looks like in the game. Some of you who are currently designing maps in DoomEdit may think this PAK is just eye candy. If so, then consider these figures (compiled at the end of this project):<br /><br />//=========== Global textures/_ materials stats==============<br />// <br />// Total # of textures/_ materials : 3708 <br />// Total # of working shaders: 1950 (approx. 52.5%) <br />// Total # of Broken/CommentedOut shaders: 1614 (approx. 43.5%) <br />// Total # of shaders which can't be used for map texturing and kept by necessity: 144 (approx. 4%) <br />//==============================================<br /><br />Now I noticed that many of the materials in the original .mtr files can be misleading. Those may seem to be working but are really broken because the material code calls for a single non-existent TGA. The result is a texture that will display on your brush/patch in the game but won't look right (for eg. a material in which only the specularmap parameter refers to a TGA file that doesn't exist while the bump and diffuse map TGA's <span style="font-weight: bold">do</span> exist).<br /><br />That means there's a significant chance that you might unknowingly be using broken materials to texture your map's geometry. So this PAK not only improves the look and ease of use of DoomEdit's texture window, it also ensures that you use <span style="font-weight: bold">only</span> 100% working materials to texture your maps.<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320010639/http://www.pcgamemods.com/9082/" class="postlink">DoomEdit CleanMaterials Version 5</a><br />(approx 13MB download)<br /><br />Notes:<br />- Version 2 has fix for qer_mirror texture appearing on mirrors in game.<br />- Version 3 fixes the demon spawndecal not appearing in game.<br />- Version 4 adds the 6 new materials in the V1.1 game patch plus a cosmetic issue with the editorimage textures/editor/redge.tga. Please note that these new materials are not meant to be used for map texturing. They were added so that my PAK won't break the new chat and lag icons in the V1.1 patched game when playing in MP mode. That's the ONLY real change in the V4 CleanMats.<br />- Version 5 is the final cleanup phase. All the remaining materials have now been cleaned up (models, light, fog, fx's, gui's, particles, etc.). I also improved the qer_editorimage for model based entities in CAM view while in skinned mode. Most monsters/NPC's displayed their displacement map as the editorimage by default. Static models often used their addblend map by default (which made them appear pitch black). Most now use the _local bumpmap which improves visibility and clarity in skinned mode.<br /><br />- There are no new TGA files in this pak so it's the same size as the last version.<br /><br />A few broken materials for the sentry character reside in the sentry.def file so you need to download my latest Clean def's PAK to make this 100% complete. Please check the "Editing resources" sticky post in this forum for the URL of the "Clean def's" thread<br /><br />PS: Mods please update links in other posts to point to this one (if required).

I did not add any new shaders/materials in the mtr files. All I (and Jafo) did was to comment out the broken materials so they don't get parsed by the editor, that's all.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I guess all the preview images you created from scratch will not be the problem, since these are editor only.</div><br /><br />That's right. The TGA file that the qer_editorimage parameter points to affects only what you see in the editor's texture window and in the CAM view. It has no effect on the the material in the game itself.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">But did some of the shaders e.g. have to be changed to differ from the originals?</div>
<br /><br />Absolutely not. That would have been the worst thing to do and I made it a point to never do that. All the shaders' code were left intact and original. My goal was not to "repair" anything. My goal was simply to sort out which materials really work and which ones don't work. The ones that don't work were commented out, the ones that DO work were left untouched except for the qer_editorimage to improve how it looks in the Texture window. And that's all there is to it.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p51119" date="Posted: Fri Sep 17, 2004 4:48 pm "><author>Brain Trepaning</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks a lot, this will be very helpful for many mappers.

<br /><br />Is it true that the editor cannot mix unpacked with packed?  I ran into this same problem with .def files (I had D3 packed and it wasn't reading my custom .def files, which is what prompted me to unpack them in the first place).  Once I had unpacked the D3 files, my own def files read fine.  It seems like I've hit this issue again.
<br /><br />So bascially the question is, do I have to unpack the clean materials in my unpacked directory for them to read?

<br /><br />You're very welcome. About the textures/common/mirror material, I found the reason why. Here's the material code:
<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">textures/common/mirror<br />{<br />   discrete      // never merge with other surfaces<br />   qer_editorimage textures/common/qer_mirror.tga<br />   solid<br />   mirror<br />   {<br />      blend add<br />      map textures/common/qer_mirror.tga<br />   }<br />}</div>
<br /><br />The TGA file "textures/common/qer_mirror.tga" is not present in the original game's pak004.pk4 , therefore you don't get this problem in the original game. The problem with this material is that that TGA image is used as a blendmap in the original code. It's not the qer_editorimage that causes this but the blend add stage.
<br /><br />Incidentally, I didn't create this image, my predecessor did. But ultimately it's my fault. I didn't test the textures/common materials thoroughly enough assuming there couldn't be anything wrong about those since they're so simple and straighforward.
<br /><br />I will fix that by renaming the qer_mirror.tga to something else and edit the qer_editorimage line to point to the renamed image instead. I won't change the blend add stage of course - the idea is that it must NOT find the TGA file it points to. The shader probably needs a blend add stage pointing to an inexistent texture to work properly (at least that's what I'm guessing). In any case, I musn't change the original shader code, I have to work around it.
<br /><br />The only downside is that you will get a "warning: textures/common/qer_mirror.tga not found" message when you load the material in the editor. But you won't see a "mirror" texture in your compiled maps anymore.
<br /><br />Oh well.... that's why I gave that editing pack Version numbers. Thanks for pointing out the booboo Docgalad. I will test all the textures/common materials throroughly this time and post a Version 2 ASAP.
<br /><br />UPDATE:
<br /><br />I checked all the textures/common and textures/editor materials in a compiled map and they all work. I uploaded the fixed Version 2 and updated the link in the top post.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p51379" date="Posted: Sat Sep 18, 2004 10:52 am "><author>indianajonesilm</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">WOW!!!!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320010639im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br />I would just like to say THANK YOU to all involved in making this.

<br /><br />First off, notice how all of the paks have the prefix "ZZ-".
<br /><br />The reason for this is because the engine loads PK4 files alphabetically. Therefore, these PK4s will be loaded last.
<br /><br />Second, if you open the clean materials pak, you'll see that it contains a materials folder and within this folder are *.mtr files with the exact same names as the ones packaged with the game.
<br /><br />Now, each of these *.mtr files is pretty much an exact replica of the original file with one exception. The broken shaders are commented out.
<br /><br />The result is the stock mtr files loaded into memory are replaced with the modified versions. Hence, the broken shaders no longer show up because they've been commented out.
<br /><br />Now, the reason why this screws the game up is because when Eutectic created these paks, he added new content.
<br /><br />For instance, all of the material shaders that represent things like particle effects, ect... have been altered to illustrate that these textures are not intended to be applied to brushes.
<br /><br />So, the bottom line is that these paks are intended for use with the editor only. If you use it during gameplay, or during testing for that matter, things aren't going to work right.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p151982" date="Posted: Wed Aug 02, 2006 7:36 am "><author>Hemebond</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">rich_is_bored wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Now, the reason why this screws the game up is because when Eutectic created these paks, he added new content.<br /><br />For instance, all of the material shaders that represent things like particle effects, ect... have been altered to illustrate that these textures are not intended to be applied to brushes.</div>That's the part I didn't know.

The problem is, they forgot to take care of all the declarations they broke in the process.<br /><br />The clean paks attempt to fix this problem by overriding broken declarations and altering others to make the overall experience when working with the built-in tools more efficient. No new declarations are added so there's no need to be concerned about dependancies.<br /><br />So, should you be using the paks during gameplay? No, for the reasons mentioned above by Skul. Would doing so bring about the Apocalypse? No but it's a good idea to test your maps under the same conditions as your userbase.

They then stripped all the models etc that WASNT used in the GAME, this then broke other parts of the models leaving behind a nice mess for anyone who uses the editor to have to deal with.

<br /><br />Not in this case it isn't. I examined every single hit from this query and they all link to the old pcgamemods url, which is obviously out of date since the file isn't there. Actually, there's two or three distinct pcgamemods urls, but zero of them work -- all either give a 404 or a more obscure error message.
<br /><br />Looks like it was moved, and Google hasn't indexed any other location.
<br /><br />But never fear: my good friend Infernis over at Leveldesign.nl has a copy on a disk, and <span style="font-weight: bold">may</span> be able to host it. (I can't promise anything on his behalf though.)

<br /><br />First off, notice how all of the paks have the prefix "ZZ-".
<br /><br />The reason for this is because the engine loads PK4 files alphabetically. Therefore, these PK4s will be loaded last.
<br /><br />Second, if you open the clean materials pak, you'll see that it contains a materials folder and within this folder are *.mtr files with the exact same names as the ones packaged with the game.
<br /><br />Now, each of these *.mtr files is pretty much an exact replica of the original file with one exception. The broken shaders are commented out.
<br /><br />The result is the stock mtr files loaded into memory are replaced with the modified versions. Hence, the broken shaders no longer show up because they've been commented out.
<br /><br />Now, the reason why this screws the game up is because when Eutectic created these paks, he added new content.
<br /><br />For instance, all of the material shaders that represent things like particle effects, ect... have been altered to illustrate that these textures are not intended to be applied to brushes.
<br /><br />So, the bottom line is that these paks are intended for use with the editor only. If you use it during gameplay, or during testing for that matter, things aren't going to work right.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p151982" date="Posted: Wed Aug 02, 2006 6:36 am "><author>Hemebond</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">rich_is_bored wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Now, the reason why this screws the game up is because when Eutectic created these paks, he added new content.<br /><br />For instance, all of the material shaders that represent things like particle effects, ect... have been altered to illustrate that these textures are not intended to be applied to brushes.</div>That's the part I didn't know.

The problem is, they forgot to take care of all the declarations they broke in the process.<br /><br />The clean paks attempt to fix this problem by overriding broken declarations and altering others to make the overall experience when working with the built-in tools more efficient. No new declarations are added so there's no need to be concerned about dependancies.<br /><br />So, should you be using the paks during gameplay? No, for the reasons mentioned above by Skul. Would doing so bring about the Apocalypse? No but it's a good idea to test your maps under the same conditions as your userbase.

The reason for this is because the engine loads PK4 files alphabetically. Therefore, these PK4s will be loaded last.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Second, if you open the clean materials pak, you'll see that it contains a materials folder and within this folder are *.mtr files with the exact same names as the ones packaged with the game.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Now, each of these *.mtr files is pretty much an exact replica of the original file with one exception. The broken shaders are commented out.&#13;
<br/><br/>
The result is the stock mtr files loaded into memory are replaced with the modified versions. Hence, the broken shaders no longer show up because they've been commented out.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Now, the reason why this screws the game up is because when Eutectic created these paks, he added new content.&#13;
<br/><br/>
For instance, all of the material shaders that represent things like particle effects, ect... have been altered to illustrate that these textures are not intended to be applied to brushes.&#13;
<br/><br/>
So, the bottom line is that these paks are intended for use with the editor only. If you use it during gameplay, or during testing for that matter, things aren't going to work right.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/" target="_blank" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/site/img/d3w.gif" border="0"/>  Staff</a>&#13;

Something about a point being out of range, or similar).<br /><br />You don't need to worry about creating levels with them. The paks just let you see what the textures are in the editor.

The problem is, they forgot to take care of all the declarations they broke in the process.<br /><br />The clean paks attempt to fix this problem by overriding broken declarations and altering others to make the overall experience when working with the built-in tools more efficient. No new declarations are added so there's no need to be concerned about dependancies.<br /><br />So, should you be using the paks during gameplay? No, for the reasons mentioned above by Skul. Would doing so bring about the Apocalypse? No but it's a good idea to test your maps under the same conditions as your userbase. And most of them are probably not going to download and use the clean paks.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p192405" date="Posted: Mon Dec 10, 2007 11:40 am "><author>Dogstar</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks for the explanations, guys - much clearer about using those pak files now! <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8)" title="Cool" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p150999" date="Posted: Tue Jul 25, 2006 3:42 am "><author>rich_is_bored</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Wouldn't it be easier to just go through all the MTR files and check to see if the reference images exist?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p151021" date="Posted: Tue Jul 25, 2006 5:34 am "><author>kat</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I'm not too sure becasue all that would do is show you a 'broken' material rather than a 'dead' one - it's the difference between a material that's simple <span style="font-style: italic">not used</span> or one that's <span style="font-style: italic">not complete</span> both of which result in a useless material file&#13;<br /><br />The only way to comprehensively check them would be to cross reference all material paths in material files for the corrisponding materials referenced on brushwork, game entities and models, at least that way you *know* what has at least been used as opposed to what is broken (which doesn't inherantly mean it's not been used).</div>]]></body></post><post id="p151817" date="Posted: Mon Jul 31, 2006 7:58 pm "><author>ajm113</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Can you give us a new link to download it at?

<br/><br/>
First off, notice how all of the paks have the prefix "ZZ-".&#13;
<br/><br/>
The reason for this is because the engine loads PK4 files alphabetically. Therefore, these PK4s will be loaded last.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Second, if you open the clean materials pak, you'll see that it contains a materials folder and within this folder are *.mtr files with the exact same names as the ones packaged with the game.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Now, each of these *.mtr files is pretty much an exact replica of the original file with one exception. The broken shaders are commented out.&#13;
<br/><br/>
The result is the stock mtr files loaded into memory are replaced with the modified versions. Hence, the broken shaders no longer show up because they've been commented out.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Now, the reason why this screws the game up is because when Eutectic created these paks, he added new content.&#13;
<br/><br/>
For instance, all of the material shaders that represent things like particle effects, ect... have been altered to illustrate that these textures are not intended to be applied to brushes.&#13;
<br/><br/>
So, the bottom line is that these paks are intended for use with the editor only. If you use it during gameplay, or during testing for that matter, things aren't going to work right.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/" target="_blank" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/site/img/d3w.gif" border="0"/>  Staff</a>&#13;

<br /><br />First off, notice how all of the paks have the prefix "ZZ-".
<br /><br />The reason for this is because the engine loads PK4 files alphabetically. Therefore, these PK4s will be loaded last.
<br /><br />Second, if you open the clean materials pak, you'll see that it contains a materials folder and within this folder are *.mtr files with the exact same names as the ones packaged with the game.
<br /><br />Now, each of these *.mtr files is pretty much an exact replica of the original file with one exception. The broken shaders are commented out.
<br /><br />The result is the stock mtr files loaded into memory are replaced with the modified versions. Hence, the broken shaders no longer show up because they've been commented out.
<br /><br />Now, the reason why this screws the game up is because when Eutectic created these paks, he added new content.
<br /><br />For instance, all of the material shaders that represent things like particle effects, ect... have been altered to illustrate that these textures are not intended to be applied to brushes.
<br /><br />So, the bottom line is that these paks are intended for use with the editor only. If you use it during gameplay, or during testing for that matter, things aren't going to work right.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p151982" date="Posted: Wed Aug 02, 2006 6:36 am "><author>Hemebond</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">rich_is_bored wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Now, the reason why this screws the game up is because when Eutectic created these paks, he added new content.<br /><br />For instance, all of the material shaders that represent things like particle effects, ect... have been altered to illustrate that these textures are not intended to be applied to brushes.</div>That's the part I didn't know.

<br /><br />==============================
<br /><br />It's done.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />This is a follow-up of Jafo's d3weditor clean shaders/materials pk4 file which served as a starting base for this new PAK. I won't print the complete stats here since those are included in the zip file (along with a readme file). However, here's a quick overlook:
<br /><br />66 materials commented out in Jafo's PAK were in fact good.
<br />53 materials in Jafo's PAK were in fact broken.
<br />These materials were uncommented/commented out accordingly.
<br /><br />But the main difference lies in the fact tht this new PAK has 193 new TGA's to provide for qer_editorimages that were either missing or did not adequately depict what the texture really looks like in the game. Some of you who are currently designing maps in DoomEdit may think this PAK is just eye candy. If so, then consider these figures (compiled at the end of this project):
<br /><br />//=========== Global textures/_ materials stats==============
<br />// 
<br />// Total # of textures/_ materials : 3708 
<br />// Total # of working shaders: 1950 (approx. 52.5%) 
<br />// Total # of Broken/CommentedOut shaders: 1614 (approx. 43.5%) 
<br />// Total # of shaders which can't be used for map texturing and kept by necessity: 144 (approx. 4%) 
<br />//==============================================
<br /><br />Now I noticed that many of the materials in the original .mtr files can be misleading. Those may seem to be working but are really broken because the material code calls for a single non-existent TGA. The result is a texture that will display on your brush/patch in the game but won't look right (for eg. a material in which only the specularmap parameter refers to a TGA file that doesn't exist while the bump and diffuse map TGA's <span style="font-weight: bold">do</span> exist).
<br /><br />That means there's a significant chance that you might unknowingly be using broken materials to texture your map's geometry. So this PAK not only improves the look and ease of use of DoomEdit's texture window, it also ensures that you use <span style="font-weight: bold">only</span> 100% working materials to texture your maps.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.pcgamemods.com/9082/" class="postlink">DoomEdit CleanMaterials Version 5</a>
<br />(approx 13MB download)
<br /><br />Notes:
<br />- Version 2 has fix for qer_mirror texture appearing on mirrors in game.
<br />- Version 3 fixes the demon spawndecal not appearing in game.
<br />- Version 4 adds the 6 new materials in the V1.1 game patch plus a cosmetic issue with the editorimage textures/editor/redge.tga. Please note that these new materials are not meant to be used for map texturing. They were added so that my PAK won't break the new chat and lag icons in the V1.1 patched game when playing in MP mode. That's the ONLY real change in the V4 CleanMats.
<br />- Version 5 is the final cleanup phase. All the remaining materials have now been cleaned up (models, light, fog, fx's, gui's, particles, etc.). I also improved the qer_editorimage for model based entities in CAM view while in skinned mode. Most monsters/NPC's displayed their displacement map as the editorimage by default. Static models often used their addblend map by default (which made them appear pitch black). Most now use the _local bumpmap which improves visibility and clarity in skinned mode.
<br /><br />- There are no new TGA files in this pak so it's the same size as the last version.
<br /><br />A few broken materials for the sentry character reside in the sentry.def file so you need to download my latest Clean def's PAK to make this 100% complete. Please check the "Editing resources" sticky post in this forum for the URL of the "Clean def's" thread
<br /><br />PS: Mods please update links in other posts to point to this one (if required). Thanks.

All I (and Jafo) did was to comment out the broken materials so they don't get parsed by the editor, that's all.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I guess all the preview images you created from scratch will not be the problem, since these are editor only.</div><br /><br />That's right.

<br /><br />Absolutely not. That would have been the worst thing to do and I made it a point to never do that. All the shaders' code were left intact and original. My goal was not to "repair" anything. My goal was simply to sort out which materials really work and which ones don't work. The ones that don't work were commented out, the ones that DO work were left untouched except for the qer_editorimage to improve how it looks in the Texture window. And that's all there is to it.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p51119" date="Posted: Fri Sep 17, 2004 3:48 pm "><author>Brain Trepaning</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks a lot, this will be very helpful for many mappers.

Once I had unpacked the D3 files, my own def files read fine.  It seems like I've hit this issue again.

<br /><br />You're very welcome. About the textures/common/mirror material, I found the reason why. Here's the material code:
<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">textures/common/mirror<br />{<br />   discrete      // never merge with other surfaces<br />   qer_editorimage textures/common/qer_mirror.tga<br />   solid<br />   mirror<br />   {<br />      blend add<br />      map textures/common/qer_mirror.tga<br />   }<br />}</div>
<br /><br />The TGA file "textures/common/qer_mirror.tga" is not present in the original game's pak004.pk4 , therefore you don't get this problem in the original game. The problem with this material is that that TGA image is used as a blendmap in the original code. It's not the qer_editorimage that causes this but the blend add stage.
<br /><br />Incidentally, I didn't create this image, my predecessor did. But ultimately it's my fault. I didn't test the textures/common materials thoroughly enough assuming there couldn't be anything wrong about those since they're so simple and straighforward.
<br /><br />I will fix that by renaming the qer_mirror.tga to something else and edit the qer_editorimage line to point to the renamed image instead. I won't change the blend add stage of course - the idea is that it must NOT find the TGA file it points to. The shader probably needs a blend add stage pointing to an inexistent texture to work properly (at least that's what I'm guessing). In any case, I musn't change the original shader code, I have to work around it.
<br /><br />The only downside is that you will get a "warning: textures/common/qer_mirror.tga not found" message when you load the material in the editor. But you won't see a "mirror" texture in your compiled maps anymore.
<br /><br />Oh well.... that's why I gave that editing pack Version numbers. Thanks for pointing out the booboo Docgalad. I will test all the textures/common materials throroughly this time and post a Version 2 ASAP.
<br /><br />UPDATE:
<br /><br />I checked all the textures/common and textures/editor materials in a compiled map and they all work. I uploaded the fixed Version 2 and updated the link in the top post.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p51379" date="Posted: Sat Sep 18, 2004 9:52 am "><author>indianajonesilm</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">WOW!!!!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilie" /><!--

<br />53 materials in Jafo's PAK were in fact broken.
<br />These materials were uncommented/commented out accordingly.
<br /><br />But the main difference lies in the fact tht this new PAK has 193 new TGA's to provide for qer_editorimages that were either missing or did not adequately depict what the texture really looks like in the game. Some of you who are currently designing maps in DoomEdit may think this PAK is just eye candy. If so, then consider these figures (compiled at the end of this project):
<br /><br />//=========== Global textures/_ materials stats==============
<br />// 
<br />// Total # of textures/_ materials : 3708 
<br />// Total # of working shaders: 1950 (approx. 52.5%) 
<br />// Total # of Broken/CommentedOut shaders: 1614 (approx. 43.5%) 
<br />// Total # of shaders which can't be used for map texturing and kept by necessity: 144 (approx. 4%) 
<br />//==============================================
<br /><br />Now I noticed that many of the materials in the original .mtr files can be misleading. Those may seem to be working but are really broken because the material code calls for a single non-existent TGA. The result is a texture that will display on your brush/patch in the game but won't look right (for eg. a material in which only the specularmap parameter refers to a TGA file that doesn't exist while the bump and diffuse map TGA's <span style="font-weight: bold">do</span> exist).
<br /><br />That means there's a significant chance that you might unknowingly be using broken materials to texture your map's geometry. So this PAK not only improves the look and ease of use of DoomEdit's texture window, it also ensures that you use <span style="font-weight: bold">only</span> 100% working materials to texture your maps.

<br />(approx 13MB download)
<br /><br />Notes:
<br />- Version 2 has fix for qer_mirror texture appearing on mirrors in game.
<br />- Version 3 fixes the demon spawndecal not appearing in game.
<br />- Version 4 adds the 6 new materials in the V1.1 game patch plus a cosmetic issue with the editorimage textures/editor/redge.tga. Please note that these new materials are not meant to be used for map texturing. They were added so that my PAK won't break the new chat and lag icons in the V1.1 patched game when playing in MP mode. That's the ONLY real change in the V4 CleanMats.
<br />- Version 5 is the final cleanup phase. All the remaining materials have now been cleaned up (models, light, fog, fx's, gui's, particles, etc.). I also improved the qer_editorimage for model based entities in CAM view while in skinned mode. Most monsters/NPC's displayed their displacement map as the editorimage by default. Static models often used their addblend map by default (which made them appear pitch black). Most now use the _local bumpmap which improves visibility and clarity in skinned mode.
<br /><br />- There are no new TGA files in this pak so it's the same size as the last version.
<br /><br />A few broken materials for the sentry character reside in the sentry.def file so you need to download my latest Clean def's PAK to make this 100% complete. Please check the "Editing resources" sticky post in this forum for the URL of the "Clean def's" thread
<br /><br />PS: Mods please update links in other posts to point to this one (if required). Thanks.

<br /><br />Absolutely not. That would have been the worst thing to do and I made it a point to never do that. All the shaders' code were left intact and original. My goal was not to "repair" anything. My goal was simply to sort out which materials really work and which ones don't work. The ones that don't work were commented out, the ones that DO work were left untouched except for the qer_editorimage to improve how it looks in the Texture window.

<br /><br />You're very welcome. About the textures/common/mirror material, I found the reason why. Here's the material code:
<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">textures/common/mirror<br />{<br />   discrete      // never merge with other surfaces<br />   qer_editorimage textures/common/qer_mirror.tga<br />   solid<br />   mirror<br />   {<br />      blend add<br />      map textures/common/qer_mirror.tga<br />   }<br />}</div>
<br /><br />The TGA file "textures/common/qer_mirror.tga" is not present in the original game's pak004.pk4 , therefore you don't get this problem in the original game. The problem with this material is that that TGA image is used as a blendmap in the original code. It's not the qer_editorimage that causes this but the blend add stage.
<br /><br />Incidentally, I didn't create this image, my predecessor did. But ultimately it's my fault. I didn't test the textures/common materials thoroughly enough assuming there couldn't be anything wrong about those since they're so simple and straighforward.
<br /><br />I will fix that by renaming the qer_mirror.tga to something else and edit the qer_editorimage line to point to the renamed image instead. I won't change the blend add stage of course - the idea is that it must NOT find the TGA file it points to. The shader probably needs a blend add stage pointing to an inexistent texture to work properly (at least that's what I'm guessing). In any case, I musn't change the original shader code, I have to work around it.
<br /><br />The only downside is that you will get a "warning: textures/common/qer_mirror.tga not found" message when you load the material in the editor. But you won't see a "mirror" texture in your compiled maps anymore.
<br /><br />Oh well.... that's why I gave that editing pack Version numbers. Thanks for pointing out the booboo Docgalad. I will test all the textures/common materials throroughly this time and post a Version 2 ASAP.
<br /><br />UPDATE:
<br /><br />I checked all the textures/common and textures/editor materials in a compiled map and they all work. I uploaded the fixed Version 2 and updated the link in the top post.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p51379" date="Posted: Sat Sep 18, 2004 9:52 am "><author>indianajonesilm</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">WOW!!!!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilie" /><!--

<br /><br />You're very welcome. About the textures/common/mirror material, I found the reason why. Here's the material code:
<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">textures/common/mirror<br />{<br />   discrete      // never merge with other surfaces<br />   qer_editorimage textures/common/qer_mirror.tga<br />   solid<br />   mirror<br />   {<br />      blend add<br />      map textures/common/qer_mirror.tga<br />   }<br />}</div>
<br /><br />The TGA file "textures/common/qer_mirror.tga" is not present in the original game's pak004.pk4 , therefore you don't get this problem in the original game. The problem with this material is that that TGA image is used as a blendmap in the original code. It's not the qer_editorimage that causes this but the blend add stage.
<br /><br />Incidentally, I didn't create this image, my predecessor did. But ultimately it's my fault. I didn't test the textures/common materials thoroughly enough assuming there couldn't be anything wrong about those since they're so simple and straighforward.
<br /><br />I will fix that by renaming the qer_mirror.tga to something else and edit the qer_editorimage line to point to the renamed image instead. I won't change the blend add stage of course - the idea is that it must NOT find the TGA file it points to. The shader probably needs a blend add stage pointing to an inexistent texture to work properly (at least that's what I'm guessing). In any case, I musn't change the original shader code, I have to work around it.
<br /><br />The only downside is that you will get a "warning: textures/common/qer_mirror.tga not found" message when you load the material in the editor. But you won't see a "mirror" texture in your compiled maps anymore.
<br /><br />Oh well.... that's why I gave that editing pack Version numbers. Thanks for pointing out the booboo Docgalad. I will test all the textures/common materials throroughly this time and post a Version 2 ASAP.
<br /><br />UPDATE:
<br /><br />I checked all the textures/common and textures/editor materials in a compiled map and they all work. I uploaded the fixed Version 2 and updated the link in the top post.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p51379" date="Posted: Sat Sep 18, 2004 9:52 am "><author>indianajonesilm</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">WOW!!!!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilie" /><!--

<br /><br />==============================
<br /><br />It's done.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />This is a follow-up of Jafo's d3weditor clean shaders/materials pk4 file which served as a starting base for this new PAK. I won't print the complete stats here since those are included in the zip file (along with a readme file). However, here's a quick overlook:
<br /><br />66 materials commented out in Jafo's PAK were in fact good.
<br />53 materials in Jafo's PAK were in fact broken.
<br />These materials were uncommented/commented out accordingly.
<br /><br />But the main difference lies in the fact tht this new PAK has 193 new TGA's to provide for qer_editorimages that were either missing or did not adequately depict what the texture really looks like in the game. Some of you who are currently designing maps in DoomEdit may think this PAK is just eye candy. If so, then consider these figures (compiled at the end of this project):
<br /><br />//=========== Global textures/_ materials stats==============
<br />// 
<br />// Total # of textures/_ materials : 3708 
<br />// Total # of working shaders: 1950 (approx. 52.5%) 
<br />// Total # of Broken/CommentedOut shaders: 1614 (approx. 43.5%) 
<br />// Total # of shaders which can't be used for map texturing and kept by necessity: 144 (approx. 4%) 
<br />//==============================================
<br /><br />Now I noticed that many of the materials in the original .mtr files can be misleading. Those may seem to be working but are really broken because the material code calls for a single non-existent TGA. The result is a texture that will display on your brush/patch in the game but won't look right (for eg. a material in which only the specularmap parameter refers to a TGA file that doesn't exist while the bump and diffuse map TGA's <span style="font-weight: bold">do</span> exist).
<br /><br />That means there's a significant chance that you might unknowingly be using broken materials to texture your map's geometry. So this PAK not only improves the look and ease of use of DoomEdit's texture window, it also ensures that you use <span style="font-weight: bold">only</span> 100% working materials to texture your maps.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.pcgamemods.com/9082/" class="postlink">DoomEdit CleanMaterials Version 5</a>
<br />(approx 13MB download)
<br /><br />Notes:
<br />- Version 2 has fix for qer_mirror texture appearing on mirrors in game.
<br />- Version 3 fixes the demon spawndecal not appearing in game.
<br />- Version 4 adds the 6 new materials in the V1.1 game patch plus a cosmetic issue with the editorimage textures/editor/redge.tga. Please note that these new materials are not meant to be used for map texturing. They were added so that my PAK won't break the new chat and lag icons in the V1.1 patched game when playing in MP mode. That's the ONLY real change in the V4 CleanMats.
<br />- Version 5 is the final cleanup phase. All the remaining materials have now been cleaned up (models, light, fog, fx's, gui's, particles, etc.). I also improved the qer_editorimage for model based entities in CAM view while in skinned mode. Most monsters/NPC's displayed their displacement map as the editorimage by default. Static models often used their addblend map by default (which made them appear pitch black). Most now use the _local bumpmap which improves visibility and clarity in skinned mode.
<br /><br />- There are no new TGA files in this pak so it's the same size as the last version.
<br /><br />A few broken materials for the sentry character reside in the sentry.def file so you need to download my latest Clean def's PAK to make this 100% complete. Please check the "Editing resources" sticky post in this forum for the URL of the "Clean def's" thread
<br /><br />PS: Mods please update links in other posts to point to this one (if required). Thanks.

I did not add any new shaders/materials in the mtr files. All I (and Jafo) did was to comment out the broken materials so they don't get parsed by the editor, that's all.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I guess all the preview images you created from scratch will not be the problem, since these are editor only.</div><br /><br />That's right. The TGA file that the qer_editorimage parameter points to affects only what you see in the editor's texture window and in the CAM view. It has no effect on the the material in the game itself.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">But did some of the shaders e.g. have to be changed to differ from the originals?</div>
<br /><br />Absolutely not. That would have been the worst thing to do and I made it a point to never do that. All the shaders' code were left intact and original. My goal was not to "repair" anything. My goal was simply to sort out which materials really work and which ones don't work. The ones that don't work were commented out, the ones that DO work were left untouched except for the qer_editorimage to improve how it looks in the Texture window. And that's all there is to it.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p51119" date="Posted: Fri Sep 17, 2004 3:48 pm "><author>Brain Trepaning</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks a lot, this will be very helpful for many mappers.

They were added so that my PAK won't break the new chat and lag icons in the V1.1 patched game when playing in MP mode. That's the ONLY real change in the V4 CleanMats.
<br />- Version 5 is the final cleanup phase. All the remaining materials have now been cleaned up (models, light, fog, fx's, gui's, particles, etc.). I also improved the qer_editorimage for model based entities in CAM view while in skinned mode. Most monsters/NPC's displayed their displacement map as the editorimage by default. Static models often used their addblend map by default (which made them appear pitch black). Most now use the _local bumpmap which improves visibility and clarity in skinned mode.
<br /><br />- There are no new TGA files in this pak so it's the same size as the last version.
<br /><br />A few broken materials for the sentry character reside in the sentry.def file so you need to download my latest Clean def's PAK to make this 100% complete. Please check the "Editing resources" sticky post in this forum for the URL of the "Clean def's" thread
<br /><br />PS: Mods please update links in other posts to point to this one (if required). Thanks.

<br /><br />Absolutely not. That would have been the worst thing to do and I made it a point to never do that. All the shaders' code were left intact and original. My goal was not to "repair" anything. My goal was simply to sort out which materials really work and which ones don't work. The ones that don't work were commented out, the ones that DO work were left untouched except for the qer_editorimage to improve how it looks in the Texture window.

<br /><br />You're very welcome. About the textures/common/mirror material, I found the reason why. Here's the material code:
<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">textures/common/mirror<br />{<br />   discrete      // never merge with other surfaces<br />   qer_editorimage textures/common/qer_mirror.tga<br />   solid<br />   mirror<br />   {<br />      blend add<br />      map textures/common/qer_mirror.tga<br />   }<br />}</div>
<br /><br />The TGA file "textures/common/qer_mirror.tga" is not present in the original game's pak004.pk4 , therefore you don't get this problem in the original game. The problem with this material is that that TGA image is used as a blendmap in the original code. It's not the qer_editorimage that causes this but the blend add stage.
<br /><br />Incidentally, I didn't create this image, my predecessor did. But ultimately it's my fault. I didn't test the textures/common materials thoroughly enough assuming there couldn't be anything wrong about those since they're so simple and straighforward.
<br /><br />I will fix that by renaming the qer_mirror.tga to something else and edit the qer_editorimage line to point to the renamed image instead. I won't change the blend add stage of course - the idea is that it must NOT find the TGA file it points to. The shader probably needs a blend add stage pointing to an inexistent texture to work properly (at least that's what I'm guessing). In any case, I musn't change the original shader code, I have to work around it.
<br /><br />The only downside is that you will get a "warning: textures/common/qer_mirror.tga not found" message when you load the material in the editor. But you won't see a "mirror" texture in your compiled maps anymore.
<br /><br />Oh well.... that's why I gave that editing pack Version numbers. Thanks for pointing out the booboo Docgalad. I will test all the textures/common materials throroughly this time and post a Version 2 ASAP.
<br /><br />UPDATE:
<br /><br />I checked all the textures/common and textures/editor materials in a compiled map and they all work. I uploaded the fixed Version 2 and updated the link in the top post.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p51379" date="Posted: Sat Sep 18, 2004 9:52 am "><author>indianajonesilm</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">WOW!!!!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilie" /><!--

<br /><br />==============================
<br /><br />It's done.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />This is a follow-up of Jafo's d3weditor clean shaders/materials pk4 file which served as a starting base for this new PAK. I won't print the complete stats here since those are included in the zip file (along with a readme file). However, here's a quick overlook:
<br /><br />66 materials commented out in Jafo's PAK were in fact good.
<br />53 materials in Jafo's PAK were in fact broken.
<br />These materials were uncommented/commented out accordingly.
<br /><br />But the main difference lies in the fact tht this new PAK has 193 new TGA's to provide for qer_editorimages that were either missing or did not adequately depict what the texture really looks like in the game. Some of you who are currently designing maps in DoomEdit may think this PAK is just eye candy. If so, then consider these figures (compiled at the end of this project):
<br /><br />//=========== Global textures/_ materials stats==============
<br />// 
<br />// Total # of textures/_ materials : 3708 
<br />// Total # of working shaders: 1950 (approx. 52.5%) 
<br />// Total # of Broken/CommentedOut shaders: 1614 (approx. 43.5%) 
<br />// Total # of shaders which can't be used for map texturing and kept by necessity: 144 (approx. 4%) 
<br />//==============================================
<br /><br />Now I noticed that many of the materials in the original .mtr files can be misleading. Those may seem to be working but are really broken because the material code calls for a single non-existent TGA. The result is a texture that will display on your brush/patch in the game but won't look right (for eg. a material in which only the specularmap parameter refers to a TGA file that doesn't exist while the bump and diffuse map TGA's <span style="font-weight: bold">do</span> exist).
<br /><br />That means there's a significant chance that you might unknowingly be using broken materials to texture your map's geometry. So this PAK not only improves the look and ease of use of DoomEdit's texture window, it also ensures that you use <span style="font-weight: bold">only</span> 100% working materials to texture your maps.

<br />(approx 13MB download)
<br /><br />Notes:
<br />- Version 2 has fix for qer_mirror texture appearing on mirrors in game.
<br />- Version 3 fixes the demon spawndecal not appearing in game.
<br />- Version 4 adds the 6 new materials in the V1.1 game patch plus a cosmetic issue with the editorimage textures/editor/redge.tga. Please note that these new materials are not meant to be used for map texturing. They were added so that my PAK won't break the new chat and lag icons in the V1.1 patched game when playing in MP mode. That's the ONLY real change in the V4 CleanMats.

<br /><br />- There are no new TGA files in this pak so it's the same size as the last version.

<br /><br />You're very welcome. About the textures/common/mirror material, I found the reason why. Here's the material code:
<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">textures/common/mirror<br />{<br />   discrete      // never merge with other surfaces<br />   qer_editorimage textures/common/qer_mirror.tga<br />   solid<br />   mirror<br />   {<br />      blend add<br />      map textures/common/qer_mirror.tga<br />   }<br />}</div>
<br /><br />The TGA file "textures/common/qer_mirror.tga" is not present in the original game's pak004.pk4 , therefore you don't get this problem in the original game. The problem with this material is that that TGA image is used as a blendmap in the original code. It's not the qer_editorimage that causes this but the blend add stage.
<br /><br />Incidentally, I didn't create this image, my predecessor did. But ultimately it's my fault. I didn't test the textures/common materials thoroughly enough assuming there couldn't be anything wrong about those since they're so simple and straighforward.
<br /><br />I will fix that by renaming the qer_mirror.tga to something else and edit the qer_editorimage line to point to the renamed image instead. I won't change the blend add stage of course - the idea is that it must NOT find the TGA file it points to. The shader probably needs a blend add stage pointing to an inexistent texture to work properly (at least that's what I'm guessing). In any case, I musn't change the original shader code, I have to work around it.
<br /><br />The only downside is that you will get a "warning: textures/common/qer_mirror.tga not found" message when you load the material in the editor. But you won't see a "mirror" texture in your compiled maps anymore.
<br /><br />Oh well.... that's why I gave that editing pack Version numbers. Thanks for pointing out the booboo Docgalad. I will test all the textures/common materials throroughly this time and post a Version 2 ASAP.
<br /><br />UPDATE:
<br /><br />I checked all the textures/common and textures/editor materials in a compiled map and they all work. I uploaded the fixed Version 2 and updated the link in the top post.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p51379" date="Posted: Sat Sep 18, 2004 9:52 am "><author>indianajonesilm</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">WOW!!!!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilie" /><!--

<br /><br />==============================
<br /><br />It's done.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />This is a follow-up of Jafo's d3weditor clean shaders/materials pk4 file which served as a starting base for this new PAK. I won't print the complete stats here since those are included in the zip file (along with a readme file). However, here's a quick overlook:
<br /><br />66 materials commented out in Jafo's PAK were in fact good.
<br />53 materials in Jafo's PAK were in fact broken.
<br />These materials were uncommented/commented out accordingly.
<br /><br />But the main difference lies in the fact tht this new PAK has 193 new TGA's to provide for qer_editorimages that were either missing or did not adequately depict what the texture really looks like in the game. Some of you who are currently designing maps in DoomEdit may think this PAK is just eye candy. If so, then consider these figures (compiled at the end of this project):
<br /><br />//=========== Global textures/_ materials stats==============
<br />// 
<br />// Total # of textures/_ materials : 3708 
<br />// Total # of working shaders: 1950 (approx. 52.5%) 
<br />// Total # of Broken/CommentedOut shaders: 1614 (approx. 43.5%) 
<br />// Total # of shaders which can't be used for map texturing and kept by necessity: 144 (approx. 4%) 
<br />//==============================================
<br /><br />Now I noticed that many of the materials in the original .mtr files can be misleading. Those may seem to be working but are really broken because the material code calls for a single non-existent TGA. The result is a texture that will display on your brush/patch in the game but won't look right (for eg. a material in which only the specularmap parameter refers to a TGA file that doesn't exist while the bump and diffuse map TGA's <span style="font-weight: bold">do</span> exist).
<br /><br />That means there's a significant chance that you might unknowingly be using broken materials to texture your map's geometry. So this PAK not only improves the look and ease of use of DoomEdit's texture window, it also ensures that you use <span style="font-weight: bold">only</span> 100% working materials to texture your maps.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.pcgamemods.com/9082/" class="postlink">DoomEdit CleanMaterials Version 5</a>
<br />(approx 13MB download)
<br /><br />Notes:
<br />- Version 2 has fix for qer_mirror texture appearing on mirrors in game.
<br />- Version 3 fixes the demon spawndecal not appearing in game.
<br />- Version 4 adds the 6 new materials in the V1.1 game patch plus a cosmetic issue with the editorimage textures/editor/redge.tga. Please note that these new materials are not meant to be used for map texturing. They were added so that my PAK won't break the new chat and lag icons in the V1.1 patched game when playing in MP mode. That's the ONLY real change in the V4 CleanMats.
<br />- Version 5 is the final cleanup phase. All the remaining materials have now been cleaned up (models, light, fog, fx's, gui's, particles, etc.). I also improved the qer_editorimage for model based entities in CAM view while in skinned mode. Most monsters/NPC's displayed their displacement map as the editorimage by default. Static models often used their addblend map by default (which made them appear pitch black). Most now use the _local bumpmap which improves visibility and clarity in skinned mode.
<br /><br />- There are no new TGA files in this pak so it's the same size as the last version.
<br /><br />A few broken materials for the sentry character reside in the sentry.def file so you need to download my latest Clean def's PAK to make this 100% complete. Please check the "Editing resources" sticky post in this forum for the URL of the "Clean def's" thread

<br /><br />One thing I have been wondering is this. 
<br /><br />How will maps using this pack work on a clean (non-development) install of D3. In Q3A there where several special textures provided with GTKradiant editing, that where not part of the clean retail install, thus missing on those machines.

I did not add any new shaders/materials in the mtr files. All I (and Jafo) did was to comment out the broken materials so they don't get parsed by the editor, that's all.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I guess all the preview images you created from scratch will not be the problem, since these are editor only.</div><br /><br />That's right. The TGA file that the qer_editorimage parameter points to affects only what you see in the editor's texture window and in the CAM view. It has no effect on the the material in the game itself.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">But did some of the shaders e.g. have to be changed to differ from the originals?</div>
<br /><br />Absolutely not. That would have been the worst thing to do and I made it a point to never do that. All the shaders' code were left intact and original. My goal was not to "repair" anything. My goal was simply to sort out which materials really work and which ones don't work. The ones that don't work were commented out, the ones that DO work were left untouched except for the qer_editorimage to improve how it looks in the Texture window. And that's all there is to it.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p51119" date="Posted: Fri Sep 17, 2004 3:48 pm "><author>Brain Trepaning</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks a lot, this will be very helpful for many mappers.

<br /><br />I have D3 completely unpacked for mapping purposes.  I downloaded the pk4 and put it into base, but the editor is not reading it.
<br /><br />Is it true that the editor cannot mix unpacked with packed?  I ran into this same problem with .def files (I had D3 packed and it wasn't reading my custom .def files, which is what prompted me to unpack them in the first place).  Once I had unpacked the D3 files, my own def files read fine.  It seems like I've hit this issue again.
<br /><br />So bascially the question is, do I have to unpack the clean materials in my unpacked directory for them to read?

<br /><br />Absolutely not. That would have been the worst thing to do and I made it a point to never do that. All the shaders' code were left intact and original. My goal was not to "repair" anything. My goal was simply to sort out which materials really work and which ones don't work. The ones that don't work were commented out, the ones that DO work were left untouched except for the qer_editorimage to improve how it looks in the Texture window. And that's all there is to it.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p51119" date="Posted: Fri Sep 17, 2004 3:48 pm "><author>Brain Trepaning</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks a lot, this will be very helpful for many mappers.

<br /><br />You're very welcome. About the textures/common/mirror material, I found the reason why. Here's the material code:
<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">textures/common/mirror<br />{<br />   discrete      // never merge with other surfaces<br />   qer_editorimage textures/common/qer_mirror.tga<br />   solid<br />   mirror<br />   {<br />      blend add<br />      map textures/common/qer_mirror.tga<br />   }<br />}</div>
<br /><br />The TGA file "textures/common/qer_mirror.tga" is not present in the original game's pak004.pk4 , therefore you don't get this problem in the original game. The problem with this material is that that TGA image is used as a blendmap in the original code. It's not the qer_editorimage that causes this but the blend add stage.
<br /><br />Incidentally, I didn't create this image, my predecessor did. But ultimately it's my fault. I didn't test the textures/common materials thoroughly enough assuming there couldn't be anything wrong about those since they're so simple and straighforward.
<br /><br />I will fix that by renaming the qer_mirror.tga to something else and edit the qer_editorimage line to point to the renamed image instead. I won't change the blend add stage of course - the idea is that it must NOT find the TGA file it points to. The shader probably needs a blend add stage pointing to an inexistent texture to work properly (at least that's what I'm guessing). In any case, I musn't change the original shader code, I have to work around it.
<br /><br />The only downside is that you will get a "warning: textures/common/qer_mirror.tga not found" message when you load the material in the editor. But you won't see a "mirror" texture in your compiled maps anymore.
<br /><br />Oh well.... that's why I gave that editing pack Version numbers. Thanks for pointing out the booboo Docgalad. I will test all the textures/common materials throroughly this time and post a Version 2 ASAP.
<br /><br />UPDATE:
<br /><br />I checked all the textures/common and textures/editor materials in a compiled map and they all work. I uploaded the fixed Version 2 and updated the link in the top post.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p51379" date="Posted: Sat Sep 18, 2004 9:52 am "><author>indianajonesilm</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">WOW!!!!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilie" /><!--

<br /><br />==============================
<br /><br />It's done.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />This is a follow-up of Jafo's d3weditor clean shaders/materials pk4 file which served as a starting base for this new PAK. I won't print the complete stats here since those are included in the zip file (along with a readme file). However, here's a quick overlook:
<br /><br />66 materials commented out in Jafo's PAK were in fact good.
<br />53 materials in Jafo's PAK were in fact broken.
<br />These materials were uncommented/commented out accordingly.
<br /><br />But the main difference lies in the fact tht this new PAK has 193 new TGA's to provide for qer_editorimages that were either missing or did not adequately depict what the texture really looks like in the game. Some of you who are currently designing maps in DoomEdit may think this PAK is just eye candy. If so, then consider these figures (compiled at the end of this project):
<br /><br />//=========== Global textures/_ materials stats==============
<br />// 
<br />// Total # of textures/_ materials : 3708 
<br />// Total # of working shaders: 1950 (approx. 52.5%) 
<br />// Total # of Broken/CommentedOut shaders: 1614 (approx. 43.5%) 
<br />// Total # of shaders which can't be used for map texturing and kept by necessity: 144 (approx. 4%) 
<br />//==============================================
<br /><br />Now I noticed that many of the materials in the original .mtr files can be misleading. Those may seem to be working but are really broken because the material code calls for a single non-existent TGA. The result is a texture that will display on your brush/patch in the game but won't look right (for eg. a material in which only the specularmap parameter refers to a TGA file that doesn't exist while the bump and diffuse map TGA's <span style="font-weight: bold">do</span> exist).
<br /><br />That means there's a significant chance that you might unknowingly be using broken materials to texture your map's geometry. So this PAK not only improves the look and ease of use of DoomEdit's texture window, it also ensures that you use <span style="font-weight: bold">only</span> 100% working materials to texture your maps.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.pcgamemods.com/9082/" class="postlink">DoomEdit CleanMaterials Version 5</a>
<br />(approx 13MB download)
<br /><br />Notes:
<br />- Version 2 has fix for qer_mirror texture appearing on mirrors in game.
<br />- Version 3 fixes the demon spawndecal not appearing in game.
<br />- Version 4 adds the 6 new materials in the V1.1 game patch plus a cosmetic issue with the editorimage textures/editor/redge.tga. Please note that these new materials are not meant to be used for map texturing. They were added so that my PAK won't break the new chat and lag icons in the V1.1 patched game when playing in MP mode. That's the ONLY real change in the V4 CleanMats.
<br />- Version 5 is the final cleanup phase. All the remaining materials have now been cleaned up (models, light, fog, fx's, gui's, particles, etc.). I also improved the qer_editorimage for model based entities in CAM view while in skinned mode. Most monsters/NPC's displayed their displacement map as the editorimage by default. Static models often used their addblend map by default (which made them appear pitch black). Most now use the _local bumpmap which improves visibility and clarity in skinned mode.
<br /><br />- There are no new TGA files in this pak so it's the same size as the last version.
<br /><br />A few broken materials for the sentry character reside in the sentry.def file so you need to download my latest Clean def's PAK to make this 100% complete. Please check the "Editing resources" sticky post in this forum for the URL of the "Clean def's" thread

<br /><br />You're very welcome. About the textures/common/mirror material, I found the reason why. Here's the material code:
<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">textures/common/mirror<br />{<br />   discrete      // never merge with other surfaces<br />   qer_editorimage textures/common/qer_mirror.tga<br />   solid<br />   mirror<br />   {<br />      blend add<br />      map textures/common/qer_mirror.tga<br />   }<br />}</div>
<br /><br />The TGA file "textures/common/qer_mirror.tga" is not present in the original game's pak004.pk4 , therefore you don't get this problem in the original game. The problem with this material is that that TGA image is used as a blendmap in the original code. It's not the qer_editorimage that causes this but the blend add stage.
<br /><br />Incidentally, I didn't create this image, my predecessor did. But ultimately it's my fault. I didn't test the textures/common materials thoroughly enough assuming there couldn't be anything wrong about those since they're so simple and straighforward.
<br /><br />I will fix that by renaming the qer_mirror.tga to something else and edit the qer_editorimage line to point to the renamed image instead. I won't change the blend add stage of course - the idea is that it must NOT find the TGA file it points to. The shader probably needs a blend add stage pointing to an inexistent texture to work properly (at least that's what I'm guessing). In any case, I musn't change the original shader code, I have to work around it.
<br /><br />The only downside is that you will get a "warning: textures/common/qer_mirror.tga not found" message when you load the material in the editor. But you won't see a "mirror" texture in your compiled maps anymore.
<br /><br />Oh well.... that's why I gave that editing pack Version numbers. Thanks for pointing out the booboo Docgalad. I will test all the textures/common materials throroughly this time and post a Version 2 ASAP.
<br /><br />UPDATE:
<br /><br />I checked all the textures/common and textures/editor materials in a compiled map and they all work. I uploaded the fixed Version 2 and updated the link in the top post.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p51379" date="Posted: Sat Sep 18, 2004 9:52 am "><author>indianajonesilm</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">WOW!!!!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smili" /><!--

I won't print the complete stats here since those are included in the zip file (along with a readme file). However, here's a quick overlook:&#13;<br /><br />66 materials commented out in Jafo's PAK were in fact good.&#13;<br />53 materials in Jafo's PAK were in fact broken.&#13;<br />These materials were uncommented/commented out accordingly.&#13;<br /><br />But the main difference lies in the fact tht this new PAK has 193 new TGA's to provide for qer_editorimages that were either missing or did not adequately depict what the texture really looks like in the game. Some of you who are currently designing maps in DoomEdit may think this PAK is just eye candy. If so, then consider these figures (compiled at the end of this project):&#13;<br /><br />//=========== Global textures/_ materials stats==============&#13;<br />// &#13;<br />// Total # of textures/_ materials : 3708 &#13;<br />// Total # of working shaders: 1950 (approx. 52.5%) &#13;<br />// Total # of Broken/CommentedOut shaders: 1614 (approx. 43.5%) &#13;<br />// Total # of shaders which can't be used for map texturing and kept by necessity: 144 (approx. 4%) &#13;<br />//==============================================&#13;<br /><br />Now I noticed that many of the materials in the original .mtr files can be misleading. Those may seem to be working but are really broken because the material code calls for a single non-existent TGA. The result is a texture that will display on your brush/patch in the game but won't look right (for eg. a material in which only the specularmap parameter refers to a TGA file that doesn't exist while the bump and diffuse map TGA's <span style="font-weight: bold">do</span> exist).&#13;<br /><br />That means there's a significant chance that you might unknowingly be using broken materials to texture your map's geometry. So this PAK not only improves the look and ease of use of DoomEdit's texture window, it also ensures that you use <span style="font-weight: bold">only</span> 100% working materials to texture your maps.&#13;<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.pcgamemods.com/9082/" class="postlink">DoomEdit CleanMaterials Version 5</a>&#13;<br />(approx 13MB download)&#13;<br /><br />Notes:&#13;<br />- Version 2 has fix for qer_mirror texture appearing on mirrors in game.&#13;<br />- Version 3 fixes the demon spawndecal not appearing in game.&#13;<br />- Version 4 adds the 6 new materials in the V1.1 game patch plus a cosmetic issue with the editorimage textures/editor/redge.tga. Please note that these new materials are not meant to be used for map texturing. They were added so that my PAK won't break the new chat and lag icons in the V1.1 patched game when playing in MP mode. That's the ONLY real change in the V4 CleanMats.&#13;<br />- Version 5 is the final cleanup phase. All the remaining materials have now been cleaned up (models, light, fog, fx's, gui's, particles, etc.). I also improved the qer_editorimage for model based entities in CAM view while in skinned mode. Most monsters/NPC's displayed their displacement map as the editorimage by default. Static models often used their addblend map by default (which made them appear pitch black). Most now use the _local bumpmap which improves visibility and clarity in skinned mode.&#13;<br /><br />- There are no new TGA files in this pak so it's the same size as the last version.&#13;<br /><br />A few broken materials for the sentry character reside in the sentry.def file so you need to download my latest Clean def's PAK to make this 100% complete. Please check the "Editing resources" sticky post in this forum for the URL of the "Clean def's" thread&#13;<br /><br />PS: Mods please update links in other posts to point to this one (if required). Thanks.&#13;<br /><span style="color: orange">[EDIT]new url. kat</span></div>]]></body></post><post id="p50905" date="Posted: Thu Sep 16, 2004 10:08 pm "><author>zeh</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=6012">http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=6012</a><!-- m -->&#13;<br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p50908" date="Posted: Thu Sep 16, 2004 10:14 pm "><author>Eutectic</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Oops... missed that completely.

I did not add any new shaders/materials in the mtr files. All I (and Jafo) did was to comment out the broken materials so they don't get parsed by the editor, that's all.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I guess all the preview images you created from scratch will not be the problem, since these are editor only.</div><br /><br />That's right. The TGA file that the qer_editorimage parameter points to affects only what you see in the editor's texture window and in the CAM view. It has no effect on the the material in the game itself.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">But did some of the shaders e.g. have to be changed to differ from the originals?</div>&#13;<br /><br />Absolutely not. That would have been the worst thing to do and I made it a point to never do that. All the shaders' code were left intact and original. My goal was not to "repair" anything. My goal was simply to sort out which materials really work and which ones don't work. The ones that don't work were commented out, the ones that DO work were left untouched except for the qer_editorimage to improve how it looks in the Texture window. And that's all there is to it.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p51119" date="Posted: Fri Sep 17, 2004 3:48 pm "><author>Brain Trepaning</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks a lot, this will be very helpful for many mappers.

						<div class="postbody">[EDIT] New URL&#13;<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.pcgamemods.com/mod/9082.html">http://www.pcgamemods.com/mod/9082.html</a><!-- m -->&#13;<br /><br />==============================&#13;<br /><br />It's done.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />This is a follow-up of Jafo's d3weditor clean shaders/materials pk4 file which served as a starting base for this new PAK. I won't print the complete stats here since those are included in the zip file (along with a readme file). However, here's a quick overlook:&#13;<br /><br />66 materials commented out in Jafo's PAK were in fact good.&#13;<br />53 materials in Jafo's PAK were in fact broken.&#13;<br />These materials were uncommented/commented out accordingly.&#13;<br /><br />But the main difference lies in the fact tht this new PAK has 193 new TGA's to provide for qer_editorimages that were either missing or did not adequately depict what the texture really looks like in the game. Some of you who are currently designing maps in DoomEdit may think this PAK is just eye candy. If so, then consider these figures (compiled at the end of this project):&#13;<br /><br />//=========== Global textures/_ materials stats==============&#13;<br />// &#13;<br />// Total # of textures/_ materials : 3708 &#13;<br />// Total # of working shaders: 1950 (approx. 52.5%) &#13;<br />// Total # of Broken/CommentedOut shaders: 1614 (approx. 43.5%) &#13;<br />// Total # of shaders which can't be used for map texturing and kept by necessity: 144 (approx. 4%) &#13;<br />//==============================================&#13;<br /><br />Now I noticed that many of the materials in the original .mtr files can be misleading. Those may seem to be working but are really broken because the material code calls for a single non-existent TGA. The result is a texture that will display on your brush/patch in the game but won't look right (for eg. a material in which only the specularmap parameter refers to a TGA file that doesn't exist while the bump and diffuse map TGA's <span style="font-weight: bold">do</span> exist).&#13;<br /><br />That means there's a significant chance that you might unknowingly be using broken materials to texture your map's geometry. So this PAK not only improves the look and ease of use of DoomEdit's texture window, it also ensures that you use <span style="font-weight: bold">only</span> 100% working materials to texture your maps.&#13;<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.pcgamemods.com/9082/" class="postlink">DoomEdit CleanMaterials Version 5</a>&#13;<br />(approx 13MB download)&#13;<br /><br />Notes:&#13;<br />- Version 2 has fix for qer_mirror texture appearing on mirrors in game.&#13;<br />- Version 3 fixes the demon spawndecal not appearing in game.&#13;<br />- Version 4 adds the 6 new materials in the V1.1 game patch plus a cosmetic issue with the editorimage textures/editor/redge.tga. Please note that these new materials are not meant to be used for map texturing. They were added so that my PAK won't break the new chat and lag icons in the V1.1 patched game when playing in MP mode. That's the ONLY real change in the V4 CleanMats.&#13;<br />- Version 5 is the final cleanup phase. All the remaining materials have now been cleaned up (models, light, fog, fx's, gui's, particles, etc.). I also improved the qer_editorimage for model based entities in CAM view while in skinned mode. Most monsters/NPC's displayed their displacement map as the editorimage by default. Static models often used their addblend map by default (which made them appear pitch black). Most now use the _local bumpmap which improves visibility and clarity in skinned mode.&#13;<br /><br />- There are no new TGA files in this pak so it's the same size as the last version.&#13;<br /><br />A few broken materials for the sentry character reside in the sentry.def file so you need to download my latest Clean def's PAK to make this 100% complete. Please check the "Editing resources" sticky post in this forum for the URL of the "Clean def's" thread&#13;<br /><br />PS: Mods please update links in other posts to point to this one (if required). Thanks.&#13;<br /><span style="color: orange">[EDIT]new url. kat</span></div>

						<div class="postbody">Eutectic,&#13;<br />first off wonderful job...&#13;<br /><br />One thing I have been wondering is this. &#13;<br /><br />How will maps using this pack work on a clean (non-development) install of D3. In Q3A there where several special textures provided with GTKradiant editing, that where not part of the clean retail install, thus missing on those machines.&#13;<br /><br />I guess all the preview images you created from scratch will not be the problem, since these are editor only. But did some of the shaders e.g. have to be changed to differ from the originals?</div>

						<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">AEon wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Eutectic,<br />first off wonderful job...<br /><br />One thing I have been wondering is this. <br /><br />How will maps using this pack work on a clean (non-development) install of D3. In Q3A there where several special textures provided with GTKradiant editing, that where not part of the clean retail install, thus missing on those machines.</div><br /><br />Thanks <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Maps made while having this PAK enabled will work just fine in the standard plain-jane Doom3 game. I did not add any new shaders/materials in the mtr files. All I (and Jafo) did was to comment out the broken materials so they don't get parsed by the editor, that's all.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I guess all the preview images you created from scratch will not be the problem, since these are editor only.</div><br /><br />That's right. The TGA file that the qer_editorimage parameter points to affects only what you see in the editor's texture window and in the CAM view. It has no effect on the the material in the game itself.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">But did some of the shaders e.g. have to be changed to differ from the originals?</div>&#13;<br /><br />Absolutely not. That would have been the worst thing to do and I made it a point to never do that. All the shaders' code were left intact and original. My goal was not to "repair" anything. My goal was simply to sort out which materials really work and which ones don't work. The ones that don't work were commented out, the ones that DO work were left untouched except for the qer_editorimage to improve how it looks in the Texture window. And that's all there is to it.</div>

						<div class="postbody">Question:&#13;<br /><br />I have D3 completely unpacked for mapping purposes.  I downloaded the pk4 and put it into base, but the editor is not reading it.&#13;<br /><br />Is it true that the editor cannot mix unpacked with packed?  I ran into this same problem with .def files (I had D3 packed and it wasn't reading my custom .def files, which is what prompted me to unpack them in the first place).  Once I had unpacked the D3 files, my own def files read fine.  It seems like I've hit this issue again.&#13;<br /><br />So bascially the question is, do I have to unpack the clean materials in my unpacked directory for them to read?&#13;<br /><br />Ron</div>

Ingame there is the word mirror on all the mirror surfaces of my maps. So i have to disable ZZ-xxx.pk4 to see the final map properly. <br /><br />A huge *thank you* for the massive work achieved. <br />I can imagine the task, so many notepad openings.<br /><br />Cheers.</div>&#13;<br /><br />You're very welcome. About the textures/common/mirror material, I found the reason why. Here's the material code:&#13;<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">textures/common/mirror<br />{<br />   discrete      // never merge with other surfaces<br />   qer_editorimage textures/common/qer_mirror.tga<br />   solid<br />   mirror<br />   {<br />      blend add<br />      map textures/common/qer_mirror.tga<br />   }<br />}</div>&#13;<br /><br />The TGA file "textures/common/qer_mirror.tga" is not present in the original game's pak004.pk4 , therefore you don't get this problem in the original game. The problem with this material is that that TGA image is used as a blendmap in the original code. It's not the qer_editorimage that causes this but the blend add stage.&#13;<br /><br />Incidentally, I didn't create this image, my predecessor did. But ultimately it's my fault. I didn't test the textures/common materials thoroughly enough assuming there couldn't be anything wrong about those since they're so simple and straighforward.&#13;<br /><br />I will fix that by renaming the qer_mirror.tga to something else and edit the qer_editorimage line to point to the renamed image instead. I won't change the blend add stage of course - the idea is that it must NOT find the TGA file it points to. The shader probably needs a blend add stage pointing to an inexistent texture to work properly (at least that's what I'm guessing). In any case, I musn't change the original shader code, I have to work around it.&#13;<br /><br />The only downside is that you will get a "warning: textures/common/qer_mirror.tga not found" message when you load the material in the editor. But you won't see a "mirror" texture in your compiled maps anymore.&#13;<br /><br />Oh well.... that's why I gave that editing pack Version numbers. Thanks for pointing out the booboo Docgalad. I will test all the textures/common materials throroughly this time and post a Version 2 ASAP.&#13;<br /><br />UPDATE:&#13;<br /><br />I checked all the textures/common and textures/editor materials in a compiled map and they all work. I uploaded the fixed Version 2 and updated the link in the top post.</div>

<br /><br />It's done.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />This is a follow-up of Jafo's d3weditor clean shaders/materials pk4 file which served as a starting base for this new PAK. I won't print the complete stats here since those are included in the zip file (along with a readme file). However, here's a quick overlook:
<br /><br />66 materials commented out in Jafo's PAK were in fact good.
<br />53 materials in Jafo's PAK were in fact broken.
<br />These materials were uncommented/commented out accordingly.
<br /><br />But the main difference lies in the fact tht this new PAK has 193 new TGA's to provide for qer_editorimages that were either missing or did not adequately depict what the texture really looks like in the game. Some of you who are currently designing maps in DoomEdit may think this PAK is just eye candy. If so, then consider these figures (compiled at the end of this project):
<br /><br />//=========== Global textures/_ materials stats==============
<br />// 
<br />// Total # of textures/_ materials : 3708 
<br />// Total # of working shaders: 1950 (approx. 52.5%) 
<br />// Total # of Broken/CommentedOut shaders: 1614 (approx. 43.5%) 
<br />// Total # of shaders which can't be used for map texturing and kept by necessity: 144 (approx. 4%) 
<br />//==============================================
<br /><br />Now I noticed that many of the materials in the original .mtr files can be misleading. Those may seem to be working but are really broken because the material code calls for a single non-existent TGA. The result is a texture that will display on your brush/patch in the game but won't look right (for eg. a material in which only the specularmap parameter refers to a TGA file that doesn't exist while the bump and diffuse map TGA's <span style="font-weight: bold">do</span> exist).
<br /><br />That means there's a significant chance that you might unknowingly be using broken materials to texture your map's geometry. So this PAK not only improves the look and ease of use of DoomEdit's texture window, it also ensures that you use <span style="font-weight: bold">only</span> 100% working materials to texture your maps.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.pcgamemods.com/9082/" class="postlink">DoomEdit CleanMaterials Version 5</a>
<br />(approx 13MB download)
<br /><br />Notes:
<br />- Version 2 has fix for qer_mirror texture appearing on mirrors in game.
<br />- Version 3 fixes the demon spawndecal not appearing in game.
<br />- Version 4 adds the 6 new materials in the V1.1 game patch plus a cosmetic issue with the editorimage textures/editor/redge.tga. Please note that these new materials are not meant to be used for map texturing. They were added so that my PAK won't break the new chat and lag icons in the V1.1 patched game when playing in MP mode. That's the ONLY real change in the V4 CleanMats.
<br />- Version 5 is the final cleanup phase. All the remaining materials have now been cleaned up (models, light, fog, fx's, gui's, particles, etc.). I also improved the qer_editorimage for model based entities in CAM view while in skinned mode. Most monsters/NPC's displayed their displacement map as the editorimage by default. Static models often used their addblend map by default (which made them appear pitch black). Most now use the _local bumpmap which improves visibility and clarity in skinned mode.
<br /><br />- There are no new TGA files in this pak so it's the same size as the last version.
<br /><br />A few broken materials for the sentry character reside in the sentry.def file so you need to download my latest Clean def's PAK to make this 100% complete. Please check the "Editing resources" sticky post in this forum for the URL of the "Clean def's" thread
<br /><br />PS: Mods please update links in other posts to point to this one (if required). Thanks.

<br /><br />Absolutely not. That would have been the worst thing to do and I made it a point to never do that. All the shaders' code were left intact and original. My goal was not to "repair" anything. My goal was simply to sort out which materials really work and which ones don't work. The ones that don't work were commented out, the ones that DO work were left untouched except for the qer_editorimage to improve how it looks in the Texture window. And that's all there is to it.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p51119" date="Posted: Fri Sep 17, 2004 3:48 pm "><author>Brain Trepaning</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks a lot, this will be very helpful for many mappers.

<br /><br />I have D3 completely unpacked for mapping purposes.  I downloaded the pk4 and put it into base, but the editor is not reading it.
<br /><br />Is it true that the editor cannot mix unpacked with packed?  I ran into this same problem with .def files (I had D3 packed and it wasn't reading my custom .def files, which is what prompted me to unpack them in the first place).  Once I had unpacked the D3 files, my own def files read fine.  It seems like I've hit this issue again.
<br /><br />So bascially the question is, do I have to unpack the clean materials in my unpacked directory for them to read?

<br /><br />You're very welcome. About the textures/common/mirror material, I found the reason why. Here's the material code:
<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">textures/common/mirror<br />{<br />   discrete      // never merge with other surfaces<br />   qer_editorimage textures/common/qer_mirror.tga<br />   solid<br />   mirror<br />   {<br />      blend add<br />      map textures/common/qer_mirror.tga<br />   }<br />}</div>
<br /><br />The TGA file "textures/common/qer_mirror.tga" is not present in the original game's pak004.pk4 , therefore you don't get this problem in the original game. The problem with this material is that that TGA image is used as a blendmap in the original code. It's not the qer_editorimage that causes this but the blend add stage.
<br /><br />Incidentally, I didn't create this image, my predecessor did. But ultimately it's my fault. I didn't test the textures/common materials thoroughly enough assuming there couldn't be anything wrong about those since they're so simple and straighforward.
<br /><br />I will fix that by renaming the qer_mirror.tga to something else and edit the qer_editorimage line to point to the renamed image instead. I won't change the blend add stage of course - the idea is that it must NOT find the TGA file it points to. The shader probably needs a blend add stage pointing to an inexistent texture to work properly (at least that's what I'm guessing). In any case, I musn't change the original shader code, I have to work around it.
<br /><br />The only downside is that you will get a "warning: textures/common/qer_mirror.tga not found" message when you load the material in the editor. But you won't see a "mirror" texture in your compiled maps anymore.
<br /><br />Oh well.... that's why I gave that editing pack Version numbers. Thanks for pointing out the booboo Docgalad. I will test all the textures/common materials throroughly this time and post a Version 2 ASAP.
<br /><br />UPDATE:
<br /><br />I checked all the textures/common and textures/editor materials in a compiled map and they all work. I uploaded the fixed Version 2 and updated the link in the top post.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p51379" date="Posted: Sat Sep 18, 2004 9:52 am "><author>indianajonesilm</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">WOW!!!!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilie" /><!--

<br /><br />You're very welcome. About the textures/common/mirror material, I found the reason why. Here's the material code:
<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">textures/common/mirror<br />{<br />   discrete      // never merge with other surfaces<br />   qer_editorimage textures/common/qer_mirror.tga<br />   solid<br />   mirror<br />   {<br />      blend add<br />      map textures/common/qer_mirror.tga<br />   }<br />}</div>
<br /><br />The TGA file "textures/common/qer_mirror.tga" is not present in the original game's pak004.pk4 , therefore you don't get this problem in the original game. The problem with this material is that that TGA image is used as a blendmap in the original code. It's not the qer_editorimage that causes this but the blend add stage.
<br /><br />Incidentally, I didn't create this image, my predecessor did. But ultimately it's my fault. I didn't test the textures/common materials thoroughly enough assuming there couldn't be anything wrong about those since they're so simple and straighforward.
<br /><br />I will fix that by renaming the qer_mirror.tga to something else and edit the qer_editorimage line to point to the renamed image instead. I won't change the blend add stage of course - the idea is that it must NOT find the TGA file it points to. The shader probably needs a blend add stage pointing to an inexistent texture to work properly (at least that's what I'm guessing). In any case, I musn't change the original shader code, I have to work around it.
<br /><br />The only downside is that you will get a "warning: textures/common/qer_mirror.tga not found" message when you load the material in the editor. But you won't see a "mirror" texture in your compiled maps anymore.
<br /><br />Oh well.... that's why I gave that editing pack Version numbers. Thanks for pointing out the booboo Docgalad. I will test all the textures/common materials throroughly this time and post a Version 2 ASAP.
<br /><br />UPDATE:
<br /><br />I checked all the textures/common and textures/editor materials in a compiled map and they all work. I uploaded the fixed Version 2 and updated the link in the top post.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p51379" date="Posted: Sat Sep 18, 2004 9:52 am "><author>indianajonesilm</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">WOW!!!!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilie" /><!--

<br /><br />==============================
<br /><br />It's done.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />This is a follow-up of Jafo's d3weditor clean shaders/materials pk4 file which served as a starting base for this new PAK. I won't print the complete stats here since those are included in the zip file (along with a readme file). However, here's a quick overlook:
<br /><br />66 materials commented out in Jafo's PAK were in fact good.
<br />53 materials in Jafo's PAK were in fact broken.
<br />These materials were uncommented/commented out accordingly.
<br /><br />But the main difference lies in the fact tht this new PAK has 193 new TGA's to provide for qer_editorimages that were either missing or did not adequately depict what the texture really looks like in the game. Some of you who are currently designing maps in DoomEdit may think this PAK is just eye candy. If so, then consider these figures (compiled at the end of this project):
<br /><br />//=========== Global textures/_ materials stats==============
<br />// 
<br />// Total # of textures/_ materials : 3708 
<br />// Total # of working shaders: 1950 (approx. 52.5%) 
<br />// Total # of Broken/CommentedOut shaders: 1614 (approx. 43.5%) 
<br />// Total # of shaders which can't be used for map texturing and kept by necessity: 144 (approx. 4%) 
<br />//==============================================
<br /><br />Now I noticed that many of the materials in the original .mtr files can be misleading. Those may seem to be working but are really broken because the material code calls for a single non-existent TGA. The result is a texture that will display on your brush/patch in the game but won't look right (for eg. a material in which only the specularmap parameter refers to a TGA file that doesn't exist while the bump and diffuse map TGA's <span style="font-weight: bold">do</span> exist).
<br /><br />That means there's a significant chance that you might unknowingly be using broken materials to texture your map's geometry. So this PAK not only improves the look and ease of use of DoomEdit's texture window, it also ensures that you use <span style="font-weight: bold">only</span> 100% working materials to texture your maps.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.pcgamemods.com/9082/" class="postlink">DoomEdit CleanMaterials Version 5</a>
<br />(approx 13MB download)
<br /><br />Notes:
<br />- Version 2 has fix for qer_mirror texture appearing on mirrors in game.
<br />- Version 3 fixes the demon spawndecal not appearing in game.
<br />- Version 4 adds the 6 new materials in the V1.1 game patch plus a cosmetic issue with the editorimage textures/editor/redge.tga. Please note that these new materials are not meant to be used for map texturing. They were added so that my PAK won't break the new chat and lag icons in the V1.1 patched game when playing in MP mode. That's the ONLY real change in the V4 CleanMats.
<br />- Version 5 is the final cleanup phase. All the remaining materials have now been cleaned up (models, light, fog, fx's, gui's, particles, etc.). I also improved the qer_editorimage for model based entities in CAM view while in skinned mode. Most monsters/NPC's displayed their displacement map as the editorimage by default. Static models often used their addblend map by default (which made them appear pitch black). Most now use the _local bumpmap which improves visibility and clarity in skinned mode.
<br /><br />- There are no new TGA files in this pak so it's the same size as the last version.
<br /><br />A few broken materials for the sentry character reside in the sentry.def file so you need to download my latest Clean def's PAK to make this 100% complete. Please check the "Editing resources" sticky post in this forum for the URL of the "Clean def's" thread
<br /><br />PS: Mods please update links in other posts to point to this one (if required). Thanks.

I did not add any new shaders/materials in the mtr files. All I (and Jafo) did was to comment out the broken materials so they don't get parsed by the editor, that's all.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I guess all the preview images you created from scratch will not be the problem, since these are editor only.</div><br /><br />That's right. The TGA file that the qer_editorimage parameter points to affects only what you see in the editor's texture window and in the CAM view.

<br /><br />Absolutely not. That would have been the worst thing to do and I made it a point to never do that. All the shaders' code were left intact and original. My goal was not to "repair" anything. My goal was simply to sort out which materials really work and which ones don't work. The ones that don't work were commented out, the ones that DO work were left untouched except for the qer_editorimage to improve how it looks in the Texture window. And that's all there is to it.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p51119" date="Posted: Fri Sep 17, 2004 3:48 pm "><author>Brain Trepaning</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks a lot, this will be very helpful for many mappers.

Those may seem to be working but are really broken because the material code calls for a single non-existent TGA. The result is a texture that will display on your brush/patch in the game but won't look right (for eg. a material in which only the specularmap parameter refers to a TGA file that doesn't exist while the bump and diffuse map TGA's <span style="font-weight: bold">do</span> exist).
<br /><br />That means there's a significant chance that you might unknowingly be using broken materials to texture your map's geometry. So this PAK not only improves the look and ease of use of DoomEdit's texture window, it also ensures that you use <span style="font-weight: bold">only</span> 100% working materials to texture your maps.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.pcgamemods.com/9082/" class="postlink">DoomEdit CleanMaterials Version 5</a>
<br />(approx 13MB download)
<br /><br />Notes:
<br />- Version 2 has fix for qer_mirror texture appearing on mirrors in game.
<br />- Version 3 fixes the demon spawndecal not appearing in game.
<br />- Version 4 adds the 6 new materials in the V1.1 game patch plus a cosmetic issue with the editorimage textures/editor/redge.tga. Please note that these new materials are not meant to be used for map texturing. They were added so that my PAK won't break the new chat and lag icons in the V1.1 patched game when playing in MP mode. That's the ONLY real change in the V4 CleanMats.
<br />- Version 5 is the final cleanup phase. All the remaining materials have now been cleaned up (models, light, fog, fx's, gui's, particles, etc.). I also improved the qer_editorimage for model based entities in CAM view while in skinned mode. Most monsters/NPC's displayed their displacement map as the editorimage by default. Static models often used their addblend map by default (which made them appear pitch black). Most now use the _local bumpmap which improves visibility and clarity in skinned mode.
<br /><br />- There are no new TGA files in this pak so it's the same size as the last version.
<br /><br />A few broken materials for the sentry character reside in the sentry.def file so you need to download my latest Clean def's PAK to make this 100% complete. Please check the "Editing resources" sticky post in this forum for the URL of the "Clean def's" thread
<br /><br />PS: Mods please update links in other posts to point to this one (if required). Thanks.

<br /><br />Absolutely not. That would have been the worst thing to do and I made it a point to never do that. All the shaders' code were left intact and original. My goal was not to "repair" anything. My goal was simply to sort out which materials really work and which ones don't work. The ones that don't work were commented out, the ones that DO work were left untouched except for the qer_editorimage to improve how it looks in the Texture window. And that's all there is to it.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p51119" date="Posted: Fri Sep 17, 2004 3:48 pm "><author>Brain Trepaning</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks a lot, this will be very helpful for many mappers.

<br /><br />You're very welcome. About the textures/common/mirror material, I found the reason why. Here's the material code:
<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">textures/common/mirror<br />{<br />   discrete      // never merge with other surfaces<br />   qer_editorimage textures/common/qer_mirror.tga<br />   solid<br />   mirror<br />   {<br />      blend add<br />      map textures/common/qer_mirror.tga<br />   }<br />}</div>
<br /><br />The TGA file "textures/common/qer_mirror.tga" is not present in the original game's pak004.pk4 , therefore you don't get this problem in the original game. The problem with this material is that that TGA image is used as a blendmap in the original code. It's not the qer_editorimage that causes this but the blend add stage.
<br /><br />Incidentally, I didn't create this image, my predecessor did. But ultimately it's my fault. I didn't test the textures/common materials thoroughly enough assuming there couldn't be anything wrong about those since they're so simple and straighforward.
<br /><br />I will fix that by renaming the qer_mirror.tga to something else and edit the qer_editorimage line to point to the renamed image instead. I won't change the blend add stage of course - the idea is that it must NOT find the TGA file it points to. The shader probably needs a blend add stage pointing to an inexistent texture to work properly (at least that's what I'm guessing). In any case, I musn't change the original shader code, I have to work around it.
<br /><br />The only downside is that you will get a "warning: textures/common/qer_mirror.tga not found" message when you load the material in the editor. But you won't see a "mirror" texture in your compiled maps anymore.
<br /><br />Oh well.... that's why I gave that editing pack Version numbers. Thanks for pointing out the booboo Docgalad. I will test all the textures/common materials throroughly this time and post a Version 2 ASAP.
<br /><br />UPDATE:
<br /><br />I checked all the textures/common and textures/editor materials in a compiled map and they all work. I uploaded the fixed Version 2 and updated the link in the top post.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p51379" date="Posted: Sat Sep 18, 2004 9:52 am "><author>indianajonesilm</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">WOW!!!!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smili" /><!--

<br /><br />==============================
<br /><br />It's done.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />This is a follow-up of Jafo's d3weditor clean shaders/materials pk4 file which served as a starting base for this new PAK. I won't print the complete stats here since those are included in the zip file (along with a readme file). However, here's a quick overlook:
<br /><br />66 materials commented out in Jafo's PAK were in fact good.
<br />53 materials in Jafo's PAK were in fact broken.
<br />These materials were uncommented/commented out accordingly.
<br /><br />But the main difference lies in the fact tht this new PAK has 193 new TGA's to provide for qer_editorimages that were either missing or did not adequately depict what the texture really looks like in the game. Some of you who are currently designing maps in DoomEdit may think this PAK is just eye candy. If so, then consider these figures (compiled at the end of this project):
<br /><br />//=========== Global textures/_ materials stats==============
<br />// 
<br />// Total # of textures/_ materials : 3708 
<br />// Total # of working shaders: 1950 (approx. 52.5%) 
<br />// Total # of Broken/CommentedOut shaders: 1614 (approx. 43.5%) 
<br />// Total # of shaders which can't be used for map texturing and kept by necessity: 144 (approx. 4%) 
<br />//==============================================
<br /><br />Now I noticed that many of the materials in the original .mtr files can be misleading. Those may seem to be working but are really broken because the material code calls for a single non-existent TGA. The result is a texture that will display on your brush/patch in the game but won't look right (for eg. a material in which only the specularmap parameter refers to a TGA file that doesn't exist while the bump and diffuse map TGA's <span style="font-weight: bold">do</span> exist).

<br /><br />You're very welcome. About the textures/common/mirror material, I found the reason why. Here's the material code:
<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">textures/common/mirror<br />{<br />   discrete      // never merge with other surfaces<br />   qer_editorimage textures/common/qer_mirror.tga<br />   solid<br />   mirror<br />   {<br />      blend add<br />      map textures/common/qer_mirror.tga<br />   }<br />}</div>
<br /><br />The TGA file "textures/common/qer_mirror.tga" is not present in the original game's pak004.pk4 , therefore you don't get this problem in the original game. The problem with this material is that that TGA image is used as a blendmap in the original code. It's not the qer_editorimage that causes this but the blend add stage.
<br /><br />Incidentally, I didn't create this image, my predecessor did. But ultimately it's my fault. I didn't test the textures/common materials thoroughly enough assuming there couldn't be anything wrong about those since they're so simple and straighforward.
<br /><br />I will fix that by renaming the qer_mirror.tga to something else and edit the qer_editorimage line to point to the renamed image instead. I won't change the blend add stage of course - the idea is that it must NOT find the TGA file it points to. The shader probably needs a blend add stage pointing to an inexistent texture to work properly (at least that's what I'm guessing). In any case, I musn't change the original shader code, I have to work around it.
<br /><br />The only downside is that you will get a "warning: textures/common/qer_mirror.tga not found" message when you load the material in the editor. But you won't see a "mirror" texture in your compiled maps anymore.
<br /><br />Oh well.... that's why I gave that editing pack Version numbers. Thanks for pointing out the booboo Docgalad. I will test all the textures/common materials throroughly this time and post a Version 2 ASAP.
<br /><br />UPDATE:
<br /><br />I checked all the textures/common and textures/editor materials in a compiled map and they all work. I uploaded the fixed Version 2 and updated the link in the top post.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p51379" date="Posted: Sat Sep 18, 2004 9:52 am "><author>indianajonesilm</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">WOW!!!!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilie" /><!--

<br /><br />==============================
<br /><br />It's done.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />This is a follow-up of Jafo's d3weditor clean shaders/materials pk4 file which served as a starting base for this new PAK. I won't print the complete stats here since those are included in the zip file (along with a readme file). However, here's a quick overlook:
<br /><br />66 materials commented out in Jafo's PAK were in fact good.
<br />53 materials in Jafo's PAK were in fact broken.
<br />These materials were uncommented/commented out accordingly.
<br /><br />But the main difference lies in the fact tht this new PAK has 193 new TGA's to provide for qer_editorimages that were either missing or did not adequately depict what the texture really looks like in the game. Some of you who are currently designing maps in DoomEdit may think this PAK is just eye candy. If so, then consider these figures (compiled at the end of this project):
<br /><br />//=========== Global textures/_ materials stats==============
<br />// 
<br />// Total # of textures/_ materials : 3708 
<br />// Total # of working shaders: 1950 (approx. 52.5%) 
<br />// Total # of Broken/CommentedOut shaders: 1614 (approx. 43.5%) 
<br />// Total # of shaders which can't be used for map texturing and kept by necessity: 144 (approx. 4%) 
<br />//==============================================
<br /><br />Now I noticed that many of the materials in the original .mtr files can be misleading. Those may seem to be working but are really broken because the material code calls for a single non-existent TGA. The result is a texture that will display on your brush/patch in the game but won't look right (for eg. a material in which only the specularmap parameter refers to a TGA file that doesn't exist while the bump and diffuse map TGA's <span style="font-weight: bold">do</span> exist).
<br /><br />That means there's a significant chance that you might unknowingly be using broken materials to texture your map's geometry. So this PAK not only improves the look and ease of use of DoomEdit's texture window, it also ensures that you use <span style="font-weight: bold">only</span> 100% working materials to texture your maps.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.pcgamemods.com/9082/" class="postlink">DoomEdit CleanMaterials Version 5</a>
<br />(approx 13MB download)
<br /><br />Notes:
<br />- Version 2 has fix for qer_mirror texture appearing on mirrors in game.
<br />- Version 3 fixes the demon spawndecal not appearing in game.
<br />- Version 4 adds the 6 new materials in the V1.1 game patch plus a cosmetic issue with the editorimage textures/editor/redge.tga. Please note that these new materials are not meant to be used for map texturing. They were added so that my PAK won't break the new chat and lag icons in the V1.1 patched game when playing in MP mode. That's the ONLY real change in the V4 CleanMats.
<br />- Version 5 is the final cleanup phase. All the remaining materials have now been cleaned up (models, light, fog, fx's, gui's, particles, etc.). I also improved the qer_editorimage for model based entities in CAM view while in skinned mode. Most monsters/NPC's displayed their displacement map as the editorimage by default. Static models often used their addblend map by default (which made them appear pitch black). Most now use the _local bumpmap which improves visibility and clarity in skinned mode.
<br /><br />- There are no new TGA files in this pak so it's the same size as the last version.
<br /><br />A few broken materials for the sentry character reside in the sentry.def file so you need to download my latest Clean def's PAK to make this 100% complete. Please check the "Editing resources" sticky post in this forum for the URL of the "Clean def's" thread
<br /><br />PS: Mods please update links in other posts to point to this one (if required). Thanks.

<br /><br />One thing I have been wondering is this. 
<br /><br />How will maps using this pack work on a clean (non-development) install of D3. In Q3A there where several special textures provided with GTKradiant editing, that where not part of the clean retail install, thus missing on those machines.

I did not add any new shaders/materials in the mtr files. All I (and Jafo) did was to comment out the broken materials so they don't get parsed by the editor, that's all.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I guess all the preview images you created from scratch will not be the problem, since these are editor only.</div><br /><br />That's right. The TGA file that the qer_editorimage parameter points to affects only what you see in the editor's texture window and in the CAM view. It has no effect on the the material in the game itself.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">But did some of the shaders e.g. have to be changed to differ from the originals?</div>
<br /><br />Absolutely not. That would have been the worst thing to do and I made it a point to never do that. All the shaders' code were left intact and original. My goal was not to "repair" anything. My goal was simply to sort out which materials really work and which ones don't work. The ones that don't work were commented out, the ones that DO work were left untouched except for the qer_editorimage to improve how it looks in the Texture window. And that's all there is to it.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p51119" date="Posted: Fri Sep 17, 2004 3:48 pm "><author>Brain Trepaning</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks a lot, this will be very helpful for many mappers.

<br /><br />I have D3 completely unpacked for mapping purposes.  I downloaded the pk4 and put it into base, but the editor is not reading it.
<br /><br />Is it true that the editor cannot mix unpacked with packed?  I ran into this same problem with .def files (I had D3 packed and it wasn't reading my custom .def files, which is what prompted me to unpack them in the first place).  Once I had unpacked the D3 files, my own def files read fine.  It seems like I've hit this issue again.
<br /><br />So bascially the question is, do I have to unpack the clean materials in my unpacked directory for them to read?

Most now use the _local bumpmap which improves visibility and clarity in skinned mode.&#13;<br /><br />- There are no new TGA files in this pak so it's the same size as the last version.&#13;<br /><br />A few broken materials for the sentry character reside in the sentry.def file so you need to download my latest Clean def's PAK to make this 100% complete. Please check the "Editing resources" sticky post in this forum for the URL of the "Clean def's" thread&#13;<br /><br />PS: Mods please update links in other posts to point to this one (if required). Thanks.&#13;<br /><span style="color: orange">[EDIT]new url. kat</span></div>]]></body></post><post id="p50905" date="Posted: Thu Sep 16, 2004 10:08 pm "><author>zeh</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=6012">http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=6012</a><!-- m -->&#13;<br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p50908" date="Posted: Thu Sep 16, 2004 10:14 pm "><author>Eutectic</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Oops... missed that completely.

I did not add any new shaders/materials in the mtr files. All I (and Jafo) did was to comment out the broken materials so they don't get parsed by the editor, that's all.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I guess all the preview images you created from scratch will not be the problem, since these are editor only.</div><br /><br />That's right. The TGA file that the qer_editorimage parameter points to affects only what you see in the editor's texture window and in the CAM view. It has no effect on the the material in the game itself.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">But did some of the shaders e.g. have to be changed to differ from the originals?</div>&#13;<br /><br />Absolutely not. That would have been the worst thing to do and I made it a point to never do that. All the shaders' code were left intact and original. My goal was not to "repair" anything. My goal was simply to sort out which materials really work and which ones don't work. The ones that don't work were commented out, the ones that DO work were left untouched except for the qer_editorimage to improve how it looks in the Texture window. And that's all there is to it.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p51119" date="Posted: Fri Sep 17, 2004 3:48 pm "><author>Brain Trepaning</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks a lot, this will be very helpful for many mappers.

I ran into this same problem with .def files (I had D3 packed and it wasn't reading my custom .def files, which is what prompted me to unpack them in the first place).  Once I had unpacked the D3 files, my own def files read fine.

So i have to disable ZZ-xxx.pk4 to see the final map properly. <br /><br />A huge *thank you* for the massive work achieved. <br />I can imagine the task, so many notepad openings.<br /><br />Cheers.</div>&#13;<br /><br />You're very welcome. About the textures/common/mirror material, I found the reason why. Here's the material code:&#13;<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">textures/common/mirror<br />{<br />   discrete      // never merge with other surfaces<br />   qer_editorimage textures/common/qer_mirror.tga<br />   solid<br />   mirror<br />   {<br />      blend add<br />      map textures/common/qer_mirror.tga<br />   }<br />}</div>&#13;<br /><br />The TGA file "textures/common/qer_mirror.tga" is not present in the original game's pak004.pk4 , therefore you don't get this problem in the original game. The problem with this material is that that TGA image is used as a blendmap in the original code. It's not the qer_editorimage that causes this but the blend add stage.&#13;<br /><br />Incidentally, I didn't create this image, my predecessor did. But ultimately it's my fault. I didn't test the textures/common materials thoroughly enough assuming there couldn't be anything wrong about those since they're so simple and straighforward.&#13;<br /><br />I will fix that by renaming the qer_mirror.tga to something else and edit the qer_editorimage line to point to the renamed image instead. I won't change the blend add stage of course - the idea is that it must NOT find the TGA file it points to. The shader probably needs a blend add stage pointing to an inexistent texture to work properly (at least that's what I'm guessing). In any case, I musn't change the original shader code, I have to work around it.&#13;<br /><br />The only downside is that you will get a "warning: textures/common/qer_mirror.tga not found" message when you load the material in the editor. But you won't see a "mirror" texture in your compiled maps anymore.&#13;<br /><br />Oh well.... that's why I gave that editing pack Version numbers. Thanks for pointing out the booboo Docgalad. I will test all the textures/common materials throroughly this time and post a Version 2 ASAP.&#13;<br /><br />UPDATE:&#13;<br /><br />I checked all the textures/common and textures/editor materials in a compiled map and they all work. I uploaded the fixed Version 2 and updated the link in the top post.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p51379" date="Posted: Sat Sep 18, 2004 9:52 am "><author>indianajonesilm</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">WOW!!!!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br />I would just like to say THANK YOU to all involved in making this.

						<div class="postbody">[EDIT] New URL&#13;<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.pcgamemods.com/mod/9082.html">http://www.pcgamemods.com/mod/9082.html</a><!-- m -->&#13;<br /><br />==============================&#13;<br /><br />It's done.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />This is a follow-up of Jafo's d3weditor clean shaders/materials pk4 file which served as a starting base for this new PAK. I won't print the complete stats here since those are included in the zip file (along with a readme file). However, here's a quick overlook:&#13;<br /><br />66 materials commented out in Jafo's PAK were in fact good.&#13;<br />53 materials in Jafo's PAK were in fact broken.&#13;<br />These materials were uncommented/commented out accordingly.&#13;<br /><br />But the main difference lies in the fact tht this new PAK has 193 new TGA's to provide for qer_editorimages that were either missing or did not adequately depict what the texture really looks like in the game. Some of you who are currently designing maps in DoomEdit may think this PAK is just eye candy. If so, then consider these figures (compiled at the end of this project):&#13;<br /><br />//=========== Global textures/_ materials stats==============&#13;<br />// &#13;<br />// Total # of textures/_ materials : 3708 &#13;<br />// Total # of working shaders: 1950 (approx. 52.5%) &#13;<br />// Total # of Broken/CommentedOut shaders: 1614 (approx. 43.5%) &#13;<br />// Total # of shaders which can't be used for map texturing and kept by necessity: 144 (approx. 4%) &#13;<br />//==============================================&#13;<br /><br />Now I noticed that many of the materials in the original .mtr files can be misleading. Those may seem to be working but are really broken because the material code calls for a single non-existent TGA. The result is a texture that will display on your brush/patch in the game but won't look right (for eg. a material in which only the specularmap parameter refers to a TGA file that doesn't exist while the bump and diffuse map TGA's <span style="font-weight: bold">do</span> exist).&#13;<br /><br />That means there's a significant chance that you might unknowingly be using broken materials to texture your map's geometry. So this PAK not only improves the look and ease of use of DoomEdit's texture window, it also ensures that you use <span style="font-weight: bold">only</span> 100% working materials to texture your maps.&#13;<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.pcgamemods.com/9082/" class="postlink">DoomEdit CleanMaterials Version 5</a>&#13;<br />(approx 13MB download)&#13;<br /><br />Notes:&#13;<br />- Version 2 has fix for qer_mirror texture appearing on mirrors in game.&#13;<br />- Version 3 fixes the demon spawndecal not appearing in game.&#13;<br />- Version 4 adds the 6 new materials in the V1.1 game patch plus a cosmetic issue with the editorimage textures/editor/redge.tga. Please note that these new materials are not meant to be used for map texturing. They were added so that my PAK won't break the new chat and lag icons in the V1.1 patched game when playing in MP mode. That's the ONLY real change in the V4 CleanMats.&#13;<br />- Version 5 is the final cleanup phase. All the remaining materials have now been cleaned up (models, light, fog, fx's, gui's, particles, etc.). I also improved the qer_editorimage for model based entities in CAM view while in skinned mode. Most monsters/NPC's displayed their displacement map as the editorimage by default. Static models often used their addblend map by default (which made them appear pitch black). Most now use the _local bumpmap which improves visibility and clarity in skinned mode.&#13;<br /><br />- There are no new TGA files in this pak so it's the same size as the last version.&#13;<br /><br />A few broken materials for the sentry character reside in the sentry.def file so you need to download my latest Clean def's PAK to make this 100% complete. Please check the "Editing resources" sticky post in this forum for the URL of the "Clean def's" thread&#13;<br /><br />PS: Mods please update links in other posts to point to this one (if required). Thanks.&#13;<br /><span style="color: orange">[EDIT]new url. kat</span></div>

The TGA file that the qer_editorimage parameter points to affects only what you see in the editor's texture window and in the CAM view. It has no effect on the the material in the game itself.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">But did some of the shaders e.g. have to be changed to differ from the originals?</div>&#13;<br /><br />Absolutely not. That would have been the worst thing to do and I made it a point to never do that. All the shaders' code were left intact and original. My goal was not to "repair" anything. My goal was simply to sort out which materials really work and which ones don't work. The ones that don't work were commented out, the ones that DO work were left untouched except for the qer_editorimage to improve how it looks in the Texture window. And that's all there is to it.</div>

						<div class="postbody">Question:&#13;<br /><br />I have D3 completely unpacked for mapping purposes.  I downloaded the pk4 and put it into base, but the editor is not reading it.&#13;<br /><br />Is it true that the editor cannot mix unpacked with packed?  I ran into this same problem with .def files (I had D3 packed and it wasn't reading my custom .def files, which is what prompted me to unpack them in the first place).  Once I had unpacked the D3 files, my own def files read fine.  It seems like I've hit this issue again.&#13;<br /><br />So bascially the question is, do I have to unpack the clean materials in my unpacked directory for them to read?&#13;<br /><br />Ron</div>

						<div class="postbody">That may work.&#13;<br /><br />But, I'd advise that if you need to extract the vanilla pk4s for reference then you extract them to somewhere outside the Doom 3 folder. This way you don't have to worry about problems like this where something that should work doesn't.</div>

Ingame there is the word mirror on all the mirror surfaces of my maps. So i have to disable ZZ-xxx.pk4 to see the final map properly. <br /><br />A huge *thank you* for the massive work achieved. <br />I can imagine the task, so many notepad openings.<br /><br />Cheers.</div>&#13;<br /><br />You're very welcome. About the textures/common/mirror material, I found the reason why. Here's the material code:&#13;<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">textures/common/mirror<br />{<br />   discrete      // never merge with other surfaces<br />   qer_editorimage textures/common/qer_mirror.tga<br />   solid<br />   mirror<br />   {<br />      blend add<br />      map textures/common/qer_mirror.tga<br />   }<br />}</div>&#13;<br /><br />The TGA file "textures/common/qer_mirror.tga" is not present in the original game's pak004.pk4 , therefore you don't get this problem in the original game. The problem with this material is that that TGA image is used as a blendmap in the original code. It's not the qer_editorimage that causes this but the blend add stage.&#13;<br /><br />Incidentally, I didn't create this image, my predecessor did. But ultimately it's my fault. I didn't test the textures/common materials thoroughly enough assuming there couldn't be anything wrong about those since they're so simple and straighforward.&#13;<br /><br />I will fix that by renaming the qer_mirror.tga to something else and edit the qer_editorimage line to point to the renamed image instead. I won't change the blend add stage of course - the idea is that it must NOT find the TGA file it points to. The shader probably needs a blend add stage pointing to an inexistent texture to work properly (at least that's what I'm guessing). In any case, I musn't change the original shader code, I have to work around it.&#13;<br /><br />The only downside is that you will get a "warning: textures/common/qer_mirror.tga not found" message when you load the material in the editor. But you won't see a "mirror" texture in your compiled maps anymore.&#13;<br /><br />Oh well.... that's why I gave that editing pack Version numbers. Thanks for pointing out the booboo Docgalad. I will test all the textures/common materials throroughly this time and post a Version 2 ASAP.&#13;<br /><br />UPDATE:&#13;<br /><br />I checked all the textures/common and textures/editor materials in a compiled map and they all work. I uploaded the fixed Version 2 and updated the link in the top post.</div>

<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.pcgamemods.com/mod/9082.html">http://www.pcgamemods.com/mod/9082.html</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />==============================
<br /><br />It's done.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />This is a follow-up of Jafo's d3weditor clean shaders/materials pk4 file which served as a starting base for this new PAK. I won't print the complete stats here since those are included in the zip file (along with a readme file). However, here's a quick overlook:
<br /><br />66 materials commented out in Jafo's PAK were in fact good.
<br />53 materials in Jafo's PAK were in fact broken.
<br />These materials were uncommented/commented out accordingly.
<br /><br />But the main difference lies in the fact tht this new PAK has 193 new TGA's to provide for qer_editorimages that were either missing or did not adequately depict what the texture really looks like in the game. Some of you who are currently designing maps in DoomEdit may think this PAK is just eye candy. If so, then consider these figures (compiled at the end of this project):
<br /><br />//=========== Global textures/_ materials stats==============
<br />// 
<br />// Total # of textures/_ materials : 3708 
<br />// Total # of working shaders: 1950 (approx. 52.5%) 
<br />// Total # of Broken/CommentedOut shaders: 1614 (approx. 43.5%) 
<br />// Total # of shaders which can't be used for map texturing and kept by necessity: 144 (approx. 4%) 
<br />//==============================================
<br /><br />Now I noticed that many of the materials in the original .mtr files can be misleading. Those may seem to be working but are really broken because the material code calls for a single non-existent TGA. The result is a texture that will display on your brush/patch in the game but won't look right (for eg. a material in which only the specularmap parameter refers to a TGA file that doesn't exist while the bump and diffuse map TGA's <span style="font-weight: bold">do</span> exist).
<br /><br />That means there's a significant chance that you might unknowingly be using broken materials to texture your map's geometry. So this PAK not only improves the look and ease of use of DoomEdit's texture window, it also ensures that you use <span style="font-weight: bold">only</span> 100% working materials to texture your maps.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.pcgamemods.com/9082/" class="postlink">DoomEdit CleanMaterials Version 5</a>
<br />(approx 13MB download)
<br /><br />Notes:
<br />- Version 2 has fix for qer_mirror texture appearing on mirrors in game.
<br />- Version 3 fixes the demon spawndecal not appearing in game.
<br />- Version 4 adds the 6 new materials in the V1.1 game patch plus a cosmetic issue with the editorimage textures/editor/redge.tga. Please note that these new materials are not meant to be used for map texturing. They were added so that my PAK won't break the new chat and lag icons in the V1.1 patched game when playing in MP mode. That's the ONLY real change in the V4 CleanMats.
<br />- Version 5 is the final cleanup phase. All the remaining materials have now been cleaned up (models, light, fog, fx's, gui's, particles, etc.). I also improved the qer_editorimage for model based entities in CAM view while in skinned mode. Most monsters/NPC's displayed their displacement map as the editorimage by default. Static models often used their addblend map by default (which made them appear pitch black). Most now use the _local bumpmap which improves visibility and clarity in skinned mode.
<br /><br />- There are no new TGA files in this pak so it's the same size as the last version.
<br /><br />A few broken materials for the sentry character reside in the sentry.def file so you need to download my latest Clean def's PAK to make this 100% complete. Please check the "Editing resources" sticky post in this forum for the URL of the "Clean def's" thread
<br /><br />PS: Mods please update links in other posts to point to this one (if required). Thanks.

<br /><br />One thing I have been wondering is this. 
<br /><br />How will maps using this pack work on a clean (non-development) install of D3. In Q3A there where several special textures provided with GTKradiant editing, that where not part of the clean retail install, thus missing on those machines.
<br /><br />I guess all the preview images you created from scratch will not be the problem, since these are editor only.

<br /><br />Absolutely not. That would have been the worst thing to do and I made it a point to never do that. All the shaders' code were left intact and original. My goal was not to "repair" anything. My goal was simply to sort out which materials really work and which ones don't work. The ones that don't work were commented out, the ones that DO work were left untouched except for the qer_editorimage to improve how it looks in the Texture window. And that's all there is to it.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p51119" date="Posted: Fri Sep 17, 2004 3:48 pm "><author>Brain Trepaning</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks a lot, this will be very helpful for many mappers.

<br /><br />You're very welcome. About the textures/common/mirror material, I found the reason why. Here's the material code:
<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">textures/common/mirror<br />{<br />   discrete      // never merge with other surfaces<br />   qer_editorimage textures/common/qer_mirror.tga<br />   solid<br />   mirror<br />   {<br />      blend add<br />      map textures/common/qer_mirror.tga<br />   }<br />}</div>
<br /><br />The TGA file "textures/common/qer_mirror.tga" is not present in the original game's pak004.pk4 , therefore you don't get this problem in the original game. The problem with this material is that that TGA image is used as a blendmap in the original code. It's not the qer_editorimage that causes this but the blend add stage.
<br /><br />Incidentally, I didn't create this image, my predecessor did. But ultimately it's my fault. I didn't test the textures/common materials thoroughly enough assuming there couldn't be anything wrong about those since they're so simple and straighforward.
<br /><br />I will fix that by renaming the qer_mirror.tga to something else and edit the qer_editorimage line to point to the renamed image instead. I won't change the blend add stage of course - the idea is that it must NOT find the TGA file it points to. The shader probably needs a blend add stage pointing to an inexistent texture to work properly (at least that's what I'm guessing). In any case, I musn't change the original shader code, I have to work around it.
<br /><br />The only downside is that you will get a "warning: textures/common/qer_mirror.tga not found" message when you load the material in the editor. But you won't see a "mirror" texture in your compiled maps anymore.
<br /><br />Oh well.... that's why I gave that editing pack Version numbers. Thanks for pointing out the booboo Docgalad. I will test all the textures/common materials throroughly this time and post a Version 2 ASAP.
<br /><br />UPDATE:
<br /><br />I checked all the textures/common and textures/editor materials in a compiled map and they all work. I uploaded the fixed Version 2 and updated the link in the top post.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p51379" date="Posted: Sat Sep 18, 2004 9:52 am "><author>indianajonesilm</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">WOW!!!!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilie" /><!--

I won't print the complete stats here since those are included in the zip file (along with a readme file). However, here's a quick overlook:&#13;<br /><br />66 materials commented out in Jafo's PAK were in fact good.&#13;<br />53 materials in Jafo's PAK were in fact broken.&#13;<br />These materials were uncommented/commented out accordingly.&#13;<br /><br />But the main difference lies in the fact tht this new PAK has 193 new TGA's to provide for qer_editorimages that were either missing or did not adequately depict what the texture really looks like in the game. Some of you who are currently designing maps in DoomEdit may think this PAK is just eye candy. If so, then consider these figures (compiled at the end of this project):&#13;<br /><br />//=========== Global textures/_ materials stats==============&#13;<br />// &#13;<br />// Total # of textures/_ materials : 3708 &#13;<br />// Total # of working shaders: 1950 (approx. 52.5%) &#13;<br />// Total # of Broken/CommentedOut shaders: 1614 (approx. 43.5%) &#13;<br />// Total # of shaders which can't be used for map texturing and kept by necessity: 144 (approx. 4%) &#13;<br />//==============================================&#13;<br /><br />Now I noticed that many of the materials in the original .mtr files can be misleading. Those may seem to be working but are really broken because the material code calls for a single non-existent TGA. The result is a texture that will display on your brush/patch in the game but won't look right (for eg. a material in which only the specularmap parameter refers to a TGA file that doesn't exist while the bump and diffuse map TGA's <span style="font-weight: bold">do</span> exist).&#13;<br /><br />That means there's a significant chance that you might unknowingly be using broken materials to texture your map's geometry. So this PAK not only improves the look and ease of use of DoomEdit's texture window, it also ensures that you use <span style="font-weight: bold">only</span> 100% working materials to texture your maps.&#13;<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.pcgamemods.com/9082/" class="postlink">DoomEdit CleanMaterials Version 5</a>&#13;<br />(approx 13MB download)&#13;<br /><br />Notes:&#13;<br />- Version 2 has fix for qer_mirror texture appearing on mirrors in game.&#13;<br />- Version 3 fixes the demon spawndecal not appearing in game.&#13;<br />- Version 4 adds the 6 new materials in the V1.1 game patch plus a cosmetic issue with the editorimage textures/editor/redge.tga. Please note that these new materials are not meant to be used for map texturing. They were added so that my PAK won't break the new chat and lag icons in the V1.1 patched game when playing in MP mode. That's the ONLY real change in the V4 CleanMats.&#13;<br />- Version 5 is the final cleanup phase. All the remaining materials have now been cleaned up (models, light, fog, fx's, gui's, particles, etc.). I also improved the qer_editorimage for model based entities in CAM view while in skinned mode. Most monsters/NPC's displayed their displacement map as the editorimage by default. Static models often used their addblend map by default (which made them appear pitch black). Most now use the _local bumpmap which improves visibility and clarity in skinned mode.&#13;<br /><br />- There are no new TGA files in this pak so it's the same size as the last version.&#13;<br /><br />A few broken materials for the sentry character reside in the sentry.def file so you need to download my latest Clean def's PAK to make this 100% complete. Please check the "Editing resources" sticky post in this forum for the URL of the "Clean def's" thread&#13;<br /><br />PS: Mods please update links in other posts to point to this one (if required). Thanks.&#13;<br /><span style="color: orange">[EDIT]new url. kat</span></div>]]></body></post><post id="p50905" date="Posted: Thu Sep 16, 2004 10:08 pm "><author>zeh</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=6012">http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=6012</a><!-- m -->&#13;<br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p50908" date="Posted: Thu Sep 16, 2004 10:14 pm "><author>Eutectic</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Oops... missed that completely.

I will test all the textures/common materials throroughly this time and post a Version 2 ASAP.&#13;<br /><br />UPDATE:&#13;<br /><br />I checked all the textures/common and textures/editor materials in a compiled map and they all work. I uploaded the fixed Version 2 and updated the link in the top post.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p51379" date="Posted: Sat Sep 18, 2004 9:52 am "><author>indianajonesilm</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">WOW!!!!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br />I would just like to say THANK YOU to all involved in making this.

						<div class="postbody">[EDIT] New URL&#13;<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.pcgamemods.com/mod/9082.html">http://www.pcgamemods.com/mod/9082.html</a><!-- m -->&#13;<br /><br />==============================&#13;<br /><br />It's done.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />This is a follow-up of Jafo's d3weditor clean shaders/materials pk4 file which served as a starting base for this new PAK. I won't print the complete stats here since those are included in the zip file (along with a readme file). However, here's a quick overlook:&#13;<br /><br />66 materials commented out in Jafo's PAK were in fact good.&#13;<br />53 materials in Jafo's PAK were in fact broken.&#13;<br />These materials were uncommented/commented out accordingly.&#13;<br /><br />But the main difference lies in the fact tht this new PAK has 193 new TGA's to provide for qer_editorimages that were either missing or did not adequately depict what the texture really looks like in the game. Some of you who are currently designing maps in DoomEdit may think this PAK is just eye candy. If so, then consider these figures (compiled at the end of this project):&#13;<br /><br />//=========== Global textures/_ materials stats==============&#13;<br />// &#13;<br />// Total # of textures/_ materials : 3708 &#13;<br />// Total # of working shaders: 1950 (approx. 52.5%) &#13;<br />// Total # of Broken/CommentedOut shaders: 1614 (approx. 43.5%) &#13;<br />// Total # of shaders which can't be used for map texturing and kept by necessity: 144 (approx. 4%) &#13;<br />//==============================================&#13;<br /><br />Now I noticed that many of the materials in the original .mtr files can be misleading. Those may seem to be working but are really broken because the material code calls for a single non-existent TGA. The result is a texture that will display on your brush/patch in the game but won't look right (for eg. a material in which only the specularmap parameter refers to a TGA file that doesn't exist while the bump and diffuse map TGA's <span style="font-weight: bold">do</span> exist).&#13;<br /><br />That means there's a significant chance that you might unknowingly be using broken materials to texture your map's geometry. So this PAK not only improves the look and ease of use of DoomEdit's texture window, it also ensures that you use <span style="font-weight: bold">only</span> 100% working materials to texture your maps.&#13;<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.pcgamemods.com/9082/" class="postlink">DoomEdit CleanMaterials Version 5</a>&#13;<br />(approx 13MB download)&#13;<br /><br />Notes:&#13;<br />- Version 2 has fix for qer_mirror texture appearing on mirrors in game.&#13;<br />- Version 3 fixes the demon spawndecal not appearing in game.&#13;<br />- Version 4 adds the 6 new materials in the V1.1 game patch plus a cosmetic issue with the editorimage textures/editor/redge.tga. Please note that these new materials are not meant to be used for map texturing. They were added so that my PAK won't break the new chat and lag icons in the V1.1 patched game when playing in MP mode. That's the ONLY real change in the V4 CleanMats.&#13;<br />- Version 5 is the final cleanup phase. All the remaining materials have now been cleaned up (models, light, fog, fx's, gui's, particles, etc.). I also improved the qer_editorimage for model based entities in CAM view while in skinned mode. Most monsters/NPC's displayed their displacement map as the editorimage by default. Static models often used their addblend map by default (which made them appear pitch black). Most now use the _local bumpmap which improves visibility and clarity in skinned mode.&#13;<br /><br />- There are no new TGA files in this pak so it's the same size as the last version.&#13;<br /><br />A few broken materials for the sentry character reside in the sentry.def file so you need to download my latest Clean def's PAK to make this 100% complete. Please check the "Editing resources" sticky post in this forum for the URL of the "Clean def's" thread&#13;<br /><br />PS: Mods please update links in other posts to point to this one (if required). Thanks.&#13;<br /><span style="color: orange">[EDIT]new url. kat</span></div>

						<div class="postbody">Eutectic,&#13;<br />first off wonderful job...&#13;<br /><br />One thing I have been wondering is this. &#13;<br /><br />How will maps using this pack work on a clean (non-development) install of D3. In Q3A there where several special textures provided with GTKradiant editing, that where not part of the clean retail install, thus missing on those machines.&#13;<br /><br />I guess all the preview images you created from scratch will not be the problem, since these are editor only. But did some of the shaders e.g. have to be changed to differ from the originals?</div>

						<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">AEon wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Eutectic,<br />first off wonderful job...<br /><br />One thing I have been wondering is this. <br /><br />How will maps using this pack work on a clean (non-development) install of D3. In Q3A there where several special textures provided with GTKradiant editing, that where not part of the clean retail install, thus missing on those machines.</div><br /><br />Thanks <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Maps made while having this PAK enabled will work just fine in the standard plain-jane Doom3 game. I did not add any new shaders/materials in the mtr files. All I (and Jafo) did was to comment out the broken materials so they don't get parsed by the editor, that's all.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I guess all the preview images you created from scratch will not be the problem, since these are editor only.</div><br /><br />That's right. The TGA file that the qer_editorimage parameter points to affects only what you see in the editor's texture window and in the CAM view. It has no effect on the the material in the game itself.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">But did some of the shaders e.g. have to be changed to differ from the originals?</div>&#13;<br /><br />Absolutely not. That would have been the worst thing to do and I made it a point to never do that. All the shaders' code were left intact and original. My goal was not to "repair" anything. My goal was simply to sort out which materials really work and which ones don't work. The ones that don't work were commented out, the ones that DO work were left untouched except for the qer_editorimage to improve how it looks in the Texture window. And that's all there is to it.</div>

						<div class="postbody">Question:&#13;<br /><br />I have D3 completely unpacked for mapping purposes.  I downloaded the pk4 and put it into base, but the editor is not reading it.&#13;<br /><br />Is it true that the editor cannot mix unpacked with packed?  I ran into this same problem with .def files (I had D3 packed and it wasn't reading my custom .def files, which is what prompted me to unpack them in the first place).  Once I had unpacked the D3 files, my own def files read fine.  It seems like I've hit this issue again.&#13;<br /><br />So bascially the question is, do I have to unpack the clean materials in my unpacked directory for them to read?&#13;<br /><br />Ron</div>

So i have to disable ZZ-xxx.pk4 to see the final map properly. <br /><br />A huge *thank you* for the massive work achieved. <br />I can imagine the task, so many notepad openings.<br /><br />Cheers.</div>&#13;<br /><br />You're very welcome. About the textures/common/mirror material, I found the reason why. Here's the material code:&#13;<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">textures/common/mirror<br />{<br />   discrete      // never merge with other surfaces<br />   qer_editorimage textures/common/qer_mirror.tga<br />   solid<br />   mirror<br />   {<br />      blend add<br />      map textures/common/qer_mirror.tga<br />   }<br />}</div>&#13;<br /><br />The TGA file "textures/common/qer_mirror.tga" is not present in the original game's pak004.pk4 , therefore you don't get this problem in the original game. The problem with this material is that that TGA image is used as a blendmap in the original code. It's not the qer_editorimage that causes this but the blend add stage.&#13;<br /><br />Incidentally, I didn't create this image, my predecessor did. But ultimately it's my fault. I didn't test the textures/common materials thoroughly enough assuming there couldn't be anything wrong about those since they're so simple and straighforward.&#13;<br /><br />I will fix that by renaming the qer_mirror.tga to something else and edit the qer_editorimage line to point to the renamed image instead. I won't change the blend add stage of course - the idea is that it must NOT find the TGA file it points to. The shader probably needs a blend add stage pointing to an inexistent texture to work properly (at least that's what I'm guessing). In any case, I musn't change the original shader code, I have to work around it.&#13;<br /><br />The only downside is that you will get a "warning: textures/common/qer_mirror.tga not found" message when you load the material in the editor. But you won't see a "mirror" texture in your compiled maps anymore.&#13;<br /><br />Oh well.... that's why I gave that editing pack Version numbers. Thanks for pointing out the booboo Docgalad. I will test all the textures/common materials throroughly this time and post a Version 2 ASAP.&#13;<br /><br />UPDATE:&#13;<br /><br />I checked all the textures/common and textures/editor materials in a compiled map and they all work. I uploaded the fixed Version 2 and updated the link in the top post.</div>

<br /><br />==============================
<br /><br />It's done.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />This is a follow-up of Jafo's d3weditor clean shaders/materials pk4 file which served as a starting base for this new PAK. I won't print the complete stats here since those are included in the zip file (along with a readme file). However, here's a quick overlook:
<br /><br />66 materials commented out in Jafo's PAK were in fact good.
<br />53 materials in Jafo's PAK were in fact broken.
<br />These materials were uncommented/commented out accordingly.
<br /><br />But the main difference lies in the fact tht this new PAK has 193 new TGA's to provide for qer_editorimages that were either missing or did not adequately depict what the texture really looks like in the game. Some of you who are currently designing maps in DoomEdit may think this PAK is just eye candy. If so, then consider these figures (compiled at the end of this project):
<br /><br />//=========== Global textures/_ materials stats==============
<br />// 
<br />// Total # of textures/_ materials : 3708 
<br />// Total # of working shaders: 1950 (approx. 52.5%) 
<br />// Total # of Broken/CommentedOut shaders: 1614 (approx. 43.5%) 
<br />// Total # of shaders which can't be used for map texturing and kept by necessity: 144 (approx. 4%) 
<br />//==============================================
<br /><br />Now I noticed that many of the materials in the original .mtr files can be misleading. Those may seem to be working but are really broken because the material code calls for a single non-existent TGA. The result is a texture that will display on your brush/patch in the game but won't look right (for eg. a material in which only the specularmap parameter refers to a TGA file that doesn't exist while the bump and diffuse map TGA's <span style="font-weight: bold">do</span> exist).
<br /><br />That means there's a significant chance that you might unknowingly be using broken materials to texture your map's geometry. So this PAK not only improves the look and ease of use of DoomEdit's texture window, it also ensures that you use <span style="font-weight: bold">only</span> 100% working materials to texture your maps.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.pcgamemods.com/9082/" class="postlink">DoomEdit CleanMaterials Version 5</a>
<br />(approx 13MB download)
<br /><br />Notes:
<br />- Version 2 has fix for qer_mirror texture appearing on mirrors in game.
<br />- Version 3 fixes the demon spawndecal not appearing in game.
<br />- Version 4 adds the 6 new materials in the V1.1 game patch plus a cosmetic issue with the editorimage textures/editor/redge.tga. Please note that these new materials are not meant to be used for map texturing. They were added so that my PAK won't break the new chat and lag icons in the V1.1 patched game when playing in MP mode. That's the ONLY real change in the V4 CleanMats.
<br />- Version 5 is the final cleanup phase. All the remaining materials have now been cleaned up (models, light, fog, fx's, gui's, particles, etc.). I also improved the qer_editorimage for model based entities in CAM view while in skinned mode. Most monsters/NPC's displayed their displacement map as the editorimage by default. Static models often used their addblend map by default (which made them appear pitch black). Most now use the _local bumpmap which improves visibility and clarity in skinned mode.
<br /><br />- There are no new TGA files in this pak so it's the same size as the last version.
<br /><br />A few broken materials for the sentry character reside in the sentry.def file so you need to download my latest Clean def's PAK to make this 100% complete. Please check the "Editing resources" sticky post in this forum for the URL of the "Clean def's" thread
<br /><br />PS: Mods please update links in other posts to point to this one (if required). Thanks.

I did not add any new shaders/materials in the mtr files. All I (and Jafo) did was to comment out the broken materials so they don't get parsed by the editor, that's all.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I guess all the preview images you created from scratch will not be the problem, since these are editor only.</div><br /><br />That's right. The TGA file that the qer_editorimage parameter points to affects only what you see in the editor's texture window and in the CAM view.

<br /><br />Absolutely not. That would have been the worst thing to do and I made it a point to never do that. All the shaders' code were left intact and original. My goal was not to "repair" anything. My goal was simply to sort out which materials really work and which ones don't work. The ones that don't work were commented out, the ones that DO work were left untouched except for the qer_editorimage to improve how it looks in the Texture window. And that's all there is to it.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p51119" date="Posted: Fri Sep 17, 2004 3:48 pm "><author>Brain Trepaning</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks a lot, this will be very helpful for many mappers.

<br /><br />I have D3 completely unpacked for mapping purposes.  I downloaded the pk4 and put it into base, but the editor is not reading it.
<br /><br />Is it true that the editor cannot mix unpacked with packed?  I ran into this same problem with .def files (I had D3 packed and it wasn't reading my custom .def files, which is what prompted me to unpack them in the first place).  Once I had unpacked the D3 files, my own def files read fine.  It seems like I've hit this issue again.
<br /><br />So bascially the question is, do I have to unpack the clean materials in my unpacked directory for them to read?

<br /><br />You're very welcome. About the textures/common/mirror material, I found the reason why. Here's the material code:
<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">textures/common/mirror<br />{<br />   discrete      // never merge with other surfaces<br />   qer_editorimage textures/common/qer_mirror.tga<br />   solid<br />   mirror<br />   {<br />      blend add<br />      map textures/common/qer_mirror.tga<br />   }<br />}</div>
<br /><br />The TGA file "textures/common/qer_mirror.tga" is not present in the original game's pak004.pk4 , therefore you don't get this problem in the original game. The problem with this material is that that TGA image is used as a blendmap in the original code. It's not the qer_editorimage that causes this but the blend add stage.
<br /><br />Incidentally, I didn't create this image, my predecessor did. But ultimately it's my fault. I didn't test the textures/common materials thoroughly enough assuming there couldn't be anything wrong about those since they're so simple and straighforward.
<br /><br />I will fix that by renaming the qer_mirror.tga to something else and edit the qer_editorimage line to point to the renamed image instead. I won't change the blend add stage of course - the idea is that it must NOT find the TGA file it points to. The shader probably needs a blend add stage pointing to an inexistent texture to work properly (at least that's what I'm guessing). In any case, I musn't change the original shader code, I have to work around it.
<br /><br />The only downside is that you will get a "warning: textures/common/qer_mirror.tga not found" message when you load the material in the editor. But you won't see a "mirror" texture in your compiled maps anymore.
<br /><br />Oh well.... that's why I gave that editing pack Version numbers. Thanks for pointing out the booboo Docgalad. I will test all the textures/common materials throroughly this time and post a Version 2 ASAP.
<br /><br />UPDATE:
<br /><br />I checked all the textures/common and textures/editor materials in a compiled map and they all work. I uploaded the fixed Version 2 and updated the link in the top post.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p51379" date="Posted: Sat Sep 18, 2004 9:52 am "><author>indianajonesilm</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">WOW!!!!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilie" /><!--

<br /><br />Not in this case it isn't. I examined every single hit from this query and they all link to the old pcgamemods url, which is obviously out of date since the file isn't there.

I won't print the complete stats here since those are included in the zip file (along with a readme file). However, here's a quick overlook:<br /><br />66 materials commented out in Jafo's PAK were in fact good.<br />53 materials in Jafo's PAK were in fact broken.<br />These materials were uncommented/commented out accordingly.<br /><br />But the main difference lies in the fact tht this new PAK has 193 new TGA's to provide for qer_editorimages that were either missing or did not adequately depict what the texture really looks like in the game. Some of you who are currently designing maps in DoomEdit may think this PAK is just eye candy. If so, then consider these figures (compiled at the end of this project):<br /><br />//=========== Global textures/_ materials stats==============<br />// <br />// Total # of textures/_ materials : 3708 <br />// Total # of working shaders: 1950 (approx. 52.5%) <br />// Total # of Broken/CommentedOut shaders: 1614 (approx. 43.5%) <br />// Total # of shaders which can't be used for map texturing and kept by necessity: 144 (approx. 4%) <br />//==============================================<br /><br />Now I noticed that many of the materials in the original .mtr files can be misleading. Those may seem to be working but are really broken because the material code calls for a single non-existent TGA. The result is a texture that will display on your brush/patch in the game but won't look right (for eg. a material in which only the specularmap parameter refers to a TGA file that doesn't exist while the bump and diffuse map TGA's <span style="font-weight: bold">do</span> exist).<br /><br />That means there's a significant chance that you might unknowingly be using broken materials to texture your map's geometry. So this PAK not only improves the look and ease of use of DoomEdit's texture window, it also ensures that you use <span style="font-weight: bold">only</span> 100% working materials to texture your maps.<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111120051511/http://www.pcgamemods.com/9082/" class="postlink">DoomEdit CleanMaterials Version 5</a><br />(approx 13MB download)<br /><br />Notes:<br />- Version 2 has fix for qer_mirror texture appearing on mirrors in game.<br />- Version 3 fixes the demon spawndecal not appearing in game.<br />- Version 4 adds the 6 new materials in the V1.1 game patch plus a cosmetic issue with the editorimage textures/editor/redge.tga. Please note that these new materials are not meant to be used for map texturing. They were added so that my PAK won't break the new chat and lag icons in the V1.1 patched game when playing in MP mode. That's the ONLY real change in the V4 CleanMats.<br />- Version 5 is the final cleanup phase. All the remaining materials have now been cleaned up (models, light, fog, fx's, gui's, particles, etc.). I also improved the qer_editorimage for model based entities in CAM view while in skinned mode. Most monsters/NPC's displayed their displacement map as the editorimage by default. Static models often used their addblend map by default (which made them appear pitch black). Most now use the _local bumpmap which improves visibility and clarity in skinned mode.<br /><br />- There are no new TGA files in this pak so it's the same size as the last version.<br /><br />A few broken materials for the sentry character reside in the sentry.def file so you need to download my latest Clean def's PAK to make this 100% complete. Please check the "Editing resources" sticky post in this forum for the URL of the "Clean def's" thread<br /><br />PS: Mods please update links in other posts to point to this one (if required).

I did not add any new shaders/materials in the mtr files. All I (and Jafo) did was to comment out the broken materials so they don't get parsed by the editor, that's all.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I guess all the preview images you created from scratch will not be the problem, since these are editor only.</div><br /><br />That's right. The TGA file that the qer_editorimage parameter points to affects only what you see in the editor's texture window and in the CAM view.

<br /><br />Absolutely not. That would have been the worst thing to do and I made it a point to never do that. All the shaders' code were left intact and original. My goal was not to "repair" anything. My goal was simply to sort out which materials really work and which ones don't work. The ones that don't work were commented out, the ones that DO work were left untouched except for the qer_editorimage to improve how it looks in the Texture window. And that's all there is to it.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p51119" date="Posted: Fri Sep 17, 2004 3:48 pm "><author>Brain Trepaning</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks a lot, this will be very helpful for many mappers.

<br /><br />Is it true that the editor cannot mix unpacked with packed?  I ran into this same problem with .def files (I had D3 packed and it wasn't reading my custom .def files, which is what prompted me to unpack them in the first place).  Once I had unpacked the D3 files, my own def files read fine.  It seems like I've hit this issue again.

<br /><br />You're very welcome. About the textures/common/mirror material, I found the reason why. Here's the material code:
<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">textures/common/mirror<br />{<br />   discrete      // never merge with other surfaces<br />   qer_editorimage textures/common/qer_mirror.tga<br />   solid<br />   mirror<br />   {<br />      blend add<br />      map textures/common/qer_mirror.tga<br />   }<br />}</div>
<br /><br />The TGA file "textures/common/qer_mirror.tga" is not present in the original game's pak004.pk4 , therefore you don't get this problem in the original game. The problem with this material is that that TGA image is used as a blendmap in the original code. It's not the qer_editorimage that causes this but the blend add stage.
<br /><br />Incidentally, I didn't create this image, my predecessor did. But ultimately it's my fault. I didn't test the textures/common materials thoroughly enough assuming there couldn't be anything wrong about those since they're so simple and straighforward.
<br /><br />I will fix that by renaming the qer_mirror.tga to something else and edit the qer_editorimage line to point to the renamed image instead. I won't change the blend add stage of course - the idea is that it must NOT find the TGA file it points to. The shader probably needs a blend add stage pointing to an inexistent texture to work properly (at least that's what I'm guessing). In any case, I musn't change the original shader code, I have to work around it.
<br /><br />The only downside is that you will get a "warning: textures/common/qer_mirror.tga not found" message when you load the material in the editor. But you won't see a "mirror" texture in your compiled maps anymore.
<br /><br />Oh well.... that's why I gave that editing pack Version numbers. Thanks for pointing out the booboo Docgalad. I will test all the textures/common materials throroughly this time and post a Version 2 ASAP.
<br /><br />UPDATE:
<br /><br />I checked all the textures/common and textures/editor materials in a compiled map and they all work. I uploaded the fixed Version 2 and updated the link in the top post.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p51379" date="Posted: Sat Sep 18, 2004 9:52 am "><author>indianajonesilm</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">WOW!!!!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20111120051511im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br />I would just like to say THANK YOU to all involved in making this.
