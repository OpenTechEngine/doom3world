I've tweaked the stock Guardian boss map 3 hours before the dead-line, and got a lot of trouble with leaks, guardian cinematic entities and lights.<br />The right soulcude that is placed before the teleporter is also bugged, it appear with a wrong model. I've just placed it from the map editor, there is maybe something else to do...<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Kristus wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I was a bit miffed that your big imp boss doesn't actually do anything.</div>Me too, and in addition there is a bug about the pain animation.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Kristus wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">is it supposed to happen anything after you killed the big Imp?</div>Currently no, I will need to learn the basic of cinematics <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110527211853im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />The waves are currently very confusing, I think I should kill all alive minions (fire explosion ?) before spawning the next wave. The current waves are too similar, during beta test I've used waves of similar minions (melee waves, ranged waves ...) and it's probably more fun.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p210659" date="Posted: Sun Feb 01, 2009 11:09 am "><author>Kristus</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I liked that the waves were crazy like that.
