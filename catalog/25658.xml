The video is a year old now. Right now I have rebuilt all of the first main area.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121109024824/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLg37ZncpM&amp;feature=plcp">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLg37ZncpM&amp;feature=plcp</a><!-- m --> this is basically showing you what happened when you were away from the main facility. Unfortunately I lose all this scripting, but I still have all the assets to redo it again.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121109024824/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUkfTXXP6k&amp;feature=relmfu">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTUkfTXX ... ure=relmfu</a><!-- m --> this is the basement to the facility.<br /><br />So basically I've been wanting to get back to this map but with gaming and moving and so on it put a halt on all of that.<br /><br />But now I'm full steam ahead, I've even made a new texture pack which I am replacing all the textures in the level. So far I have 37 textures made and about 20 or so to go.<br /><br />Tomorrow I'll upload some shots with my new textures in.<br /><br />Thanks to Bladeghost for inspiring me to get my shit sorted out <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20121109024824im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p240381" date="Posted: Sun Jul 01, 2012 6:53 pm "><author>Sikkpin</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Good stuff.

Although give me till during the week to upload it and you can do that what you want with it.<br /><br />Ok so this is how I went about making the vision of the past type effect:<br /><br />- First off I prepared all the content. <br />- I made new materials for the NPCs using a custom fragment shader (very simple lum shader). then I made all the rest of the images transparent.<br />- Then I made skins for the affected NPCs<br />- Using the same fragment shader I trigger that as the influence with a swirly effect<br />- Then I just do a mass hide of the broken base stuff, unhide all the NPC's, trigger the influence effect, some audio, and what ever else. Once the effect is over I hide all that and unhide all the broken stuff again.<br /><br />It's not too complicated really, just a bunch of timings to get it right. Sadly I need to redo it all again, but shouldn't be too much effort.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p240398" date="Posted: Mon Jul 02, 2012 1:52 am "><author>bladeghost</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Nice stuff! thumbs up, ghost effect very cool! once you get going again it becomes theraputic modding <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20121109024824im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p240409" date="Posted: Mon Jul 02, 2012 9:29 am "><author>Tron</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Sweet work as always dude, I had a bit of a laugh at this part though:<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121109024824/http://imgur.com/KPw1X" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20121109024824im_/http://i.imgur.com/KPw1Xl.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br /><br />I know it's Doom 3 so pipes ahoy, but that one that loops out of the floor, over the walkway and then back into the floor is just especially "wtf was the engineer who designed this place thinking?!"</div>]]></body></post><post id="p240412" date="Posted: Mon Jul 02, 2012 10:31 am "><author>bkt</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Where have I seen this before <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20121109024824im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />Good to see you working on it again!

You know doom 3 doesn't like that.<br />Anyway, hope to see updates any time soon! <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20121109024824im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p240440" date="Posted: Tue Jul 03, 2012 2:46 am "><author>Zombie13</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Yes it's a dust particle I made that slowly moves around with some sun beams coming through the window.<br /><br />Yes it is an open map, but to be honest I am a bit of a snob when it comes to performance.
