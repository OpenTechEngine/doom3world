I also thought the joker was a great character ( that disappearing pencil trick was pretty funny in a sick way ). I'm only really talking about the story, but there's not really much to say about the rest of the film the special effects made cool looking car chases, the photography was flawless and the characters were pretty decent. <br /><br />I suppose the main thing is that the film kept true to the original comics/graphic novels.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p203169" date="Posted: Tue Aug 05, 2008 6:20 pm "><author>qwertz123</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">no, he kept true to US!

I agree it's very much a contender for movie of the year.  So dark and gritty, the way Batman should be.  I loved it.<br /><br />Heath's performance was quite the swan song, too.  I foresee copious posthumous awards given to him.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p202419" date="Posted: Mon Jul 21, 2008 7:38 pm "><author>Darkr0nin</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">It's a shame he died.

I also thought the joker was a great character ( that disappearing pencil trick was pretty funny in a sick way ). I'm only really talking about the story, but there's not really much to say about the rest of the film the special effects made cool looking car chases, the photography was flawless and the characters were pretty decent. <br /><br />I suppose the main thing is that the film kept true to the original comics/graphic novels.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p203169" date="Posted: Tue Aug 05, 2008 6:20 pm "><author>qwertz123</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">no, he kept true to US!

This movie is more character and story-driven, like Iron Man. There is only a mild amount of action in Dark Knight (that's not a bad thing <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081118091428im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /> )</div>]]></body></post></posts></thread></xml>
