<br /><br />Agree with sypher's comment, but saying that, I have a feeling if you did light it in purple it would look kind of gaudy.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p124182" date="Posted: Sun Dec 04, 2005 10:49 am "><author>idiom</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I really like the lighting.

<br /><br />Yep. With the help of Obi-Wan and Quaker-X, all Quake 1 weapons and power-ups are already in and working as intended.

Exellent!
<br /><br />I never was a fan of Quake 1 (couldn't stand the low-poly look), but that has only made me all the more interested in seeing what high-poly versions of the original weapons are gonna look like in a new engine.
<br /><br />Just out of curiosity, have you given the guns any "new" animations (that they didn't have in the original, such as reloading/cocking animations)? 'Cause that was one of my beefs with the original Quake  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_cry.gif" alt=":cry:" title="Crying or Very sad" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p124757" date="Posted: Thu Dec 08, 2005 6:33 pm "><author>heXum</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I posted another shot since everyone seems interested.

<br />very nostalgic and Quake1 feeling, but 10x better looking.
<br />i've been hoping someone would do some sort of Quake1 ports under the D3 engine that truely captured the Quake1 feel, theme, and style. I think its sweet cause Quake1 was my all time favorite game ever (well, besides the mod, Team Fortress). even tho i rarely play it anymore, i still love it.
<br /><br />but... please, please, PLEASE!  port it to Quake4!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_cry.gif" alt=":cry:" title="Crying or Very sad" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p124890" date="Posted: Fri Dec 09, 2005 6:47 pm "><author>Tron</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Why on earth would you want a Quake 4 version?
