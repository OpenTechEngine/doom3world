<br/><br/>
I've been working on this little mod of mine for a while now, and I'm now at the final stage.  Everything else works beautifully except for the Pistol Laser Sight.  I've been suggested many different avenues to solve this issue, but of all of them I'd say none of them make sense.&#13;
<br/><br/>
So, given that I have the Pistol model, and a special bone from which to eminate my "laser", I figure it would work similarly to the flash light method that I've used so far, but that method involves the use of three textures, a beam, a flare, and a bulb.  The laser is different than an actual <span style="font-style: italic">light</span> so I figure I must go back to the drawing board.  &#13;
<br/><br/>
One particular suggestion did seem to make a lot of sense, logically speaking, but effectually I haven't a clue how to do it.  The suggestion is a particle effect.  It was describe in one response to my many posts on this as </span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" border="0" align="center"><tr><td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>	</tr><tr><td class="quote">drawing the laser with a stream of particles</td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody"> but how do you do that?  Where would I go to learn about creating a particle effect that follows the same trace as the actual flashlight beam does?  What is a particle effect?  A Shader (material), texture, combination of both?  I truthfully don't know.  &#13;
<br/><br/>
Thanks&#13;

Well, yes, but I figure that I can either fake it...since well this is hollywood, not reality.  I mean if it was reality, we wouldn't have games that involved hellspawn demons and heinous possessive mutated monsters now would we.  *cheezygrin*&#13;
<br/><br/>
But in a smoke filled room, or with the right imperfection put on the emitter rod a Laser can actually illuminate a beam, which is the effect I want.  Nothing to hardcore, just pretty, (and hopefully with my code modifications, accurate.&#13;
<br/><br/>
I plan to use the code from the Light emission to calculate the trajectory of the projectiles, so that the laser dot is where the bullet ends up.  It'll take some work, but I know i can work it...as soon as i figure out these Particle effects.  *chuckle*&#13;

By any chance is there another place i could look to edit particles?  The reason being is that I can't seem to get the DoomED to load for that particular editor.  (no pun intended).  every time i run "editparticles" doom3 crashes.  &#13;
