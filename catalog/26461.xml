This will make life so much easier being able to get to all the files and searching for references/see how ID done it.<br /><br />To be honest until your pretty confident with knowing how all the files work together and have done lots of scripting, up untill the point youve found theres stuff you cant do with the above i wouldnt even worry about the SDK.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p246122" date="Posted: Sun Jan 13, 2013 7:25 pm "><author>CybrWb</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Yeah I'll leave SDK To the pros, thats a little over my head. For the hell of it I d/l SikkMod, as I understand it they did qute a bit of work on the textures and what not, Would I be correct in assuming that they used the cleanpaks to do that, if so I imagine I dont need BOTH Sikkmod AND the cleanpaks. As for the rest.<br /><br /><br />1. Cleanpaks &lt;--Done and Done.<br />2. A decent text editor with line numbers and the option for syntax highlighting. UltraEdit, Notepad++ etc &lt;--- I got ConTEXT<br />3. A grep tool. WindowsGrep &lt;--- Ok.<br />4. Some kind of image editor. Gimp, Photoshop &lt;--- Will do.<br />5. A modeling program. Blender, Max &lt;--- I have Blender but I dont see .lwo as supported under Import. perhaps I'll try 3dMax<br />6. Maybe a sound editing program. Audacitiy &lt;--- I'll worry bout that when I get there.<br />7. A link to ModWiki or the CHM help file and ID's info page. &lt;-- It' my understanding that ModWiki is still down, can't wait though.<br /><br />Oh and what are your thoughts on me downloading a Grep tool? Just curious.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320010448im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320010448im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320010448im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /></div>]]></body></post></posts></thread></xml>
