<br /><br />Fist off, create a map. Once you have a basic room ready, right click and hit "New model". Browse to <span style="font-weight: bold">base/models/mapobjects/arcade_machine</span> and choose <span style="font-weight: bold">arcade_machine.lwo</span>. Now, go to your new arcade machines properties. Select at the bottom <span style="font-weight: bold">"Gui"</span>, and browse to <span style="font-weight: bold">base/guis/marscity/</span> and select <span style="font-weight: bold">sttp.gui</span>. There you go! You're done. Uh congradulations, compile your map and smash those damn turkeys! Dont feel gulity. They had it coming.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p29324" date="Posted: Fri Aug 06, 2004 8:05 am "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks - this could also read :
