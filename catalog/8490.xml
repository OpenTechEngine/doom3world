<br /><br />Seneca Menard modelled all those characters in Lightwave..And he export it to MAYA..Then they made the animations in maya ...( he is even saying modelling the Cyberdemon took his 4 weeks)
<br /><br />this is why im asking..what is that exporting tool...between Lightwave and MAya.(deep exploration or custom plugin or Polytans.)

I can't really remember any place where this question is answered, so you probably save time sending a mail to Brian on <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.iddevnet.com/">http://www.iddevnet.com</a><!-- w -->  I'm really sure he would answer those question to the community. Let me know, I'm really curious..
<br /><br /><br /><br />Ps: can you explain why .obj support is not enough?  when you import it in maya, you can make what you want with it, or am I wrong?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p73787" date="Posted: Mon Jan 24, 2005 3:11 pm "><author>rich_is_bored</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Lightwave does a poor job when it comes to exporting OBJ format.
<br /><br />The only thing exported is geometry so UV maps and bones are disgarded.
<br /><br />Of course, this is only a concern if you aren't able to UV map or rig a model in Maya.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p73978" date="Posted: Tue Jan 25, 2005 12:45 pm "><author>TYROT</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">dear DOOM3 community
<br /><br />YES!!! YES!!!! they have answered...Ok here is the deal..
<br />They are converting character meshes from Lightwave to MAYA  with DEEP EXPLORATION. either OBJ or MB format..Mostly MB..So guys..This is the ID way..
<br /><br />My goodness they are really HELPFUL!
