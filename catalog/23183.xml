The rest can be the same... (wolf has nazi with occult technology.. quakewars has high technology.. almost the same) <br />vehicles will be disabled throug cvar<br /><br />Need to model a thomson and a mp40 (in a hour i think a skilled modeller can do it)<br />Put new clothes to existing human ragdolls to mark different sides (axis and allies)<br /><br />Tweak the physic of the game like was done in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320003200/http://community.enemyterritory.com/forums/showpost.php?p=478127&amp;postcount=22" class="postlink">this mod</a>  Obviously this mod is an example that proofs that quake wars can have same physic of id tech 3 or very similar..<br />(i tested it.. it's incredible fast and really similar to q3)<br /><br />I don't think this is impossible to act <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320003200im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" alt=":|" title="Neutral" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p219240" date="Posted: Tue Oct 06, 2009 10:11 am "><author>parsonsbear</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Not impossible at all, and there's a lot of highly motivated RTCW fans out there right now possibly willing to help- however it's hard to overstate what a huge undertaking this will be.

What i meant is that maybe ETQW and Enemy Territory's gameplay dont share many commonalities.  Or do they? I havent played ETQW that much.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p219972" date="Posted: Thu Oct 29, 2009 3:36 am "><author>Nancy08</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Seriously, 9 years is too long. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320003200im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /><br /><br />“Games lubricate the body and the mind.”</div>]]></body></post><post id="p219979" date="Posted: Thu Oct 29, 2009 11:40 am "><author>=FF=Sturm</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Nancy08 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Seriously, 9 years is too long. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320003200im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /><br /><br />“Games lubricate the body and the mind.”</div><br />...And the developer's ass while they are raping themselves"</div>]]></body></post></posts></thread></xml>
