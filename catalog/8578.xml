It just saddens me to see these 2 sentence postings where someone is asking for talented people to dedicate their time to a mod that he obviously doesn't have a clear picture of yet, and where it's unclear if it was just a spontaneous idea or has ripened over some days atleast.
<br />Maybe these hints are worth a sticky in this subforum.
<br />Some ideas for such a sticky:
<br />- try to impress people with your idea, show them that your mod is something special
<br />- post screenshots or concept arts if you have any
<br />- post a story
<br />- post something about yourself: previous work, your age (I consider that really important), where you get your inspiration from
<br />- post some basic project schedule/workload estimations
<br />- try to use understandable english in your post. Typos are not really catastrophical, but they WILL make your post look unpolished and your request won't be taken as serious as it would otherwise. You want to attract people, not show them your incompetence.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p103104" date="Posted: Sat Jul 09, 2005 5:02 am "><author>kat</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">In addition to 'requests', 'replies' should also be equally informative where possible.
