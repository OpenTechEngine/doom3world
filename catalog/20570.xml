I'm always disappointed when games take 10 hours or less (for a 50 euros/dollars title) so there was no way I'd get one that only lasts 5, even if you give the proper internet comment discount.<br /><br />But still, I had liked the demo so a couple of days ago when I saw the game for 20 euros I picked it up. First the bad news, yes the game is awfully short. When I reached the end the game's saves clocked it a hair above the 6 hour mark which jives with my own external counter (6 and a half). I finished the game in two sittings, in the hard difficulty setting, looking at every niche, listening to every radio broadcast, playing with all the arcade machines and even wasting time admiring the level design - and I admired at lot.<br /><br />Even at hard difficulty, the game is very easy because the developers thought the whole "fight the spirits" mini-game was a good alternative to dying. Not only does it rob the whole fear of death thing, it also becomes quite annoying in the second half of the game. Something that didn't become apparent when I played the demo last year.<br /><br />On the positive side, I really enjoyed the fire-fights especially when they were combined with the gravity/portal puzzles with very good use of the 3rd dimension which was surprising since the game also shipped for the xbox 360. The spirit powers were refreshing though they do start to repeat a bit in the last few levels. Even the story was interesting. The radio show and all the small bits of Earth that you encounter really ground you (ha!) into the fantasy of being on an alien ship. It was also downright creepy at times,  with the part with the school bus freaking me out a bit.<br /><br />The art design was masterful. I saw comments that the levels get repetitive with all the game metal textures everywhere but this isn't true in the slightest. The organic sets, the moving machinery, the open areas really do provide variety (as an aside I don't know why more people don't complain that 90% of FarCry is spent in the same god damned jungle). The level design is, the best I've seen on DOOM 3 engine (or similar) technology. The use of lights, curves, particle effects is brilliant. Audio design is top notch too and bonus points for the use of recognizable sound tracks.<br /><br />There aren't too many different alien races, but those that exist have enough variety to keep things interesting and the A.I. is reasonable. The weapons are satisfying and the player physics are solid (based on an id Software engine, these are not surprising). The puzzles are interesting but I wanted more, especially physics ones.<br /><br />The multiplayer was an afterthough, wait... it looks like an afterthought but it's even worse. I had played it with the demo last year and I still liked it but it was clear it wasn't going anywhere.<br /><br />All in all, it's a great game and it's a really good FPS but on hindsight I'm very happy with my decision to wait until I could get it for what I did. For me, it's definitely NOT worth 30 euros, let alone 50. So if anyone out there also passed on the game the first time around and can find it for a similar price I recommend it.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p189115" date="Posted: Wed Sep 26, 2007 3:48 am "><author>The Happy Friar</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I bought the tin box for $20 a while back (right next to it was the non-tin for $50!

It's fun, has an interesting story, beautiful design, my only complaint would be that it was too short. Even with it being short, it's forgivible on account of the content, when I got it I just could'nt put it down for a good month I replayed it four times. I recently got a new video card and I can play it on high quality now, and honestly I have'nt seen a better looking game yet.<br /><br />One thing that makes me sad is the lack of an MP community. I played Prey deathmatch religiously until for some reason or another people just stopped playing. The multiplayer really breathed new life into a tired old Deathmatch model with the spirit walking, and wall walking, you really had to be on your toes your enemy could be anywhere, on the ceiling, the walls. One dissapointment for me was that you could'nt rocket jump and you when you were wall walking it would'nt allow to jump from wall to wall, that would have been an awesome inclusion. There's virtually nobody playing Prey online anymore, but if you want to try it out you can PM me and we could have a 1 on 1. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320011610im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> I have been wanting to play it online again for quite a while.<br /><br />One other thing, you should really try this map you won't regret it:<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320011610/http://www.map-factory.org/prey/all/single-player/lost-city" class="postlink">Lost City by BJA</a></div>]]></body></post><post id="p189159" date="Posted: Wed Sep 26, 2007 4:59 pm "><author>pbmax</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">nice review.<br /><br />i'm gald i'm not the only one that thinks the doom3 engine is still cabale of looking better than what's coming out today.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p189168" date="Posted: Wed Sep 26, 2007 6:16 pm "><author>Hostyle</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">For me it felt like a high quality Quake 4 mod which is high quality Doom 3 mod, nothing more.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p189169" date="Posted: Wed Sep 26, 2007 6:26 pm "><author>The Happy Friar</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">name me one game that isn't a "high quality mod" of something else.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p189173" date="Posted: Wed Sep 26, 2007 7:18 pm "><author>Hostyle</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Unreal 2 the Awakening and Splinter Cell.

I'm always disappointed when games take 10 hours or less (for a 50 euros/dollars title) so there was no way I'd get one that only lasts 5, even if you give the proper internet comment discount.<br /><br />But still, I had liked the demo so a couple of days ago when I saw the game for 20 euros I picked it up. First the bad news, yes the game is awfully short. When I reached the end the game's saves clocked it a hair above the 6 hour mark which jives with my own external counter (6 and a half). I finished the game in two sittings, in the hard difficulty setting, looking at every niche, listening to every radio broadcast, playing with all the arcade machines and even wasting time admiring the level design - and I admired at lot.<br /><br />Even at hard difficulty, the game is very easy because the developers thought the whole "fight the spirits" mini-game was a good alternative to dying. Not only does it rob the whole fear of death thing, it also becomes quite annoying in the second half of the game. Something that didn't become apparent when I played the demo last year.<br /><br />On the positive side, I really enjoyed the fire-fights especially when they were combined with the gravity/portal puzzles with very good use of the 3rd dimension which was surprising since the game also shipped for the xbox 360. The spirit powers were refreshing though they do start to repeat a bit in the last few levels. Even the story was interesting. The radio show and all the small bits of Earth that you encounter really ground you (ha!) into the fantasy of being on an alien ship. It was also downright creepy at times,  with the part with the school bus freaking me out a bit.<br /><br />The art design was masterful. I saw comments that the levels get repetitive with all the game metal textures everywhere but this isn't true in the slightest. The organic sets, the moving machinery, the open areas really do provide variety (as an aside I don't know why more people don't complain that 90% of FarCry is spent in the same god damned jungle). The level design is, the best I've seen on DOOM 3 engine (or similar) technology. The use of lights, curves, particle effects is brilliant. Audio design is top notch too and bonus points for the use of recognizable sound tracks.<br /><br />There aren't too many different alien races, but those that exist have enough variety to keep things interesting and the A.I. is reasonable. The weapons are satisfying and the player physics are solid (based on an id Software engine, these are not surprising). The puzzles are interesting but I wanted more, especially physics ones.<br /><br />The multiplayer was an afterthough, wait... it looks like an afterthought but it's even worse.
