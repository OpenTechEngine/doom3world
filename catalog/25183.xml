What do you need?<br />Obviously some things may get requested more often. In order to determine what exactly this might be - be vocal! <br />The more vocal you are, the better the results will be. Help those who can model, texture and script by sketching out your needs.<br /><br />2.) How do you want it?<br />Well, not that - I mean how should the assets be structured in relation to their later use?<br />I give you an example: You want a crate, fine. Do you also want a simplified texture on it with a distinct color and a number for each side like a dice so you can easily create and modify your own texture on it? Should that cubicle crate have slightly rounded edges?<br />Or a skeleton? Do you need a specific position or an articulated figure that can dropped anyplace?<br /><br />3.) How to structure everything?<br />This is for the creators and users alike.<br />Nobody want his/hers work to get overwritten all the time when you add new assets to your base. Or do you want something like a batch of big files in which all assets of the individual categories got compiled into? Like all models into one fat file so people would only need to download the latest version one time and then play whatever random map that is using the content pack without having to re-download the used assets with each map?<br />I'd like to very strongly suggest a coherent naming structure to keep files from interfering with each other.<br /><br />Here's an example:<br />d3w/textures/panel/whitewolf/coolwallpanel1<br />or:<br />d3w/models/skeleton/whitewolf/glowskeleton1<br /><br />I know most contributors would want to go with a structure like:<br />d3w/whitewolf/textures/panel/coolwallpanel1<br /><br />but honestly - would you want to search primarily by user or by theme?<br /><br />Here's a solution - provide two text files, one that's asset centric and one that's user centric. I this case people can browse by category and if they'll fall in love with the work of one person, they can browse the portfolio of this contributor.<br />This is what I would do - look for the piece I need and if I find something sweet, I'll usually end up looking through the full portfolio of that person.<br />This allows users to do both, cherrypick their assets and retain "brand" recognition of the contributor.<br /><br />I'd love to create an automated upload system which adds the individual file to the base folder on our server, accompanied by a screenshot - this way I, better we, can create an online catalog for people to browse more easily for what they need, including a compiled version for download to look through offline. Compile should take place every week since I fear the files will be rather big. Basically that's what I had in mind when I did register the 6dworld.com domain, it's about time to set things in motion...<br /><br />I believe if we can pull that off by taking your suggestions into account on top what I already have (there's a big plan in my desk, old but surprisingly not dusty since no one did what I had planned years back), then we should a significant increase of high quality work in the near future.<br /><br />One more thing - I take "credits" and copyrights quite seriously. I want that credits will be given where they're due and I don't want to see community work to go unrecognized and exploited in a commercial game with leaving the artist behind. Therefore I'll create an automated system ensure no one goes unrecognized and everything is protected. I got more plans in my head, but first things first :<br /><br />Your input now, ladies and gentlemen!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p236179" date="Posted: Fri Dec 09, 2011 2:43 pm "><author>whitewolf</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">BNA! wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">1.)

I thought about this on many different occasions for almost 10 years now and I am more than convinced any other attempt will fail. I've set up databases with millions of entries in my business and had to keep them failsafe, clean &amp; searchable, I have proof what works, may the gods be with me so I can extrapolate that experience over a hobby board too. I should add, that the distribution folder naming should be reverse: textures/whitewolf/wallpanels/[files...] - I hope that clears up any misunderstanding, I didn't include that thought in my original post, sorry.<br /><br />I however very strongly encourage double naming - d3w/textures/wallpanel/username/file AND!!! d3w/textures/username/walpanel/file .

Yes, I wrote more diva than artist - this wasn't a mistake. <br />I will introduce a system people can be very happy with, but I won't be able to please everyone.<br /><br />In terms of "upload hundreds of textures and check them" - if someone is savy enough to mod, then he's more than equally capable to run a simple search and replace over one or more material files.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">whitewolf wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Licensing: <br />This really has to be kept to a minimum or there is going to be a splintering of assets under a gazillion licenses like sauerbraten.

Either you want other artists to work with your art, or you don't. When a new game comes out which blatantly incorporates stolen work, then the original artist needs to enforce his copyrights. A $$ option is always possible. I was looking into that for a long time and think, I have found a solution that may be beneficial for all parties involved.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">The Happy Friar wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">The biggest thing to watch out for: if it's being used for ANYTHING outside Doom 3 (anything that doesn't requires Doom 3 itself, including a "Free" Doom 3 ala Open Arena or FreeDoom) the user can't use any of the D3 stock stuff as a base.

And I don't think anyone could really ensure the integrity of the potentially uploaded files by checking for Doom3 stock assets. We however can make sure to not drag us into the liability for potential Doom3 base redistribution by a simple check field and full cooperation in cases the original license holder sees need to enforce his copyrights against a specific contributor. <br /><br />In terms of practicability I really don't think id software would go after an artist who creates this all new awesome machine gun but re-uses the stock weapons script by simply altering the name. Legally they could, but it does not appear to be very practical for economically worthwhile for them.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p236192" date="Posted: Fri Dec 09, 2011 5:33 pm "><author>BloodRayne</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I have created many 'objects' that include models, script and def file. e.t.c. 'func_moving_plat' which you can place, target any pathcorner and it will float through all pathcorners, or a func_moving_trap that you can place for elaborate moving traps. I've done all this work for Grimm but am thinking about releasing those objects, both for reference and usage in other projects. I think I have about 10 custom entities like that which eliminate the use of elaborate scripts. You can use these for other purposes too, and you can 'link' these objects together to make elaborate moving machinery, no scripting required. <br /><br />Would these be interesting for this project?<br />My plan was to release them, inlcuding tutorials on how to use them, right after the release of Grim which will be in about two weeks from now, otherwise I'll wait and add it to this project.<br />Ofcourse the models and textures are all fantasy/medieval stuff but the base assets can use any model you'd choose.<br /><br />note: Most of these inherit from D3 base assets, etc. func_mover or func_door</div>]]></body></post><post id="p236193" date="Posted: Fri Dec 09, 2011 5:45 pm "><author>whitewolf</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">BNA! wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">My experience has taught me - build it and they will come.</div><br /><br />Yeah, but you have to remember we have 2 or more potential complete games sitting here. Years of work. I think it only wise to incorporate their input because its their content that they are offering. (I know this is a bit presumptuous on my part but I think if this happened it would be great for everyone including said mod teams) I don't think anyone here wants to see someone rip off Hexen and upload it as their own game, but honestly, and this is with experience in mind, you need some sort of a base to get things going.<br /><br />Let me use my mod as an example. I built this mod from the ground up precisely with the eventual GPL release of the engine in mind. I have a large base of textures and models, both world and moveable, such that it works as a total conversion already in the sense that you can walk through the maps without ever seeing stock assets. I have some weapons and could easily model more provided I get the damn md5 exporter to play nicely with blender. <br /><br />I will never, however, be able to replicate the variety of monsters doom 3 has. This is a huge ask.

You really need this.

It's nice to be able to go back if something breaks, is accidentally deleted, or if someone wants to be an ass and go deleting things.  Makes it simple to just revert anything.  It's also easy to manage who has access/permissions to which directory and also is an easy way to track whose making what additions/changes to any aspect of the repo.<br /><br />On the other hand it will cost more on the server in terms of file space depending on if you have limits or not since everything is always saved.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p236245" date="Posted: Sun Dec 11, 2011 5:56 am "><author>S@TaNiC</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">BNA wrote<div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">3.)

What do you need?<br />Obviously some things may get requested more often. In order to determine what exactly this might be - be vocal! <br />The more vocal you are, the better the results will be. Help those who can model, texture and script by sketching out your needs.<br /><br />2.) How do you want it?<br />Well, not that - I mean how should the assets be structured in relation to their later use?<br />I give you an example: You want a crate, fine. Do you also want a simplified texture on it with a distinct color and a number for each side like a dice so you can easily create and modify your own texture on it? Should that cubicle crate have slightly rounded edges?<br />Or a skeleton? Do you need a specific position or an articulated figure that can dropped anyplace?<br /><br />3.) How to structure everything?<br />This is for the creators and users alike.<br />Nobody want his/hers work to get overwritten all the time when you add new assets to your base. Or do you want something like a batch of big files in which all assets of the individual categories got compiled into? Like all models into one fat file so people would only need to download the latest version one time and then play whatever random map that is using the content pack without having to re-download the used assets with each map?<br />I'd like to very strongly suggest a coherent naming structure to keep files from interfering with each other.<br /><br />Here's an example:<br />d3w/textures/panel/whitewolf/coolwallpanel1<br />or:<br />d3w/models/skeleton/whitewolf/glowskeleton1<br /><br />I know most contributors would want to go with a structure like:<br />d3w/whitewolf/textures/panel/coolwallpanel1<br /><br />but honestly - would you want to search primarily by user or by theme?<br /><br />Here's a solution - provide two text files, one that's asset centric and one that's user centric. I this case people can browse by category and if they'll fall in love with the work of one person, they can browse the portfolio of this contributor.<br />This is what I would do - look for the piece I need and if I find something sweet, I'll usually end up looking through the full portfolio of that person.<br />This allows users to do both, cherrypick their assets and retain "brand" recognition of the contributor.<br /><br />I'd love to create an automated upload system which adds the individual file to the base folder on our server, accompanied by a screenshot - this way I, better we, can create an online catalog for people to browse more easily for what they need, including a compiled version for download to look through offline. Compile should take place every week since I fear the files will be rather big. Basically that's what I had in mind when I did register the 6dworld.com domain, it's about time to set things in motion...<br /><br />I believe if we can pull that off by taking your suggestions into account on top what I already have (there's a big plan in my desk, old but surprisingly not dusty since no one did what I had planned years back), then we should a significant increase of high quality work in the near future.<br /><br />One more thing - I take "credits" and copyrights quite seriously. I want that credits will be given where they're due and I don't want to see community work to go unrecognized and exploited in a commercial game with leaving the artist behind. Therefore I'll create an automated system ensure no one goes unrecognized and everything is protected. I got more plans in my head, but first things first :<br /><br />Your input now, ladies and gentlemen!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p236179" date="Posted: Fri Dec 09, 2011 2:43 pm "><author>whitewolf</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">BNA! wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">1.)

Years of work. I think it only wise to incorporate their input because its their content that they are offering. (I know this is a bit presumptuous on my part but I think if this happened it would be great for everyone including said mod teams) I don't think anyone here wants to see someone rip off Hexen and upload it as their own game, but honestly, and this is with experience in mind, you need some sort of a base to get things going.<br /><br />Let me use my mod as an example. I built this mod from the ground up precisely with the eventual GPL release of the engine in mind. I have a large base of textures and models, both world and moveable, such that it works as a total conversion already in the sense that you can walk through the maps without ever seeing stock assets. I have some weapons and could easily model more provided I get the damn md5 exporter to play nicely with blender. <br /><br />I will never, however, be able to replicate the variety of monsters doom 3 has. This is a huge ask. This is where I need to use other people's assets. <span style="font-weight: bold">If only to get the standalone "game" out the door.</span> The other big thing: <span style="font-weight: bold">not everyone can program.</span> For this reason it would be good to start with a fully working complete game like Hexen or The Ruiner and swap out all my assets for theirs except what I need. <br /><br />What I'm basically saying is that I think its good to retain some sort of base "game" that runs and people can just drop their assets into.

What do you need?<br />Obviously some things may get requested more often. In order to determine what exactly this might be - be vocal! <br />The more vocal you are, the better the results will be. Help those who can model, texture and script by sketching out your needs.<br /><br />2.) How do you want it?<br />Well, not that - I mean how should the assets be structured in relation to their later use?<br />I give you an example: You want a crate, fine. Do you also want a simplified texture on it with a distinct color and a number for each side like a dice so you can easily create and modify your own texture on it? Should that cubicle crate have slightly rounded edges?<br />Or a skeleton? Do you need a specific position or an articulated figure that can dropped anyplace?<br /><br />3.) How to structure everything?<br />This is for the creators and users alike.<br />Nobody want his/hers work to get overwritten all the time when you add new assets to your base. Or do you want something like a batch of big files in which all assets of the individual categories got compiled into? Like all models into one fat file so people would only need to download the latest version one time and then play whatever random map that is using the content pack without having to re-download the used assets with each map?<br />I'd like to very strongly suggest a coherent naming structure to keep files from interfering with each other.<br /><br />Here's an example:<br />d3w/textures/panel/whitewolf/coolwallpanel1<br />or:<br />d3w/models/skeleton/whitewolf/glowskeleton1<br /><br />I know most contributors would want to go with a structure like:<br />d3w/whitewolf/textures/panel/coolwallpanel1<br /><br />but honestly - would you want to search primarily by user or by theme?<br /><br />Here's a solution - provide two text files, one that's asset centric and one that's user centric. I this case people can browse by category and if they'll fall in love with the work of one person, they can browse the portfolio of this contributor.<br />This is what I would do - look for the piece I need and if I find something sweet, I'll usually end up looking through the full portfolio of that person.<br />This allows users to do both, cherrypick their assets and retain "brand" recognition of the contributor.<br /><br />I'd love to create an automated upload system which adds the individual file to the base folder on our server, accompanied by a screenshot - this way I, better we, can create an online catalog for people to browse more easily for what they need, including a compiled version for download to look through offline. Compile should take place every week since I fear the files will be rather big. Basically that's what I had in mind when I did register the 6dworld.com domain, it's about time to set things in motion...<br /><br />I believe if we can pull that off by taking your suggestions into account on top what I already have (there's a big plan in my desk, old but surprisingly not dusty since no one did what I had planned years back), then we should a significant increase of high quality work in the near future.<br /><br />One more thing - I take "credits" and copyrights quite seriously. I want that credits will be given where they're due and I don't want to see community work to go unrecognized and exploited in a commercial game with leaving the artist behind. Therefore I'll create an automated system ensure no one goes unrecognized and everything is protected. I got more plans in my head, but first things first :<br /><br />Your input now, ladies and gentlemen!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p236179" date="Posted: Fri Dec 09, 2011 2:43 pm "><author>whitewolf</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">BNA! wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">1.)

This method has the following benefits: you don't have the clusterfuck of renaming everything to fit a common standard. I'm all for standardisation but this is just impractical. You have textures/whitewolf/ and textures/BNA!/ and then everyone gets his own material file. Remember people use different naming conventions, ie I might use coolpanel_d for diffuse and you might use just coolpanel.tga or you might use coolpanel_bump instead of coolpanel_local. <br /><br />When people are uploading a hundred textures, it starts getting to be a pain in the ass to sift through everything, update the material file, and test it. The mod owners have done this work already so why reinvent the wheel. The other thing is, people may upload under different licenses and yes copyright is important (remember the GPL uses copyright to work!). <br /><br />Licensing: <br />This really has to be kept to a minimum or there is going to be a splintering of assets under a gazillion licenses like sauerbraten.

This method has the following benefits: you don't have the clusterfuck of renaming everything to fit a common standard. I'm all for standardisation but this is just impractical. You have textures/whitewolf/ and textures/BNA!/ and then everyone gets his own material file.

I should add, that the distribution folder naming should be reverse: textures/whitewolf/wallpanels/[files...] - I hope that clears up any misunderstanding, I didn't include that thought in my original post, sorry.<br /><br />I however very strongly encourage double naming - d3w/textures/wallpanel/username/file AND!!! d3w/textures/username/walpanel/file .

What do you need?<br />Obviously some things may get requested more often. In order to determine what exactly this might be - be vocal! <br />The more vocal you are, the better the results will be. Help those who can model, texture and script by sketching out your needs.<br /><br />2.) How do you want it?<br />Well, not that - I mean how should the assets be structured in relation to their later use?<br />I give you an example: You want a crate, fine. Do you also want a simplified texture on it with a distinct color and a number for each side like a dice so you can easily create and modify your own texture on it? Should that cubicle crate have slightly rounded edges?<br />Or a skeleton? Do you need a specific position or an articulated figure that can dropped anyplace?<br /><br />3.) How to structure everything?<br />This is for the creators and users alike.<br />Nobody want his/hers work to get overwritten all the time when you add new assets to your base. Or do you want something like a batch of big files in which all assets of the individual categories got compiled into? Like all models into one fat file so people would only need to download the latest version one time and then play whatever random map that is using the content pack without having to re-download the used assets with each map?<br />I'd like to very strongly suggest a coherent naming structure to keep files from interfering with each other.<br /><br />Here's an example:<br />d3w/textures/panel/whitewolf/coolwallpanel1<br />or:<br />d3w/models/skeleton/whitewolf/glowskeleton1<br /><br />I know most contributors would want to go with a structure like:<br />d3w/whitewolf/textures/panel/coolwallpanel1<br /><br />but honestly - would you want to search primarily by user or by theme?<br /><br />Here's a solution - provide two text files, one that's asset centric and one that's user centric. I this case people can browse by category and if they'll fall in love with the work of one person, they can browse the portfolio of this contributor.<br />This is what I would do - look for the piece I need and if I find something sweet, I'll usually end up looking through the full portfolio of that person.<br />This allows users to do both, cherrypick their assets and retain "brand" recognition of the contributor.<br /><br />I'd love to create an automated upload system which adds the individual file to the base folder on our server, accompanied by a screenshot - this way I, better we, can create an online catalog for people to browse more easily for what they need, including a compiled version for download to look through offline. Compile should take place every week since I fear the files will be rather big. Basically that's what I had in mind when I did register the 6dworld.com domain, it's about time to set things in motion...<br /><br />I believe if we can pull that off by taking your suggestions into account on top what I already have (there's a big plan in my desk, old but surprisingly not dusty since no one did what I had planned years back), then we should a significant increase of high quality work in the near future.<br /><br />One more thing - I take "credits" and copyrights quite seriously. I want that credits will be given where they're due and I don't want to see community work to go unrecognized and exploited in a commercial game with leaving the artist behind. Therefore I'll create an automated system ensure no one goes unrecognized and everything is protected. I got more plans in my head, but first things first :<br /><br />Your input now, ladies and gentlemen!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p236179" date="Posted: Fri Dec 09, 2011 2:43 pm "><author>whitewolf</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">BNA! wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">1.)

Either you want other artists to work with your art, or you don't. When a new game comes out which blatantly incorporates stolen work, then the original artist needs to enforce his copyrights. A $$ option is always possible.

And I don't think anyone could really ensure the integrity of the potentially uploaded files by checking for Doom3 stock assets.

Years of work. I think it only wise to incorporate their input because its their content that they are offering. (I know this is a bit presumptuous on my part but I think if this happened it would be great for everyone including said mod teams) I don't think anyone here wants to see someone rip off Hexen and upload it as their own game, but honestly, and this is with experience in mind, you need some sort of a base to get things going.<br /><br />Let me use my mod as an example. I built this mod from the ground up precisely with the eventual GPL release of the engine in mind. I have a large base of textures and models, both world and moveable, such that it works as a total conversion already in the sense that you can walk through the maps without ever seeing stock assets. I have some weapons and could easily model more provided I get the damn md5 exporter to play nicely with blender. <br /><br />I will never, however, be able to replicate the variety of monsters doom 3 has. This is a huge ask. This is where I need to use other people's assets. <span style="font-weight: bold">If only to get the standalone "game" out the door.</span> The other big thing: <span style="font-weight: bold">not everyone can program.</span> For this reason it would be good to start with a fully working complete game like Hexen or The Ruiner and swap out all my assets for theirs except what I need. <br /><br />What I'm basically saying is that I think its good to retain some sort of base "game" that runs and people can just drop their assets into. You really need this. Think of it as replacing the original Doom 3 as a testbed. <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">BNA! wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"> should add, that the distribution folder naming should be reverse: textures/whitewolf/wallpanels/[files...] - I hope that clears up any misunderstanding, I didn't include that thought in my original post, sorry.<br /><br />I however very strongly encourage double naming - d3w/textures/wallpanel/username/file AND!!! d3w/textures/username/walpanel/file .

The duplicate would read to a human: I want to see everything from userX: textures/userX/wall... /floor...<br />To the computer it will still be: textures/userX/wall - no change.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p236201" date="Posted: Fri Dec 09, 2011 7:34 pm "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">BloodRayne wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Would these be interesting for this project?</div><br /><br />Absolutely!<br /><br />You can release whatever you want whenever you see it fits.<br />Developing a good, reliable platform for a repository will take time.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p236203" date="Posted: Fri Dec 09, 2011 7:40 pm "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">whitewolf wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">What I'm basically saying is that I think its good to retain some sort of base "game" that runs and people can just drop their assets into.

It's nice to be able to go back if something breaks, is accidentally deleted, or if someone wants to be an ass and go deleting things.  Makes it simple to just revert anything.  It's also easy to manage who has access/permissions to which directory and also is an easy way to track whose making what additions/changes to any aspect of the repo.<br /><br />On the other hand it will cost more on the server in terms of file space depending on if you have limits or not since everything is always saved.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p236245" date="Posted: Sun Dec 11, 2011 5:56 am "><author>S@TaNiC</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">BNA wrote<div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">3.)

What do you need?<br />Obviously some things may get requested more often. In order to determine what exactly this might be - be vocal! <br />The more vocal you are, the better the results will be. Help those who can model, texture and script by sketching out your needs.<br /><br />2.) How do you want it?<br />Well, not that - I mean how should the assets be structured in relation to their later use?<br />I give you an example: You want a crate, fine. Do you also want a simplified texture on it with a distinct color and a number for each side like a dice so you can easily create and modify your own texture on it? Should that cubicle crate have slightly rounded edges?<br />Or a skeleton? Do you need a specific position or an articulated figure that can dropped anyplace?<br /><br />3.) How to structure everything?<br />This is for the creators and users alike.<br />Nobody want his/hers work to get overwritten all the time when you add new assets to your base. Or do you want something like a batch of big files in which all assets of the individual categories got compiled into? Like all models into one fat file so people would only need to download the latest version one time and then play whatever random map that is using the content pack without having to re-download the used assets with each map?<br />I'd like to very strongly suggest a coherent naming structure to keep files from interfering with each other.<br /><br />Here's an example:<br />d3w/textures/panel/whitewolf/coolwallpanel1<br />or:<br />d3w/models/skeleton/whitewolf/glowskeleton1<br /><br />I know most contributors would want to go with a structure like:<br />d3w/whitewolf/textures/panel/coolwallpanel1<br /><br />but honestly - would you want to search primarily by user or by theme?<br /><br />Here's a solution - provide two text files, one that's asset centric and one that's user centric. I this case people can browse by category and if they'll fall in love with the work of one person, they can browse the portfolio of this contributor.<br />This is what I would do - look for the piece I need and if I find something sweet, I'll usually end up looking through the full portfolio of that person.<br />This allows users to do both, cherrypick their assets and retain "brand" recognition of the contributor.<br /><br />I'd love to create an automated upload system which adds the individual file to the base folder on our server, accompanied by a screenshot - this way I, better we, can create an online catalog for people to browse more easily for what they need, including a compiled version for download to look through offline. Compile should take place every week since I fear the files will be rather big. Basically that's what I had in mind when I did register the 6dworld.com domain, it's about time to set things in motion...<br /><br />I believe if we can pull that off by taking your suggestions into account on top what I already have (there's a big plan in my desk, old but surprisingly not dusty since no one did what I had planned years back), then we should a significant increase of high quality work in the near future.<br /><br />One more thing - I take "credits" and copyrights quite seriously. I want that credits will be given where they're due and I don't want to see community work to go unrecognized and exploited in a commercial game with leaving the artist behind. Therefore I'll create an automated system ensure no one goes unrecognized and everything is protected. I got more plans in my head, but first things first :<br /><br />Your input now, ladies and gentlemen!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p236179" date="Posted: Fri Dec 09, 2011 2:43 pm "><author>whitewolf</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">BNA! wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">1.)

I was looking into that for a long time and think, I have found a solution that may be beneficial for all parties involved.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">The Happy Friar wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">The biggest thing to watch out for: if it's being used for ANYTHING outside Doom 3 (anything that doesn't requires Doom 3 itself, including a "Free" Doom 3 ala Open Arena or FreeDoom) the user can't use any of the D3 stock stuff as a base.  IE using the weapon rigs for a new weapon, a definition, script, etc.  It wouldn't be a bad idea that you have a checkbox to say if it uses any stock D3 assets when uploading (I'm picturing an upload system simular to the Planet upload system or something like the Blender Model Repository)</div><br /><br />I hear you! And I don't think anyone could really ensure the integrity of the potentially uploaded files by checking for Doom3 stock assets. We however can make sure to not drag us into the liability for potential Doom3 base redistribution by a simple check field and full cooperation in cases the original license holder sees need to enforce his copyrights against a specific contributor. <br /><br />In terms of practicability I really don't think id software would go after an artist who creates this all new awesome machine gun but re-uses the stock weapons script by simply altering the name. Legally they could, but it does not appear to be very practical for economically worthwhile for them.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p236192" date="Posted: Fri Dec 09, 2011 5:33 pm "><author>BloodRayne</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I have created many 'objects' that include models, script and def file. e.t.c. 'func_moving_plat' which you can place, target any pathcorner and it will float through all pathcorners, or a func_moving_trap that you can place for elaborate moving traps. I've done all this work for Grimm but am thinking about releasing those objects, both for reference and usage in other projects. I think I have about 10 custom entities like that which eliminate the use of elaborate scripts. You can use these for other purposes too, and you can 'link' these objects together to make elaborate moving machinery, no scripting required. <br /><br />Would these be interesting for this project?<br />My plan was to release them, inlcuding tutorials on how to use them, right after the release of Grim which will be in about two weeks from now, otherwise I'll wait and add it to this project.<br />Ofcourse the models and textures are all fantasy/medieval stuff but the base assets can use any model you'd choose.<br /><br />note: Most of these inherit from D3 base assets, etc. func_mover or func_door</div>]]></body></post><post id="p236193" date="Posted: Fri Dec 09, 2011 5:45 pm "><author>whitewolf</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">BNA! wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">My experience has taught me - build it and they will come.</div><br /><br />Yeah, but you have to remember we have 2 or more potential complete games sitting here. Years of work. I think it only wise to incorporate their input because its their content that they are offering. (I know this is a bit presumptuous on my part but I think if this happened it would be great for everyone including said mod teams) I don't think anyone here wants to see someone rip off Hexen and upload it as their own game, but honestly, and this is with experience in mind, you need some sort of a base to get things going.<br /><br />Let me use my mod as an example. I built this mod from the ground up precisely with the eventual GPL release of the engine in mind. I have a large base of textures and models, both world and moveable, such that it works as a total conversion already in the sense that you can walk through the maps without ever seeing stock assets. I have some weapons and could easily model more provided I get the damn md5 exporter to play nicely with blender. <br /><br />I will never, however, be able to replicate the variety of monsters doom 3 has. This is a huge ask. This is where I need to use other people's assets. <span style="font-weight: bold">If only to get the standalone "game" out the door.</span> The other big thing: <span style="font-weight: bold">not everyone can program.</span> For this reason it would be good to start with a fully working complete game like Hexen or The Ruiner and swap out all my assets for theirs except what I need. <br /><br />What I'm basically saying is that I think its good to retain some sort of base "game" that runs and people can just drop their assets into.

What do you need?<br />Obviously some things may get requested more often. In order to determine what exactly this might be - be vocal! <br />The more vocal you are, the better the results will be. Help those who can model, texture and script by sketching out your needs.<br /><br />2.) How do you want it?<br />Well, not that - I mean how should the assets be structured in relation to their later use?<br />I give you an example: You want a crate, fine. Do you also want a simplified texture on it with a distinct color and a number for each side like a dice so you can easily create and modify your own texture on it? Should that cubicle crate have slightly rounded edges?<br />Or a skeleton? Do you need a specific position or an articulated figure that can dropped anyplace?<br /><br />3.) How to structure everything?<br />This is for the creators and users alike.<br />Nobody want his/hers work to get overwritten all the time when you add new assets to your base. Or do you want something like a batch of big files in which all assets of the individual categories got compiled into? Like all models into one fat file so people would only need to download the latest version one time and then play whatever random map that is using the content pack without having to re-download the used assets with each map?<br />I'd like to very strongly suggest a coherent naming structure to keep files from interfering with each other.<br /><br />Here's an example:<br />d3w/textures/panel/whitewolf/coolwallpanel1<br />or:<br />d3w/models/skeleton/whitewolf/glowskeleton1<br /><br />I know most contributors would want to go with a structure like:<br />d3w/whitewolf/textures/panel/coolwallpanel1<br /><br />but honestly - would you want to search primarily by user or by theme?<br /><br />Here's a solution - provide two text files, one that's asset centric and one that's user centric. I this case people can browse by category and if they'll fall in love with the work of one person, they can browse the portfolio of this contributor.<br />This is what I would do - look for the piece I need and if I find something sweet, I'll usually end up looking through the full portfolio of that person.<br />This allows users to do both, cherrypick their assets and retain "brand" recognition of the contributor.<br /><br />I'd love to create an automated upload system which adds the individual file to the base folder on our server, accompanied by a screenshot - this way I, better we, can create an online catalog for people to browse more easily for what they need, including a compiled version for download to look through offline. Compile should take place every week since I fear the files will be rather big. Basically that's what I had in mind when I did register the 6dworld.com domain, it's about time to set things in motion...<br /><br />I believe if we can pull that off by taking your suggestions into account on top what I already have (there's a big plan in my desk, old but surprisingly not dusty since no one did what I had planned years back), then we should a significant increase of high quality work in the near future.<br /><br />One more thing - I take "credits" and copyrights quite seriously. I want that credits will be given where they're due and I don't want to see community work to go unrecognized and exploited in a commercial game with leaving the artist behind. Therefore I'll create an automated system ensure no one goes unrecognized and everything is protected. I got more plans in my head, but first things first :<br /><br />Your input now, ladies and gentlemen!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p236179" date="Posted: Fri Dec 09, 2011 2:43 pm "><author>whitewolf</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">BNA! wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">1.)

What do you need?<br />Obviously some things may get requested more often. In order to determine what exactly this might be - be vocal! <br />The more vocal you are, the better the results will be. Help those who can model, texture and script by sketching out your needs.<br /><br />2.) How do you want it?<br />Well, not that - I mean how should the assets be structured in relation to their later use?<br />I give you an example: You want a crate, fine. Do you also want a simplified texture on it with a distinct color and a number for each side like a dice so you can easily create and modify your own texture on it? Should that cubicle crate have slightly rounded edges?<br />Or a skeleton? Do you need a specific position or an articulated figure that can dropped anyplace?<br /><br />3.) How to structure everything?<br />This is for the creators and users alike.<br />Nobody want his/hers work to get overwritten all the time when you add new assets to your base. Or do you want something like a batch of big files in which all assets of the individual categories got compiled into? Like all models into one fat file so people would only need to download the latest version one time and then play whatever random map that is using the content pack without having to re-download the used assets with each map?<br />I'd like to very strongly suggest a coherent naming structure to keep files from interfering with each other.<br /><br />Here's an example:<br />d3w/textures/panel/whitewolf/coolwallpanel1<br />or:<br />d3w/models/skeleton/whitewolf/glowskeleton1<br /><br />I know most contributors would want to go with a structure like:<br />d3w/whitewolf/textures/panel/coolwallpanel1<br /><br />but honestly - would you want to search primarily by user or by theme?<br /><br />Here's a solution - provide two text files, one that's asset centric and one that's user centric. I this case people can browse by category and if they'll fall in love with the work of one person, they can browse the portfolio of this contributor.<br />This is what I would do - look for the piece I need and if I find something sweet, I'll usually end up looking through the full portfolio of that person.<br />This allows users to do both, cherrypick their assets and retain "brand" recognition of the contributor.<br /><br />I'd love to create an automated upload system which adds the individual file to the base folder on our server, accompanied by a screenshot - this way I, better we, can create an online catalog for people to browse more easily for what they need, including a compiled version for download to look through offline. Compile should take place every week since I fear the files will be rather big. Basically that's what I had in mind when I did register the 6dworld.com domain, it's about time to set things in motion...<br /><br />I believe if we can pull that off by taking your suggestions into account on top what I already have (there's a big plan in my desk, old but surprisingly not dusty since no one did what I had planned years back), then we should a significant increase of high quality work in the near future.<br /><br />One more thing - I take "credits" and copyrights quite seriously. I want that credits will be given where they're due and I don't want to see community work to go unrecognized and exploited in a commercial game with leaving the artist behind. Therefore I'll create an automated system ensure no one goes unrecognized and everything is protected. I got more plans in my head, but first things first :<br /><br />Your input now, ladies and gentlemen!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p236179" date="Posted: Fri Dec 09, 2011 2:43 pm "><author>whitewolf</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">BNA! wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">1.)

Years of work. I think it only wise to incorporate their input because its their content that they are offering. (I know this is a bit presumptuous on my part but I think if this happened it would be great for everyone including said mod teams) I don't think anyone here wants to see someone rip off Hexen and upload it as their own game, but honestly, and this is with experience in mind, you need some sort of a base to get things going.<br /><br />Let me use my mod as an example. I built this mod from the ground up precisely with the eventual GPL release of the engine in mind. I have a large base of textures and models, both world and moveable, such that it works as a total conversion already in the sense that you can walk through the maps without ever seeing stock assets. I have some weapons and could easily model more provided I get the damn md5 exporter to play nicely with blender. <br /><br />I will never, however, be able to replicate the variety of monsters doom 3 has. This is a huge ask. This is where I need to use other people's assets. <span style="font-weight: bold">If only to get the standalone "game" out the door.</span> The other big thing: <span style="font-weight: bold">not everyone can program.</span> For this reason it would be good to start with a fully working complete game like Hexen or The Ruiner and swap out all my assets for theirs except what I need. <br /><br />What I'm basically saying is that I think its good to retain some sort of base "game" that runs and people can just drop their assets into. You really need this.

He assumes that the modders/players are smart enough to know what to do (and there's threads on how to use the stuff on the forums too).  I'd say we can assume we're smart enough to know how to use the assets.

It still annoys the death out of me when I think about it.<br /><br />If we build a repository, then people who submit will want others to find their work and use it, otherwise there wouldn't be any point in submitting anything in the first place.

He assumes that the modders/players are smart enough to know what to do (and there's threads on how to use the stuff on the forums too).

Browse: textures/wall/whateverusernameidontcare/files<br />Here's computers: Store file without interference: textures/whateverusernameidontcare/wall/files<br /><br />Since some artist cater especially to the taste of some people, I'd recommend a duplicate material file which adds the identical texture with the same file storage method. The duplicate would read to a human: I want to see everything from userX: textures/userX/wall... /floor...<br />To the computer it will still be: textures/userX/wall - no change.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p236201" date="Posted: Fri Dec 09, 2011 7:34 pm "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">BloodRayne wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Would these be interesting for this project?</div><br /><br />Absolutely!<br /><br />You can release whatever you want whenever you see it fits.<br />Developing a good, reliable platform for a repository will take time.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p236203" date="Posted: Fri Dec 09, 2011 7:40 pm "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">whitewolf wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">What I'm basically saying is that I think its good to retain some sort of base "game" that runs and people can just drop their assets into.

What do you need?<br />Obviously some things may get requested more often. In order to determine what exactly this might be - be vocal! <br />The more vocal you are, the better the results will be. Help those who can model, texture and script by sketching out your needs.<br /><br />2.) How do you want it?<br />Well, not that - I mean how should the assets be structured in relation to their later use?<br />I give you an example: You want a crate, fine. Do you also want a simplified texture on it with a distinct color and a number for each side like a dice so you can easily create and modify your own texture on it? Should that cubicle crate have slightly rounded edges?<br />Or a skeleton? Do you need a specific position or an articulated figure that can dropped anyplace?<br /><br />3.) How to structure everything?<br />This is for the creators and users alike.<br />Nobody want his/hers work to get overwritten all the time when you add new assets to your base. Or do you want something like a batch of big files in which all assets of the individual categories got compiled into? Like all models into one fat file so people would only need to download the latest version one time and then play whatever random map that is using the content pack without having to re-download the used assets with each map?<br />I'd like to very strongly suggest a coherent naming structure to keep files from interfering with each other.<br /><br />Here's an example:<br />d3w/textures/panel/whitewolf/coolwallpanel1<br />or:<br />d3w/models/skeleton/whitewolf/glowskeleton1<br /><br />I know most contributors would want to go with a structure like:<br />d3w/whitewolf/textures/panel/coolwallpanel1<br /><br />but honestly - would you want to search primarily by user or by theme?<br /><br />Here's a solution - provide two text files, one that's asset centric and one that's user centric. I this case people can browse by category and if they'll fall in love with the work of one person, they can browse the portfolio of this contributor.<br />This is what I would do - look for the piece I need and if I find something sweet, I'll usually end up looking through the full portfolio of that person.<br />This allows users to do both, cherrypick their assets and retain "brand" recognition of the contributor.<br /><br />I'd love to create an automated upload system which adds the individual file to the base folder on our server, accompanied by a screenshot - this way I, better we, can create an online catalog for people to browse more easily for what they need, including a compiled version for download to look through offline. Compile should take place every week since I fear the files will be rather big. Basically that's what I had in mind when I did register the 6dworld.com domain, it's about time to set things in motion...<br /><br />I believe if we can pull that off by taking your suggestions into account on top what I already have (there's a big plan in my desk, old but surprisingly not dusty since no one did what I had planned years back), then we should a significant increase of high quality work in the near future.<br /><br />One more thing - I take "credits" and copyrights quite seriously. I want that credits will be given where they're due and I don't want to see community work to go unrecognized and exploited in a commercial game with leaving the artist behind. Therefore I'll create an automated system ensure no one goes unrecognized and everything is protected. I got more plans in my head, but first things first :<br /><br />Your input now, ladies and gentlemen!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p236179" date="Posted: Fri Dec 09, 2011 2:43 pm "><author>whitewolf</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">BNA! wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">1.)

IE using the weapon rigs for a new weapon, a definition, script, etc.  It wouldn't be a bad idea that you have a checkbox to say if it uses any stock D3 assets when uploading (I'm picturing an upload system simular to the Planet upload system or something like the Blender Model Repository)</div><br /><br />I hear you!

(I know this is a bit presumptuous on my part but I think if this happened it would be great for everyone including said mod teams) I don't think anyone here wants to see someone rip off Hexen and upload it as their own game, but honestly, and this is with experience in mind, you need some sort of a base to get things going.<br /><br />Let me use my mod as an example. I built this mod from the ground up precisely with the eventual GPL release of the engine in mind. I have a large base of textures and models, both world and moveable, such that it works as a total conversion already in the sense that you can walk through the maps without ever seeing stock assets. I have some weapons and could easily model more provided I get the damn md5 exporter to play nicely with blender. <br /><br />I will never, however, be able to replicate the variety of monsters doom 3 has.

What do you need?<br />Obviously some things may get requested more often. In order to determine what exactly this might be - be vocal! <br />The more vocal you are, the better the results will be. Help those who can model, texture and script by sketching out your needs.<br /><br />2.) How do you want it?<br />Well, not that - I mean how should the assets be structured in relation to their later use?<br />I give you an example: You want a crate, fine. Do you also want a simplified texture on it with a distinct color and a number for each side like a dice so you can easily create and modify your own texture on it? Should that cubicle crate have slightly rounded edges?<br />Or a skeleton? Do you need a specific position or an articulated figure that can dropped anyplace?<br /><br />3.) How to structure everything?<br />This is for the creators and users alike.<br />Nobody want his/hers work to get overwritten all the time when you add new assets to your base. Or do you want something like a batch of big files in which all assets of the individual categories got compiled into? Like all models into one fat file so people would only need to download the latest version one time and then play whatever random map that is using the content pack without having to re-download the used assets with each map?<br />I'd like to very strongly suggest a coherent naming structure to keep files from interfering with each other.<br /><br />Here's an example:<br />d3w/textures/panel/whitewolf/coolwallpanel1<br />or:<br />d3w/models/skeleton/whitewolf/glowskeleton1<br /><br />I know most contributors would want to go with a structure like:<br />d3w/whitewolf/textures/panel/coolwallpanel1<br /><br />but honestly - would you want to search primarily by user or by theme?<br /><br />Here's a solution - provide two text files, one that's asset centric and one that's user centric. I this case people can browse by category and if they'll fall in love with the work of one person, they can browse the portfolio of this contributor.<br />This is what I would do - look for the piece I need and if I find something sweet, I'll usually end up looking through the full portfolio of that person.<br />This allows users to do both, cherrypick their assets and retain "brand" recognition of the contributor.<br /><br />I'd love to create an automated upload system which adds the individual file to the base folder on our server, accompanied by a screenshot - this way I, better we, can create an online catalog for people to browse more easily for what they need, including a compiled version for download to look through offline. Compile should take place every week since I fear the files will be rather big. Basically that's what I had in mind when I did register the 6dworld.com domain, it's about time to set things in motion...<br /><br />I believe if we can pull that off by taking your suggestions into account on top what I already have (there's a big plan in my desk, old but surprisingly not dusty since no one did what I had planned years back), then we should a significant increase of high quality work in the near future.<br /><br />One more thing - I take "credits" and copyrights quite seriously. I want that credits will be given where they're due and I don't want to see community work to go unrecognized and exploited in a commercial game with leaving the artist behind. Therefore I'll create an automated system ensure no one goes unrecognized and everything is protected. I got more plans in my head, but first things first :<br /><br />Your input now, ladies and gentlemen!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p236179" date="Posted: Fri Dec 09, 2011 2:43 pm "><author>whitewolf</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">BNA! wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">1.)

Either you want other artists to work with your art, or you don't. When a new game comes out which blatantly incorporates stolen work, then the original artist needs to enforce his copyrights. A $$ option is always possible.

Years of work. I think it only wise to incorporate their input because its their content that they are offering. (I know this is a bit presumptuous on my part but I think if this happened it would be great for everyone including said mod teams) I don't think anyone here wants to see someone rip off Hexen and upload it as their own game, but honestly, and this is with experience in mind, you need some sort of a base to get things going.<br /><br />Let me use my mod as an example. I built this mod from the ground up precisely with the eventual GPL release of the engine in mind. I have a large base of textures and models, both world and moveable, such that it works as a total conversion already in the sense that you can walk through the maps without ever seeing stock assets. I have some weapons and could easily model more provided I get the damn md5 exporter to play nicely with blender. <br /><br />I will never, however, be able to replicate the variety of monsters doom 3 has. This is a huge ask. This is where I need to use other people's assets. <span style="font-weight: bold">If only to get the standalone "game" out the door.</span> The other big thing: <span style="font-weight: bold">not everyone can program.</span> For this reason it would be good to start with a fully working complete game like Hexen or The Ruiner and swap out all my assets for theirs except what I need. <br /><br />What I'm basically saying is that I think its good to retain some sort of base "game" that runs and people can just drop their assets into. You really need this. Think of it as replacing the original Doom 3 as a testbed. <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">BNA! wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"> should add, that the distribution folder naming should be reverse: textures/whitewolf/wallpanels/[files...] - I hope that clears up any misunderstanding, I didn't include that thought in my original post, sorry.<br /><br />I however very strongly encourage double naming - d3w/textures/wallpanel/username/file AND!!! d3w/textures/username/walpanel/file .

The duplicate would read to a human: I want to see everything from userX: textures/userX/wall... /floor...<br />To the computer it will still be: textures/userX/wall - no change.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p236201" date="Posted: Fri Dec 09, 2011 7:34 pm "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">BloodRayne wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Would these be interesting for this project?</div><br /><br />Absolutely!<br /><br />You can release whatever you want whenever you see it fits.<br />Developing a good, reliable platform for a repository will take time.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p236203" date="Posted: Fri Dec 09, 2011 7:40 pm "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">whitewolf wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">What I'm basically saying is that I think its good to retain some sort of base "game" that runs and people can just drop their assets into.

It's nice to be able to go back if something breaks, is accidentally deleted, or if someone wants to be an ass and go deleting things.  Makes it simple to just revert anything.  It's also easy to manage who has access/permissions to which directory and also is an easy way to track whose making what additions/changes to any aspect of the repo.<br /><br />On the other hand it will cost more on the server in terms of file space depending on if you have limits or not since everything is always saved.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p236245" date="Posted: Sun Dec 11, 2011 5:56 am "><author>S@TaNiC</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">BNA wrote<div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">3.)

What do you need?<br />Obviously some things may get requested more often. In order to determine what exactly this might be - be vocal! <br />The more vocal you are, the better the results will be. Help those who can model, texture and script by sketching out your needs.<br /><br />2.) How do you want it?<br />Well, not that - I mean how should the assets be structured in relation to their later use?<br />I give you an example: You want a crate, fine. Do you also want a simplified texture on it with a distinct color and a number for each side like a dice so you can easily create and modify your own texture on it? Should that cubicle crate have slightly rounded edges?<br />Or a skeleton? Do you need a specific position or an articulated figure that can dropped anyplace?<br /><br />3.) How to structure everything?<br />This is for the creators and users alike.<br />Nobody want his/hers work to get overwritten all the time when you add new assets to your base. Or do you want something like a batch of big files in which all assets of the individual categories got compiled into? Like all models into one fat file so people would only need to download the latest version one time and then play whatever random map that is using the content pack without having to re-download the used assets with each map?<br />I'd like to very strongly suggest a coherent naming structure to keep files from interfering with each other.<br /><br />Here's an example:<br />d3w/textures/panel/whitewolf/coolwallpanel1<br />or:<br />d3w/models/skeleton/whitewolf/glowskeleton1<br /><br />I know most contributors would want to go with a structure like:<br />d3w/whitewolf/textures/panel/coolwallpanel1<br /><br />but honestly - would you want to search primarily by user or by theme?<br /><br />Here's a solution - provide two text files, one that's asset centric and one that's user centric. I this case people can browse by category and if they'll fall in love with the work of one person, they can browse the portfolio of this contributor.<br />This is what I would do - look for the piece I need and if I find something sweet, I'll usually end up looking through the full portfolio of that person.<br />This allows users to do both, cherrypick their assets and retain "brand" recognition of the contributor.<br /><br />I'd love to create an automated upload system which adds the individual file to the base folder on our server, accompanied by a screenshot - this way I, better we, can create an online catalog for people to browse more easily for what they need, including a compiled version for download to look through offline. Compile should take place every week since I fear the files will be rather big. Basically that's what I had in mind when I did register the 6dworld.com domain, it's about time to set things in motion...<br /><br />I believe if we can pull that off by taking your suggestions into account on top what I already have (there's a big plan in my desk, old but surprisingly not dusty since no one did what I had planned years back), then we should a significant increase of high quality work in the near future.<br /><br />One more thing - I take "credits" and copyrights quite seriously. I want that credits will be given where they're due and I don't want to see community work to go unrecognized and exploited in a commercial game with leaving the artist behind. Therefore I'll create an automated system ensure no one goes unrecognized and everything is protected. I got more plans in my head, but first things first :<br /><br />Your input now, ladies and gentlemen!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p236179" date="Posted: Fri Dec 09, 2011 2:43 pm "><author>whitewolf</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">BNA! wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">1.)

IE using the weapon rigs for a new weapon, a definition, script, etc.  It wouldn't be a bad idea that you have a checkbox to say if it uses any stock D3 assets when uploading (I'm picturing an upload system simular to the Planet upload system or something like the Blender Model Repository)</div><br /><br />I hear you! And I don't think anyone could really ensure the integrity of the potentially uploaded files by checking for Doom3 stock assets. We however can make sure to not drag us into the liability for potential Doom3 base redistribution by a simple check field and full cooperation in cases the original license holder sees need to enforce his copyrights against a specific contributor. <br /><br />In terms of practicability I really don't think id software would go after an artist who creates this all new awesome machine gun but re-uses the stock weapons script by simply altering the name. Legally they could, but it does not appear to be very practical for economically worthwhile for them.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p236192" date="Posted: Fri Dec 09, 2011 5:33 pm "><author>BloodRayne</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I have created many 'objects' that include models, script and def file. e.t.c.

I've done all this work for Grimm but am thinking about releasing those objects, both for reference and usage in other projects. I think I have about 10 custom entities like that which eliminate the use of elaborate scripts. You can use these for other purposes too, and you can 'link' these objects together to make elaborate moving machinery, no scripting required. <br /><br />Would these be interesting for this project?<br />My plan was to release them, inlcuding tutorials on how to use them, right after the release of Grim which will be in about two weeks from now, otherwise I'll wait and add it to this project.<br />Ofcourse the models and textures are all fantasy/medieval stuff but the base assets can use any model you'd choose.<br /><br />note: Most of these inherit from D3 base assets, etc. func_mover or func_door</div>]]></body></post><post id="p236193" date="Posted: Fri Dec 09, 2011 5:45 pm "><author>whitewolf</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">BNA! wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">My experience has taught me - build it and they will come.</div><br /><br />Yeah, but you have to remember we have 2 or more potential complete games sitting here. Years of work. I think it only wise to incorporate their input because its their content that they are offering. (I know this is a bit presumptuous on my part but I think if this happened it would be great for everyone including said mod teams) I don't think anyone here wants to see someone rip off Hexen and upload it as their own game, but honestly, and this is with experience in mind, you need some sort of a base to get things going.<br /><br />Let me use my mod as an example. I built this mod from the ground up precisely with the eventual GPL release of the engine in mind. I have a large base of textures and models, both world and moveable, such that it works as a total conversion already in the sense that you can walk through the maps without ever seeing stock assets. I have some weapons and could easily model more provided I get the damn md5 exporter to play nicely with blender. <br /><br />I will never, however, be able to replicate the variety of monsters doom 3 has.

It's nice to be able to go back if something breaks, is accidentally deleted, or if someone wants to be an ass and go deleting things.  Makes it simple to just revert anything.

What do you need?<br />Obviously some things may get requested more often. In order to determine what exactly this might be - be vocal! <br />The more vocal you are, the better the results will be. Help those who can model, texture and script by sketching out your needs.<br /><br />2.) How do you want it?<br />Well, not that - I mean how should the assets be structured in relation to their later use?<br />I give you an example: You want a crate, fine. Do you also want a simplified texture on it with a distinct color and a number for each side like a dice so you can easily create and modify your own texture on it? Should that cubicle crate have slightly rounded edges?<br />Or a skeleton? Do you need a specific position or an articulated figure that can dropped anyplace?<br /><br />3.) How to structure everything?<br />This is for the creators and users alike.<br />Nobody want his/hers work to get overwritten all the time when you add new assets to your base. Or do you want something like a batch of big files in which all assets of the individual categories got compiled into? Like all models into one fat file so people would only need to download the latest version one time and then play whatever random map that is using the content pack without having to re-download the used assets with each map?<br />I'd like to very strongly suggest a coherent naming structure to keep files from interfering with each other.<br /><br />Here's an example:<br />d3w/textures/panel/whitewolf/coolwallpanel1<br />or:<br />d3w/models/skeleton/whitewolf/glowskeleton1<br /><br />I know most contributors would want to go with a structure like:<br />d3w/whitewolf/textures/panel/coolwallpanel1<br /><br />but honestly - would you want to search primarily by user or by theme?<br /><br />Here's a solution - provide two text files, one that's asset centric and one that's user centric. I this case people can browse by category and if they'll fall in love with the work of one person, they can browse the portfolio of this contributor.<br />This is what I would do - look for the piece I need and if I find something sweet, I'll usually end up looking through the full portfolio of that person.<br />This allows users to do both, cherrypick their assets and retain "brand" recognition of the contributor.<br /><br />I'd love to create an automated upload system which adds the individual file to the base folder on our server, accompanied by a screenshot - this way I, better we, can create an online catalog for people to browse more easily for what they need, including a compiled version for download to look through offline. Compile should take place every week since I fear the files will be rather big. Basically that's what I had in mind when I did register the 6dworld.com domain, it's about time to set things in motion...<br /><br />I believe if we can pull that off by taking your suggestions into account on top what I already have (there's a big plan in my desk, old but surprisingly not dusty since no one did what I had planned years back), then we should a significant increase of high quality work in the near future.<br /><br />One more thing - I take "credits" and copyrights quite seriously. I want that credits will be given where they're due and I don't want to see community work to go unrecognized and exploited in a commercial game with leaving the artist behind. Therefore I'll create an automated system ensure no one goes unrecognized and everything is protected. I got more plans in my head, but first things first :<br /><br />Your input now, ladies and gentlemen!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p236179" date="Posted: Fri Dec 09, 2011 2:43 pm "><author>whitewolf</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">BNA! wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">1.)

Years of work. I think it only wise to incorporate their input because its their content that they are offering. (I know this is a bit presumptuous on my part but I think if this happened it would be great for everyone including said mod teams) I don't think anyone here wants to see someone rip off Hexen and upload it as their own game, but honestly, and this is with experience in mind, you need some sort of a base to get things going.<br /><br />Let me use my mod as an example. I built this mod from the ground up precisely with the eventual GPL release of the engine in mind. I have a large base of textures and models, both world and moveable, such that it works as a total conversion already in the sense that you can walk through the maps without ever seeing stock assets. I have some weapons and could easily model more provided I get the damn md5 exporter to play nicely with blender. <br /><br />I will never, however, be able to replicate the variety of monsters doom 3 has. This is a huge ask.

What do you need?<br />Obviously some things may get requested more often. In order to determine what exactly this might be - be vocal! <br />The more vocal you are, the better the results will be. Help those who can model, texture and script by sketching out your needs.<br /><br />2.) How do you want it?<br />Well, not that - I mean how should the assets be structured in relation to their later use?<br />I give you an example: You want a crate, fine. Do you also want a simplified texture on it with a distinct color and a number for each side like a dice so you can easily create and modify your own texture on it? Should that cubicle crate have slightly rounded edges?<br />Or a skeleton? Do you need a specific position or an articulated figure that can dropped anyplace?<br /><br />3.) How to structure everything?<br />This is for the creators and users alike.<br />Nobody want his/hers work to get overwritten all the time when you add new assets to your base. Or do you want something like a batch of big files in which all assets of the individual categories got compiled into? Like all models into one fat file so people would only need to download the latest version one time and then play whatever random map that is using the content pack without having to re-download the used assets with each map?<br />I'd like to very strongly suggest a coherent naming structure to keep files from interfering with each other.<br /><br />Here's an example:<br />d3w/textures/panel/whitewolf/coolwallpanel1<br />or:<br />d3w/models/skeleton/whitewolf/glowskeleton1<br /><br />I know most contributors would want to go with a structure like:<br />d3w/whitewolf/textures/panel/coolwallpanel1<br /><br />but honestly - would you want to search primarily by user or by theme?<br /><br />Here's a solution - provide two text files, one that's asset centric and one that's user centric. I this case people can browse by category and if they'll fall in love with the work of one person, they can browse the portfolio of this contributor.<br />This is what I would do - look for the piece I need and if I find something sweet, I'll usually end up looking through the full portfolio of that person.<br />This allows users to do both, cherrypick their assets and retain "brand" recognition of the contributor.<br /><br />I'd love to create an automated upload system which adds the individual file to the base folder on our server, accompanied by a screenshot - this way I, better we, can create an online catalog for people to browse more easily for what they need, including a compiled version for download to look through offline. Compile should take place every week since I fear the files will be rather big. Basically that's what I had in mind when I did register the 6dworld.com domain, it's about time to set things in motion...<br /><br />I believe if we can pull that off by taking your suggestions into account on top what I already have (there's a big plan in my desk, old but surprisingly not dusty since no one did what I had planned years back), then we should a significant increase of high quality work in the near future.<br /><br />One more thing - I take "credits" and copyrights quite seriously. I want that credits will be given where they're due and I don't want to see community work to go unrecognized and exploited in a commercial game with leaving the artist behind. Therefore I'll create an automated system ensure no one goes unrecognized and everything is protected. I got more plans in my head, but first things first :<br /><br />Your input now, ladies and gentlemen!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p236179" date="Posted: Fri Dec 09, 2011 2:43 pm "><author>whitewolf</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">BNA! wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">1.)

How to structure everything?</div><br /><br />I strongly favour d3:/textures/whitewolf/wallpanel simply because the alternative could easily become really messy. This method has the following benefits: you don't have the clusterfuck of renaming everything to fit a common standard. I'm all for standardisation but this is just impractical. You have textures/whitewolf/ and textures/BNA!/ and then everyone gets his own material file. Remember people use different naming conventions, ie I might use coolpanel_d for diffuse and you might use just coolpanel.tga or you might use coolpanel_bump instead of coolpanel_local. <br /><br />When people are uploading a hundred textures, it starts getting to be a pain in the ass to sift through everything, update the material file, and test it. The mod owners have done this work already so why reinvent the wheel. The other thing is, people may upload under different licenses and yes copyright is important (remember the GPL uses copyright to work!). <br /><br />Licensing: <br />This really has to be kept to a minimum or there is going to be a splintering of assets under a gazillion licenses like sauerbraten. I would suggest at this point either CC Share-alike-attribution (which is basically the GPL for art assets) or the do-whatever-the-fuck-you-want license.

This method has the following benefits: you don't have the clusterfuck of renaming everything to fit a common standard. I'm all for standardisation but this is just impractical. You have textures/whitewolf/ and textures/BNA!/ and then everyone gets his own material file.

I've set up databases with millions of entries in my business and had to keep them failsafe, clean &amp; searchable, I have proof what works, may the gods be with me so I can extrapolate that experience over a hobby board too. I should add, that the distribution folder naming should be reverse: textures/whitewolf/wallpanels/[files...] - I hope that clears up any misunderstanding, I didn't include that thought in my original post, sorry.<br /><br />I however very strongly encourage double naming - d3w/textures/wallpanel/username/file AND!!! d3w/textures/username/walpanel/file .

I built this mod from the ground up precisely with the eventual GPL release of the engine in mind. I have a large base of textures and models, both world and moveable, such that it works as a total conversion already in the sense that you can walk through the maps without ever seeing stock assets.

What do you need?<br />Obviously some things may get requested more often. In order to determine what exactly this might be - be vocal! <br />The more vocal you are, the better the results will be. Help those who can model, texture and script by sketching out your needs.<br /><br />2.) How do you want it?<br />Well, not that - I mean how should the assets be structured in relation to their later use?<br />I give you an example: You want a crate, fine. Do you also want a simplified texture on it with a distinct color and a number for each side like a dice so you can easily create and modify your own texture on it? Should that cubicle crate have slightly rounded edges?<br />Or a skeleton? Do you need a specific position or an articulated figure that can dropped anyplace?<br /><br />3.) How to structure everything?<br />This is for the creators and users alike.<br />Nobody want his/hers work to get overwritten all the time when you add new assets to your base. Or do you want something like a batch of big files in which all assets of the individual categories got compiled into? Like all models into one fat file so people would only need to download the latest version one time and then play whatever random map that is using the content pack without having to re-download the used assets with each map?<br />I'd like to very strongly suggest a coherent naming structure to keep files from interfering with each other.<br /><br />Here's an example:<br />d3w/textures/panel/whitewolf/coolwallpanel1<br />or:<br />d3w/models/skeleton/whitewolf/glowskeleton1<br /><br />I know most contributors would want to go with a structure like:<br />d3w/whitewolf/textures/panel/coolwallpanel1<br /><br />but honestly - would you want to search primarily by user or by theme?<br /><br />Here's a solution - provide two text files, one that's asset centric and one that's user centric. I this case people can browse by category and if they'll fall in love with the work of one person, they can browse the portfolio of this contributor.<br />This is what I would do - look for the piece I need and if I find something sweet, I'll usually end up looking through the full portfolio of that person.<br />This allows users to do both, cherrypick their assets and retain "brand" recognition of the contributor.<br /><br />I'd love to create an automated upload system which adds the individual file to the base folder on our server, accompanied by a screenshot - this way I, better we, can create an online catalog for people to browse more easily for what they need, including a compiled version for download to look through offline. Compile should take place every week since I fear the files will be rather big. Basically that's what I had in mind when I did register the 6dworld.com domain, it's about time to set things in motion...<br /><br />I believe if we can pull that off by taking your suggestions into account on top what I already have (there's a big plan in my desk, old but surprisingly not dusty since no one did what I had planned years back), then we should a significant increase of high quality work in the near future.<br /><br />One more thing - I take "credits" and copyrights quite seriously. I want that credits will be given where they're due and I don't want to see community work to go unrecognized and exploited in a commercial game with leaving the artist behind. Therefore I'll create an automated system ensure no one goes unrecognized and everything is protected. I got more plans in my head, but first things first :<br /><br />Your input now, ladies and gentlemen!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p236179" date="Posted: Fri Dec 09, 2011 2:43 pm "><author>whitewolf</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">BNA! wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">1.)

Either you want other artists to work with your art, or you don't. When a new game comes out which blatantly incorporates stolen work, then the original artist needs to enforce his copyrights. A $$ option is always possible.

Years of work. I think it only wise to incorporate their input because its their content that they are offering. (I know this is a bit presumptuous on my part but I think if this happened it would be great for everyone including said mod teams) I don't think anyone here wants to see someone rip off Hexen and upload it as their own game, but honestly, and this is with experience in mind, you need some sort of a base to get things going.<br /><br />Let me use my mod as an example. I built this mod from the ground up precisely with the eventual GPL release of the engine in mind. I have a large base of textures and models, both world and moveable, such that it works as a total conversion already in the sense that you can walk through the maps without ever seeing stock assets. I have some weapons and could easily model more provided I get the damn md5 exporter to play nicely with blender. <br /><br />I will never, however, be able to replicate the variety of monsters doom 3 has. This is a huge ask. This is where I need to use other people's assets. <span style="font-weight: bold">If only to get the standalone "game" out the door.</span> The other big thing: <span style="font-weight: bold">not everyone can program.</span> For this reason it would be good to start with a fully working complete game like Hexen or The Ruiner and swap out all my assets for theirs except what I need. <br /><br />What I'm basically saying is that I think its good to retain some sort of base "game" that runs and people can just drop their assets into. You really need this. Think of it as replacing the original Doom 3 as a testbed. <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">BNA! wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"> should add, that the distribution folder naming should be reverse: textures/whitewolf/wallpanels/[files...] - I hope that clears up any misunderstanding, I didn't include that thought in my original post, sorry.<br /><br />I however very strongly encourage double naming - d3w/textures/wallpanel/username/file AND!!! d3w/textures/username/walpanel/file .

The duplicate would read to a human: I want to see everything from userX: textures/userX/wall... /floor...<br />To the computer it will still be: textures/userX/wall - no change.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p236201" date="Posted: Fri Dec 09, 2011 7:34 pm "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">BloodRayne wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Would these be interesting for this project?</div><br /><br />Absolutely!<br /><br />You can release whatever you want whenever you see it fits.<br />Developing a good, reliable platform for a repository will take time.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p236203" date="Posted: Fri Dec 09, 2011 7:40 pm "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">whitewolf wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">What I'm basically saying is that I think its good to retain some sort of base "game" that runs and people can just drop their assets into.

It's nice to be able to go back if something breaks, is accidentally deleted, or if someone wants to be an ass and go deleting things.  Makes it simple to just revert anything.  It's also easy to manage who has access/permissions to which directory and also is an easy way to track whose making what additions/changes to any aspect of the repo.<br /><br />On the other hand it will cost more on the server in terms of file space depending on if you have limits or not since everything is always saved.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p236245" date="Posted: Sun Dec 11, 2011 5:56 am "><author>S@TaNiC</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">BNA wrote<div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">3.)

What do you need?<br />Obviously some things may get requested more often. In order to determine what exactly this might be - be vocal! <br />The more vocal you are, the better the results will be. Help those who can model, texture and script by sketching out your needs.<br /><br />2.) How do you want it?<br />Well, not that - I mean how should the assets be structured in relation to their later use?<br />I give you an example: You want a crate, fine. Do you also want a simplified texture on it with a distinct color and a number for each side like a dice so you can easily create and modify your own texture on it? Should that cubicle crate have slightly rounded edges?<br />Or a skeleton? Do you need a specific position or an articulated figure that can dropped anyplace?<br /><br />3.) How to structure everything?<br />This is for the creators and users alike.<br />Nobody want his/hers work to get overwritten all the time when you add new assets to your base. Or do you want something like a batch of big files in which all assets of the individual categories got compiled into? Like all models into one fat file so people would only need to download the latest version one time and then play whatever random map that is using the content pack without having to re-download the used assets with each map?<br />I'd like to very strongly suggest a coherent naming structure to keep files from interfering with each other.<br /><br />Here's an example:<br />d3w/textures/panel/whitewolf/coolwallpanel1<br />or:<br />d3w/models/skeleton/whitewolf/glowskeleton1<br /><br />I know most contributors would want to go with a structure like:<br />d3w/whitewolf/textures/panel/coolwallpanel1<br /><br />but honestly - would you want to search primarily by user or by theme?<br /><br />Here's a solution - provide two text files, one that's asset centric and one that's user centric. I this case people can browse by category and if they'll fall in love with the work of one person, they can browse the portfolio of this contributor.<br />This is what I would do - look for the piece I need and if I find something sweet, I'll usually end up looking through the full portfolio of that person.<br />This allows users to do both, cherrypick their assets and retain "brand" recognition of the contributor.<br /><br />I'd love to create an automated upload system which adds the individual file to the base folder on our server, accompanied by a screenshot - this way I, better we, can create an online catalog for people to browse more easily for what they need, including a compiled version for download to look through offline. Compile should take place every week since I fear the files will be rather big. Basically that's what I had in mind when I did register the 6dworld.com domain, it's about time to set things in motion...<br /><br />I believe if we can pull that off by taking your suggestions into account on top what I already have (there's a big plan in my desk, old but surprisingly not dusty since no one did what I had planned years back), then we should a significant increase of high quality work in the near future.<br /><br />One more thing - I take "credits" and copyrights quite seriously. I want that credits will be given where they're due and I don't want to see community work to go unrecognized and exploited in a commercial game with leaving the artist behind. Therefore I'll create an automated system ensure no one goes unrecognized and everything is protected. I got more plans in my head, but first things first :<br /><br />Your input now, ladies and gentlemen!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p236179" date="Posted: Fri Dec 09, 2011 1:43 pm "><author>whitewolf</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">BNA! wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">1.)

What do you need?<br />Obviously some things may get requested more often. In order to determine what exactly this might be - be vocal! <br />The more vocal you are, the better the results will be. Help those who can model, texture and script by sketching out your needs.<br /><br />2.) How do you want it?<br />Well, not that - I mean how should the assets be structured in relation to their later use?<br />I give you an example: You want a crate, fine. Do you also want a simplified texture on it with a distinct color and a number for each side like a dice so you can easily create and modify your own texture on it? Should that cubicle crate have slightly rounded edges?<br />Or a skeleton? Do you need a specific position or an articulated figure that can dropped anyplace?<br /><br />3.) How to structure everything?<br />This is for the creators and users alike.<br />Nobody want his/hers work to get overwritten all the time when you add new assets to your base. Or do you want something like a batch of big files in which all assets of the individual categories got compiled into? Like all models into one fat file so people would only need to download the latest version one time and then play whatever random map that is using the content pack without having to re-download the used assets with each map?<br />I'd like to very strongly suggest a coherent naming structure to keep files from interfering with each other.<br /><br />Here's an example:<br />d3w/textures/panel/whitewolf/coolwallpanel1<br />or:<br />d3w/models/skeleton/whitewolf/glowskeleton1<br /><br />I know most contributors would want to go with a structure like:<br />d3w/whitewolf/textures/panel/coolwallpanel1<br /><br />but honestly - would you want to search primarily by user or by theme?<br /><br />Here's a solution - provide two text files, one that's asset centric and one that's user centric. I this case people can browse by category and if they'll fall in love with the work of one person, they can browse the portfolio of this contributor.<br />This is what I would do - look for the piece I need and if I find something sweet, I'll usually end up looking through the full portfolio of that person.<br />This allows users to do both, cherrypick their assets and retain "brand" recognition of the contributor.<br /><br />I'd love to create an automated upload system which adds the individual file to the base folder on our server, accompanied by a screenshot - this way I, better we, can create an online catalog for people to browse more easily for what they need, including a compiled version for download to look through offline. Compile should take place every week since I fear the files will be rather big. Basically that's what I had in mind when I did register the 6dworld.com domain, it's about time to set things in motion...<br /><br />I believe if we can pull that off by taking your suggestions into account on top what I already have (there's a big plan in my desk, old but surprisingly not dusty since no one did what I had planned years back), then we should a significant increase of high quality work in the near future.<br /><br />One more thing - I take "credits" and copyrights quite seriously. I want that credits will be given where they're due and I don't want to see community work to go unrecognized and exploited in a commercial game with leaving the artist behind. Therefore I'll create an automated system ensure no one goes unrecognized and everything is protected. I got more plans in my head, but first things first :<br /><br />Your input now, ladies and gentlemen!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p236179" date="Posted: Fri Dec 09, 2011 2:43 pm "><author>whitewolf</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">BNA! wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">1.)

I should add, that the distribution folder naming should be reverse: textures/whitewolf/wallpanels/[files...] - I hope that clears up any misunderstanding, I didn't include that thought in my original post, sorry.<br /><br />I however very strongly encourage double naming - d3w/textures/wallpanel/username/file AND!!! d3w/textures/username/walpanel/file . If someone says "nah, my may or the highway" then very fine - I strongly support strong opinions, even if they lead to self chosen excluding of ones work. Time will tell, if I'll get proven wrong, I'll adjust accordingly or hand it over.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">whitewolf wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">When people are uploading a hundred textures, it starts getting to be a pain in the ass to sift through everything, update the material file, and test it.

I built this mod from the ground up precisely with the eventual GPL release of the engine in mind. I have a large base of textures and models, both world and moveable, such that it works as a total conversion already in the sense that you can walk through the maps without ever seeing stock assets.

What do you need?<br />Obviously some things may get requested more often. In order to determine what exactly this might be - be vocal! <br />The more vocal you are, the better the results will be. Help those who can model, texture and script by sketching out your needs.<br /><br />2.) How do you want it?<br />Well, not that - I mean how should the assets be structured in relation to their later use?<br />I give you an example: You want a crate, fine. Do you also want a simplified texture on it with a distinct color and a number for each side like a dice so you can easily create and modify your own texture on it? Should that cubicle crate have slightly rounded edges?<br />Or a skeleton? Do you need a specific position or an articulated figure that can dropped anyplace?<br /><br />3.) How to structure everything?<br />This is for the creators and users alike.<br />Nobody want his/hers work to get overwritten all the time when you add new assets to your base. Or do you want something like a batch of big files in which all assets of the individual categories got compiled into? Like all models into one fat file so people would only need to download the latest version one time and then play whatever random map that is using the content pack without having to re-download the used assets with each map?<br />I'd like to very strongly suggest a coherent naming structure to keep files from interfering with each other.<br /><br />Here's an example:<br />d3w/textures/panel/whitewolf/coolwallpanel1<br />or:<br />d3w/models/skeleton/whitewolf/glowskeleton1<br /><br />I know most contributors would want to go with a structure like:<br />d3w/whitewolf/textures/panel/coolwallpanel1<br /><br />but honestly - would you want to search primarily by user or by theme?<br /><br />Here's a solution - provide two text files, one that's asset centric and one that's user centric. I this case people can browse by category and if they'll fall in love with the work of one person, they can browse the portfolio of this contributor.<br />This is what I would do - look for the piece I need and if I find something sweet, I'll usually end up looking through the full portfolio of that person.<br />This allows users to do both, cherrypick their assets and retain "brand" recognition of the contributor.<br /><br />I'd love to create an automated upload system which adds the individual file to the base folder on our server, accompanied by a screenshot - this way I, better we, can create an online catalog for people to browse more easily for what they need, including a compiled version for download to look through offline. Compile should take place every week since I fear the files will be rather big. Basically that's what I had in mind when I did register the 6dworld.com domain, it's about time to set things in motion...<br /><br />I believe if we can pull that off by taking your suggestions into account on top what I already have (there's a big plan in my desk, old but surprisingly not dusty since no one did what I had planned years back), then we should a significant increase of high quality work in the near future.<br /><br />One more thing - I take "credits" and copyrights quite seriously. I want that credits will be given where they're due and I don't want to see community work to go unrecognized and exploited in a commercial game with leaving the artist behind. Therefore I'll create an automated system ensure no one goes unrecognized and everything is protected. I got more plans in my head, but first things first :<br /><br />Your input now, ladies and gentlemen!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p236179" date="Posted: Fri Dec 09, 2011 2:43 pm "><author>whitewolf</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">BNA! wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">1.)

Either you want other artists to work with your art, or you don't. When a new game comes out which blatantly incorporates stolen work, then the original artist needs to enforce his copyrights. A $$ option is always possible.

Years of work. I think it only wise to incorporate their input because its their content that they are offering. (I know this is a bit presumptuous on my part but I think if this happened it would be great for everyone including said mod teams) I don't think anyone here wants to see someone rip off Hexen and upload it as their own game, but honestly, and this is with experience in mind, you need some sort of a base to get things going.<br /><br />Let me use my mod as an example. I built this mod from the ground up precisely with the eventual GPL release of the engine in mind. I have a large base of textures and models, both world and moveable, such that it works as a total conversion already in the sense that you can walk through the maps without ever seeing stock assets. I have some weapons and could easily model more provided I get the damn md5 exporter to play nicely with blender. <br /><br />I will never, however, be able to replicate the variety of monsters doom 3 has. This is a huge ask. This is where I need to use other people's assets. <span style="font-weight: bold">If only to get the standalone "game" out the door.</span> The other big thing: <span style="font-weight: bold">not everyone can program.</span> For this reason it would be good to start with a fully working complete game like Hexen or The Ruiner and swap out all my assets for theirs except what I need. <br /><br />What I'm basically saying is that I think its good to retain some sort of base "game" that runs and people can just drop their assets into. You really need this. Think of it as replacing the original Doom 3 as a testbed. <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">BNA! wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"> should add, that the distribution folder naming should be reverse: textures/whitewolf/wallpanels/[files...] - I hope that clears up any misunderstanding, I didn't include that thought in my original post, sorry.<br /><br />I however very strongly encourage double naming - d3w/textures/wallpanel/username/file AND!!! d3w/textures/username/walpanel/file .

The duplicate would read to a human: I want to see everything from userX: textures/userX/wall... /floor...<br />To the computer it will still be: textures/userX/wall - no change.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p236201" date="Posted: Fri Dec 09, 2011 7:34 pm "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">BloodRayne wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Would these be interesting for this project?</div><br /><br />Absolutely!<br /><br />You can release whatever you want whenever you see it fits.<br />Developing a good, reliable platform for a repository will take time.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p236203" date="Posted: Fri Dec 09, 2011 7:40 pm "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">whitewolf wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">What I'm basically saying is that I think its good to retain some sort of base "game" that runs and people can just drop their assets into.

It's nice to be able to go back if something breaks, is accidentally deleted, or if someone wants to be an ass and go deleting things.  Makes it simple to just revert anything.  It's also easy to manage who has access/permissions to which directory and also is an easy way to track whose making what additions/changes to any aspect of the repo.<br /><br />On the other hand it will cost more on the server in terms of file space depending on if you have limits or not since everything is always saved.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p236245" date="Posted: Sun Dec 11, 2011 5:56 am "><author>S@TaNiC</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">BNA wrote<div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">3.)

What do you need?<br />Obviously some things may get requested more often. In order to determine what exactly this might be - be vocal! <br />The more vocal you are, the better the results will be. Help those who can model, texture and script by sketching out your needs.<br /><br />2.) How do you want it?<br />Well, not that - I mean how should the assets be structured in relation to their later use?<br />I give you an example: You want a crate, fine. Do you also want a simplified texture on it with a distinct color and a number for each side like a dice so you can easily create and modify your own texture on it? Should that cubicle crate have slightly rounded edges?<br />Or a skeleton? Do you need a specific position or an articulated figure that can dropped anyplace?<br /><br />3.) How to structure everything?<br />This is for the creators and users alike.<br />Nobody want his/hers work to get overwritten all the time when you add new assets to your base. Or do you want something like a batch of big files in which all assets of the individual categories got compiled into? Like all models into one fat file so people would only need to download the latest version one time and then play whatever random map that is using the content pack without having to re-download the used assets with each map?<br />I'd like to very strongly suggest a coherent naming structure to keep files from interfering with each other.<br /><br />Here's an example:<br />d3w/textures/panel/whitewolf/coolwallpanel1<br />or:<br />d3w/models/skeleton/whitewolf/glowskeleton1<br /><br />I know most contributors would want to go with a structure like:<br />d3w/whitewolf/textures/panel/coolwallpanel1<br /><br />but honestly - would you want to search primarily by user or by theme?<br /><br />Here's a solution - provide two text files, one that's asset centric and one that's user centric. I this case people can browse by category and if they'll fall in love with the work of one person, they can browse the portfolio of this contributor.<br />This is what I would do - look for the piece I need and if I find something sweet, I'll usually end up looking through the full portfolio of that person.<br />This allows users to do both, cherrypick their assets and retain "brand" recognition of the contributor.<br /><br />I'd love to create an automated upload system which adds the individual file to the base folder on our server, accompanied by a screenshot - this way I, better we, can create an online catalog for people to browse more easily for what they need, including a compiled version for download to look through offline. Compile should take place every week since I fear the files will be rather big. Basically that's what I had in mind when I did register the 6dworld.com domain, it's about time to set things in motion...<br /><br />I believe if we can pull that off by taking your suggestions into account on top what I already have (there's a big plan in my desk, old but surprisingly not dusty since no one did what I had planned years back), then we should a significant increase of high quality work in the near future.<br /><br />One more thing - I take "credits" and copyrights quite seriously. I want that credits will be given where they're due and I don't want to see community work to go unrecognized and exploited in a commercial game with leaving the artist behind. Therefore I'll create an automated system ensure no one goes unrecognized and everything is protected. I got more plans in my head, but first things first :<br /><br />Your input now, ladies and gentlemen!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p236179" date="Posted: Fri Dec 09, 2011 2:43 pm "><author>whitewolf</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">BNA! wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">1.)

I was looking into that for a long time and think, I have found a solution that may be beneficial for all parties involved.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">The Happy Friar wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">The biggest thing to watch out for: if it's being used for ANYTHING outside Doom 3 (anything that doesn't requires Doom 3 itself, including a "Free" Doom 3 ala Open Arena or FreeDoom) the user can't use any of the D3 stock stuff as a base.  IE using the weapon rigs for a new weapon, a definition, script, etc.  It wouldn't be a bad idea that you have a checkbox to say if it uses any stock D3 assets when uploading (I'm picturing an upload system simular to the Planet upload system or something like the Blender Model Repository)</div><br /><br />I hear you! And I don't think anyone could really ensure the integrity of the potentially uploaded files by checking for Doom3 stock assets. We however can make sure to not drag us into the liability for potential Doom3 base redistribution by a simple check field and full cooperation in cases the original license holder sees need to enforce his copyrights against a specific contributor. <br /><br />In terms of practicability I really don't think id software would go after an artist who creates this all new awesome machine gun but re-uses the stock weapons script by simply altering the name. Legally they could, but it does not appear to be very practical for economically worthwhile for them.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p236192" date="Posted: Fri Dec 09, 2011 5:33 pm "><author>BloodRayne</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I have created many 'objects' that include models, script and def file. e.t.c. 'func_moving_plat' which you can place, target any pathcorner and it will float through all pathcorners, or a func_moving_trap that you can place for elaborate moving traps. I've done all this work for Grimm but am thinking about releasing those objects, both for reference and usage in other projects. I think I have about 10 custom entities like that which eliminate the use of elaborate scripts. You can use these for other purposes too, and you can 'link' these objects together to make elaborate moving machinery, no scripting required. <br /><br />Would these be interesting for this project?<br />My plan was to release them, inlcuding tutorials on how to use them, right after the release of Grim which will be in about two weeks from now, otherwise I'll wait and add it to this project.<br />Ofcourse the models and textures are all fantasy/medieval stuff but the base assets can use any model you'd choose.<br /><br />note: Most of these inherit from D3 base assets, etc. func_mover or func_door</div>]]></body></post><post id="p236193" date="Posted: Fri Dec 09, 2011 5:45 pm "><author>whitewolf</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">BNA! wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">My experience has taught me - build it and they will come.</div><br /><br />Yeah, but you have to remember we have 2 or more potential complete games sitting here. Years of work. I think it only wise to incorporate their input because its their content that they are offering. (I know this is a bit presumptuous on my part but I think if this happened it would be great for everyone including said mod teams) I don't think anyone here wants to see someone rip off Hexen and upload it as their own game, but honestly, and this is with experience in mind, you need some sort of a base to get things going.<br /><br />Let me use my mod as an example. I built this mod from the ground up precisely with the eventual GPL release of the engine in mind. I have a large base of textures and models, both world and moveable, such that it works as a total conversion already in the sense that you can walk through the maps without ever seeing stock assets. I have some weapons and could easily model more provided I get the damn md5 exporter to play nicely with blender. <br /><br />I will never, however, be able to replicate the variety of monsters doom 3 has. This is a huge ask.

What do you need?<br />Obviously some things may get requested more often. In order to determine what exactly this might be - be vocal! <br />The more vocal you are, the better the results will be. Help those who can model, texture and script by sketching out your needs.<br /><br />2.) How do you want it?<br />Well, not that - I mean how should the assets be structured in relation to their later use?<br />I give you an example: You want a crate, fine. Do you also want a simplified texture on it with a distinct color and a number for each side like a dice so you can easily create and modify your own texture on it? Should that cubicle crate have slightly rounded edges?<br />Or a skeleton? Do you need a specific position or an articulated figure that can dropped anyplace?<br /><br />3.) How to structure everything?<br />This is for the creators and users alike.<br />Nobody want his/hers work to get overwritten all the time when you add new assets to your base. Or do you want something like a batch of big files in which all assets of the individual categories got compiled into? Like all models into one fat file so people would only need to download the latest version one time and then play whatever random map that is using the content pack without having to re-download the used assets with each map?<br />I'd like to very strongly suggest a coherent naming structure to keep files from interfering with each other.<br /><br />Here's an example:<br />d3w/textures/panel/whitewolf/coolwallpanel1<br />or:<br />d3w/models/skeleton/whitewolf/glowskeleton1<br /><br />I know most contributors would want to go with a structure like:<br />d3w/whitewolf/textures/panel/coolwallpanel1<br /><br />but honestly - would you want to search primarily by user or by theme?<br /><br />Here's a solution - provide two text files, one that's asset centric and one that's user centric. I this case people can browse by category and if they'll fall in love with the work of one person, they can browse the portfolio of this contributor.<br />This is what I would do - look for the piece I need and if I find something sweet, I'll usually end up looking through the full portfolio of that person.<br />This allows users to do both, cherrypick their assets and retain "brand" recognition of the contributor.<br /><br />I'd love to create an automated upload system which adds the individual file to the base folder on our server, accompanied by a screenshot - this way I, better we, can create an online catalog for people to browse more easily for what they need, including a compiled version for download to look through offline. Compile should take place every week since I fear the files will be rather big. Basically that's what I had in mind when I did register the 6dworld.com domain, it's about time to set things in motion...<br /><br />I believe if we can pull that off by taking your suggestions into account on top what I already have (there's a big plan in my desk, old but surprisingly not dusty since no one did what I had planned years back), then we should a significant increase of high quality work in the near future.<br /><br />One more thing - I take "credits" and copyrights quite seriously. I want that credits will be given where they're due and I don't want to see community work to go unrecognized and exploited in a commercial game with leaving the artist behind. Therefore I'll create an automated system ensure no one goes unrecognized and everything is protected. I got more plans in my head, but first things first :<br /><br />Your input now, ladies and gentlemen!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p236179" date="Posted: Fri Dec 09, 2011 2:43 pm "><author>whitewolf</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">BNA! wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">1.)

What do you need?<br />Obviously some things may get requested more often. In order to determine what exactly this might be - be vocal! <br />The more vocal you are, the better the results will be. Help those who can model, texture and script by sketching out your needs.<br /><br />2.) How do you want it?<br />Well, not that - I mean how should the assets be structured in relation to their later use?<br />I give you an example: You want a crate, fine. Do you also want a simplified texture on it with a distinct color and a number for each side like a dice so you can easily create and modify your own texture on it? Should that cubicle crate have slightly rounded edges?<br />Or a skeleton? Do you need a specific position or an articulated figure that can dropped anyplace?<br /><br />3.) How to structure everything?<br />This is for the creators and users alike.<br />Nobody want his/hers work to get overwritten all the time when you add new assets to your base. Or do you want something like a batch of big files in which all assets of the individual categories got compiled into? Like all models into one fat file so people would only need to download the latest version one time and then play whatever random map that is using the content pack without having to re-download the used assets with each map?<br />I'd like to very strongly suggest a coherent naming structure to keep files from interfering with each other.<br /><br />Here's an example:<br />d3w/textures/panel/whitewolf/coolwallpanel1<br />or:<br />d3w/models/skeleton/whitewolf/glowskeleton1<br /><br />I know most contributors would want to go with a structure like:<br />d3w/whitewolf/textures/panel/coolwallpanel1<br /><br />but honestly - would you want to search primarily by user or by theme?<br /><br />Here's a solution - provide two text files, one that's asset centric and one that's user centric. I this case people can browse by category and if they'll fall in love with the work of one person, they can browse the portfolio of this contributor.<br />This is what I would do - look for the piece I need and if I find something sweet, I'll usually end up looking through the full portfolio of that person.<br />This allows users to do both, cherrypick their assets and retain "brand" recognition of the contributor.<br /><br />I'd love to create an automated upload system which adds the individual file to the base folder on our server, accompanied by a screenshot - this way I, better we, can create an online catalog for people to browse more easily for what they need, including a compiled version for download to look through offline. Compile should take place every week since I fear the files will be rather big. Basically that's what I had in mind when I did register the 6dworld.com domain, it's about time to set things in motion...<br /><br />I believe if we can pull that off by taking your suggestions into account on top what I already have (there's a big plan in my desk, old but surprisingly not dusty since no one did what I had planned years back), then we should a significant increase of high quality work in the near future.<br /><br />One more thing - I take "credits" and copyrights quite seriously. I want that credits will be given where they're due and I don't want to see community work to go unrecognized and exploited in a commercial game with leaving the artist behind. Therefore I'll create an automated system ensure no one goes unrecognized and everything is protected. I got more plans in my head, but first things first :<br /><br />Your input now, ladies and gentlemen!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p236179" date="Posted: Fri Dec 09, 2011 2:43 pm "><author>whitewolf</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">BNA! wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">1.)

Years of work. I think it only wise to incorporate their input because its their content that they are offering. (I know this is a bit presumptuous on my part but I think if this happened it would be great for everyone including said mod teams) I don't think anyone here wants to see someone rip off Hexen and upload it as their own game, but honestly, and this is with experience in mind, you need some sort of a base to get things going.<br /><br />Let me use my mod as an example. I built this mod from the ground up precisely with the eventual GPL release of the engine in mind. I have a large base of textures and models, both world and moveable, such that it works as a total conversion already in the sense that you can walk through the maps without ever seeing stock assets. I have some weapons and could easily model more provided I get the damn md5 exporter to play nicely with blender. <br /><br />I will never, however, be able to replicate the variety of monsters doom 3 has. This is a huge ask. This is where I need to use other people's assets. <span style="font-weight: bold">If only to get the standalone "game" out the door.</span> The other big thing: <span style="font-weight: bold">not everyone can program.</span> For this reason it would be good to start with a fully working complete game like Hexen or The Ruiner and swap out all my assets for theirs except what I need. <br /><br />What I'm basically saying is that I think its good to retain some sort of base "game" that runs and people can just drop their assets into. You really need this.

He assumes that the modders/players are smart enough to know what to do (and there's threads on how to use the stuff on the forums too).  I'd say we can assume we're smart enough to know how to use the assets.

It still annoys the death out of me when I think about it.<br /><br />If we build a repository, then people who submit will want others to find their work and use it, otherwise there wouldn't be any point in submitting anything in the first place.

He assumes that the modders/players are smart enough to know what to do (and there's threads on how to use the stuff on the forums too).

Browse: textures/wall/whateverusernameidontcare/files<br />Here's computers: Store file without interference: textures/whateverusernameidontcare/wall/files<br /><br />Since some artist cater especially to the taste of some people, I'd recommend a duplicate material file which adds the identical texture with the same file storage method. The duplicate would read to a human: I want to see everything from userX: textures/userX/wall... /floor...<br />To the computer it will still be: textures/userX/wall - no change.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p236201" date="Posted: Fri Dec 09, 2011 7:34 pm "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">BloodRayne wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Would these be interesting for this project?</div><br /><br />Absolutely!<br /><br />You can release whatever you want whenever you see it fits.<br />Developing a good, reliable platform for a repository will take time.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p236203" date="Posted: Fri Dec 09, 2011 7:40 pm "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">whitewolf wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">What I'm basically saying is that I think its good to retain some sort of base "game" that runs and people can just drop their assets into.

What do you need?<br />Obviously some things may get requested more often. In order to determine what exactly this might be - be vocal! <br />The more vocal you are, the better the results will be. Help those who can model, texture and script by sketching out your needs.<br /><br />2.) How do you want it?<br />Well, not that - I mean how should the assets be structured in relation to their later use?<br />I give you an example: You want a crate, fine. Do you also want a simplified texture on it with a distinct color and a number for each side like a dice so you can easily create and modify your own texture on it? Should that cubicle crate have slightly rounded edges?<br />Or a skeleton? Do you need a specific position or an articulated figure that can dropped anyplace?<br /><br />3.) How to structure everything?<br />This is for the creators and users alike.<br />Nobody want his/hers work to get overwritten all the time when you add new assets to your base. Or do you want something like a batch of big files in which all assets of the individual categories got compiled into? Like all models into one fat file so people would only need to download the latest version one time and then play whatever random map that is using the content pack without having to re-download the used assets with each map?<br />I'd like to very strongly suggest a coherent naming structure to keep files from interfering with each other.<br /><br />Here's an example:<br />d3w/textures/panel/whitewolf/coolwallpanel1<br />or:<br />d3w/models/skeleton/whitewolf/glowskeleton1<br /><br />I know most contributors would want to go with a structure like:<br />d3w/whitewolf/textures/panel/coolwallpanel1<br /><br />but honestly - would you want to search primarily by user or by theme?<br /><br />Here's a solution - provide two text files, one that's asset centric and one that's user centric. I this case people can browse by category and if they'll fall in love with the work of one person, they can browse the portfolio of this contributor.<br />This is what I would do - look for the piece I need and if I find something sweet, I'll usually end up looking through the full portfolio of that person.<br />This allows users to do both, cherrypick their assets and retain "brand" recognition of the contributor.<br /><br />I'd love to create an automated upload system which adds the individual file to the base folder on our server, accompanied by a screenshot - this way I, better we, can create an online catalog for people to browse more easily for what they need, including a compiled version for download to look through offline. Compile should take place every week since I fear the files will be rather big. Basically that's what I had in mind when I did register the 6dworld.com domain, it's about time to set things in motion...<br /><br />I believe if we can pull that off by taking your suggestions into account on top what I already have (there's a big plan in my desk, old but surprisingly not dusty since no one did what I had planned years back), then we should a significant increase of high quality work in the near future.<br /><br />One more thing - I take "credits" and copyrights quite seriously. I want that credits will be given where they're due and I don't want to see community work to go unrecognized and exploited in a commercial game with leaving the artist behind. Therefore I'll create an automated system ensure no one goes unrecognized and everything is protected. I got more plans in my head, but first things first :<br /><br />Your input now, ladies and gentlemen!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p236179" date="Posted: Fri Dec 09, 2011 2:43 pm "><author>whitewolf</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">BNA! wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">1.)

IE using the weapon rigs for a new weapon, a definition, script, etc.  It wouldn't be a bad idea that you have a checkbox to say if it uses any stock D3 assets when uploading (I'm picturing an upload system simular to the Planet upload system or something like the Blender Model Repository)</div><br /><br />I hear you!

(I know this is a bit presumptuous on my part but I think if this happened it would be great for everyone including said mod teams) I don't think anyone here wants to see someone rip off Hexen and upload it as their own game, but honestly, and this is with experience in mind, you need some sort of a base to get things going.<br /><br />Let me use my mod as an example. I built this mod from the ground up precisely with the eventual GPL release of the engine in mind. I have a large base of textures and models, both world and moveable, such that it works as a total conversion already in the sense that you can walk through the maps without ever seeing stock assets. I have some weapons and could easily model more provided I get the damn md5 exporter to play nicely with blender. <br /><br />I will never, however, be able to replicate the variety of monsters doom 3 has.

What do you need?<br />Obviously some things may get requested more often. In order to determine what exactly this might be - be vocal! <br />The more vocal you are, the better the results will be. Help those who can model, texture and script by sketching out your needs.<br /><br />2.) How do you want it?<br />Well, not that - I mean how should the assets be structured in relation to their later use?<br />I give you an example: You want a crate, fine. Do you also want a simplified texture on it with a distinct color and a number for each side like a dice so you can easily create and modify your own texture on it? Should that cubicle crate have slightly rounded edges?<br />Or a skeleton? Do you need a specific position or an articulated figure that can dropped anyplace?<br /><br />3.) How to structure everything?<br />This is for the creators and users alike.<br />Nobody want his/hers work to get overwritten all the time when you add new assets to your base. Or do you want something like a batch of big files in which all assets of the individual categories got compiled into? Like all models into one fat file so people would only need to download the latest version one time and then play whatever random map that is using the content pack without having to re-download the used assets with each map?<br />I'd like to very strongly suggest a coherent naming structure to keep files from interfering with each other.<br /><br />Here's an example:<br />d3w/textures/panel/whitewolf/coolwallpanel1<br />or:<br />d3w/models/skeleton/whitewolf/glowskeleton1<br /><br />I know most contributors would want to go with a structure like:<br />d3w/whitewolf/textures/panel/coolwallpanel1<br /><br />but honestly - would you want to search primarily by user or by theme?<br /><br />Here's a solution - provide two text files, one that's asset centric and one that's user centric. I this case people can browse by category and if they'll fall in love with the work of one person, they can browse the portfolio of this contributor.<br />This is what I would do - look for the piece I need and if I find something sweet, I'll usually end up looking through the full portfolio of that person.<br />This allows users to do both, cherrypick their assets and retain "brand" recognition of the contributor.<br /><br />I'd love to create an automated upload system which adds the individual file to the base folder on our server, accompanied by a screenshot - this way I, better we, can create an online catalog for people to browse more easily for what they need, including a compiled version for download to look through offline. Compile should take place every week since I fear the files will be rather big. Basically that's what I had in mind when I did register the 6dworld.com domain, it's about time to set things in motion...<br /><br />I believe if we can pull that off by taking your suggestions into account on top what I already have (there's a big plan in my desk, old but surprisingly not dusty since no one did what I had planned years back), then we should a significant increase of high quality work in the near future.<br /><br />One more thing - I take "credits" and copyrights quite seriously. I want that credits will be given where they're due and I don't want to see community work to go unrecognized and exploited in a commercial game with leaving the artist behind. Therefore I'll create an automated system ensure no one goes unrecognized and everything is protected. I got more plans in my head, but first things first :<br /><br />Your input now, ladies and gentlemen!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p236179" date="Posted: Fri Dec 09, 2011 2:43 pm "><author>whitewolf</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">BNA! wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">1.)

Either you want other artists to work with your art, or you don't. When a new game comes out which blatantly incorporates stolen work, then the original artist needs to enforce his copyrights. A $$ option is always possible.

Years of work. I think it only wise to incorporate their input because its their content that they are offering. (I know this is a bit presumptuous on my part but I think if this happened it would be great for everyone including said mod teams) I don't think anyone here wants to see someone rip off Hexen and upload it as their own game, but honestly, and this is with experience in mind, you need some sort of a base to get things going.<br /><br />Let me use my mod as an example. I built this mod from the ground up precisely with the eventual GPL release of the engine in mind. I have a large base of textures and models, both world and moveable, such that it works as a total conversion already in the sense that you can walk through the maps without ever seeing stock assets. I have some weapons and could easily model more provided I get the damn md5 exporter to play nicely with blender. <br /><br />I will never, however, be able to replicate the variety of monsters doom 3 has. This is a huge ask. This is where I need to use other people's assets. <span style="font-weight: bold">If only to get the standalone "game" out the door.</span> The other big thing: <span style="font-weight: bold">not everyone can program.</span> For this reason it would be good to start with a fully working complete game like Hexen or The Ruiner and swap out all my assets for theirs except what I need. <br /><br />What I'm basically saying is that I think its good to retain some sort of base "game" that runs and people can just drop their assets into. You really need this. Think of it as replacing the original Doom 3 as a testbed. <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">BNA! wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"> should add, that the distribution folder naming should be reverse: textures/whitewolf/wallpanels/[files...] - I hope that clears up any misunderstanding, I didn't include that thought in my original post, sorry.<br /><br />I however very strongly encourage double naming - d3w/textures/wallpanel/username/file AND!!! d3w/textures/username/walpanel/file .

The duplicate would read to a human: I want to see everything from userX: textures/userX/wall... /floor...<br />To the computer it will still be: textures/userX/wall - no change.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p236201" date="Posted: Fri Dec 09, 2011 7:34 pm "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">BloodRayne wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Would these be interesting for this project?</div><br /><br />Absolutely!<br /><br />You can release whatever you want whenever you see it fits.<br />Developing a good, reliable platform for a repository will take time.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p236203" date="Posted: Fri Dec 09, 2011 7:40 pm "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">whitewolf wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">What I'm basically saying is that I think its good to retain some sort of base "game" that runs and people can just drop their assets into.

It's nice to be able to go back if something breaks, is accidentally deleted, or if someone wants to be an ass and go deleting things.  Makes it simple to just revert anything.  It's also easy to manage who has access/permissions to which directory and also is an easy way to track whose making what additions/changes to any aspect of the repo.<br /><br />On the other hand it will cost more on the server in terms of file space depending on if you have limits or not since everything is always saved.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p236245" date="Posted: Sun Dec 11, 2011 5:56 am "><author>S@TaNiC</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">BNA wrote<div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">3.)

What do you need?<br />Obviously some things may get requested more often. In order to determine what exactly this might be - be vocal! <br />The more vocal you are, the better the results will be. Help those who can model, texture and script by sketching out your needs.<br /><br />2.) How do you want it?<br />Well, not that - I mean how should the assets be structured in relation to their later use?<br />I give you an example: You want a crate, fine. Do you also want a simplified texture on it with a distinct color and a number for each side like a dice so you can easily create and modify your own texture on it? Should that cubicle crate have slightly rounded edges?<br />Or a skeleton? Do you need a specific position or an articulated figure that can dropped anyplace?<br /><br />3.) How to structure everything?<br />This is for the creators and users alike.<br />Nobody want his/hers work to get overwritten all the time when you add new assets to your base. Or do you want something like a batch of big files in which all assets of the individual categories got compiled into? Like all models into one fat file so people would only need to download the latest version one time and then play whatever random map that is using the content pack without having to re-download the used assets with each map?<br />I'd like to very strongly suggest a coherent naming structure to keep files from interfering with each other.<br /><br />Here's an example:<br />d3w/textures/panel/whitewolf/coolwallpanel1<br />or:<br />d3w/models/skeleton/whitewolf/glowskeleton1<br /><br />I know most contributors would want to go with a structure like:<br />d3w/whitewolf/textures/panel/coolwallpanel1<br /><br />but honestly - would you want to search primarily by user or by theme?<br /><br />Here's a solution - provide two text files, one that's asset centric and one that's user centric. I this case people can browse by category and if they'll fall in love with the work of one person, they can browse the portfolio of this contributor.<br />This is what I would do - look for the piece I need and if I find something sweet, I'll usually end up looking through the full portfolio of that person.<br />This allows users to do both, cherrypick their assets and retain "brand" recognition of the contributor.<br /><br />I'd love to create an automated upload system which adds the individual file to the base folder on our server, accompanied by a screenshot - this way I, better we, can create an online catalog for people to browse more easily for what they need, including a compiled version for download to look through offline. Compile should take place every week since I fear the files will be rather big. Basically that's what I had in mind when I did register the 6dworld.com domain, it's about time to set things in motion...<br /><br />I believe if we can pull that off by taking your suggestions into account on top what I already have (there's a big plan in my desk, old but surprisingly not dusty since no one did what I had planned years back), then we should a significant increase of high quality work in the near future.<br /><br />One more thing - I take "credits" and copyrights quite seriously. I want that credits will be given where they're due and I don't want to see community work to go unrecognized and exploited in a commercial game with leaving the artist behind. Therefore I'll create an automated system ensure no one goes unrecognized and everything is protected. I got more plans in my head, but first things first :<br /><br />Your input now, ladies and gentlemen!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p236179" date="Posted: Fri Dec 09, 2011 2:43 pm "><author>whitewolf</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">BNA! wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">1.)

I was looking into that for a long time and think, I have found a solution that may be beneficial for all parties involved.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">The Happy Friar wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">The biggest thing to watch out for: if it's being used for ANYTHING outside Doom 3 (anything that doesn't requires Doom 3 itself, including a "Free" Doom 3 ala Open Arena or FreeDoom) the user can't use any of the D3 stock stuff as a base.  IE using the weapon rigs for a new weapon, a definition, script, etc.  It wouldn't be a bad idea that you have a checkbox to say if it uses any stock D3 assets when uploading (I'm picturing an upload system simular to the Planet upload system or something like the Blender Model Repository)</div><br /><br />I hear you! And I don't think anyone could really ensure the integrity of the potentially uploaded files by checking for Doom3 stock assets. We however can make sure to not drag us into the liability for potential Doom3 base redistribution by a simple check field and full cooperation in cases the original license holder sees need to enforce his copyrights against a specific contributor. <br /><br />In terms of practicability I really don't think id software would go after an artist who creates this all new awesome machine gun but re-uses the stock weapons script by simply altering the name. Legally they could, but it does not appear to be very practical for economically worthwhile for them.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p236192" date="Posted: Fri Dec 09, 2011 5:33 pm "><author>BloodRayne</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I have created many 'objects' that include models, script and def file. e.t.c.

I've done all this work for Grimm but am thinking about releasing those objects, both for reference and usage in other projects. I think I have about 10 custom entities like that which eliminate the use of elaborate scripts. You can use these for other purposes too, and you can 'link' these objects together to make elaborate moving machinery, no scripting required. <br /><br />Would these be interesting for this project?<br />My plan was to release them, inlcuding tutorials on how to use them, right after the release of Grim which will be in about two weeks from now, otherwise I'll wait and add it to this project.<br />Ofcourse the models and textures are all fantasy/medieval stuff but the base assets can use any model you'd choose.<br /><br />note: Most of these inherit from D3 base assets, etc. func_mover or func_door</div>]]></body></post><post id="p236193" date="Posted: Fri Dec 09, 2011 5:45 pm "><author>whitewolf</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">BNA! wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">My experience has taught me - build it and they will come.</div><br /><br />Yeah, but you have to remember we have 2 or more potential complete games sitting here. Years of work. I think it only wise to incorporate their input because its their content that they are offering. (I know this is a bit presumptuous on my part but I think if this happened it would be great for everyone including said mod teams) I don't think anyone here wants to see someone rip off Hexen and upload it as their own game, but honestly, and this is with experience in mind, you need some sort of a base to get things going.<br /><br />Let me use my mod as an example. I built this mod from the ground up precisely with the eventual GPL release of the engine in mind. I have a large base of textures and models, both world and moveable, such that it works as a total conversion already in the sense that you can walk through the maps without ever seeing stock assets. I have some weapons and could easily model more provided I get the damn md5 exporter to play nicely with blender. <br /><br />I will never, however, be able to replicate the variety of monsters doom 3 has.

It's nice to be able to go back if something breaks, is accidentally deleted, or if someone wants to be an ass and go deleting things.  Makes it simple to just revert anything.
