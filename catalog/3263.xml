Just cubes that go out when they take damage would be fine. I remember way back in quake 2 you could take a brush and make it emit light; is there a similar way to produce simple light emmiters in doom 3?... or do I need to make a light-looking brush with health and a light object and link them together somehow?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p30944" date="Posted: Mon Aug 09, 2004 1:11 am "><author>subverse</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">The only way its worked reliably for me so far;
<br /><br />Make a brush, turn it into a func_damageable.
<br />Add a health parameter to it.

<br /><br />I like this way, because there's nice shattering sounds and you don't have a leftover brush.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p37429" date="Posted: Wed Aug 18, 2004 1:34 am "><author>JustinBailey</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">The way I've done it turns the light off but you can still see the broken light fixture even in a pitch black room..
<br /><br />Make a patch with your breakable light texture, such as "textures/base_light/striplight2_break".  Create a light entity next to it and open the light editor.  Scroll through the light textures and choose "lights/squarelight_breakable_off".  Select both the light texture (patch mesh) and the light entity and press shift-k to link the entities.  With the entities selected, press N and add the "health" tag and give it a value of "1".
<br /><br />With this, the light will go out when shot and the light texture will change to a broken fixture, but it is still visible in dark rooms....</div>]]></body></post><post id="p37438" date="Posted: Wed Aug 18, 2004 1:43 am "><author>hexbox</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I had the same problem with the broken light brush viewable in the dark room, that's why I started using the glass instead.  The problem with using glass is that you've got to model a fixture around it, which is a pain.
<br /><br />Anyone know why the brush is visible after you turn the light out?
<br /><br />And, out of curiousity, how many breakable lights are you all planning to put into your maps?  I'm becoming obsessed with them..  I may make almost every light breakable.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p40224" date="Posted: Sun Aug 22, 2004 9:39 pm "><author>blue calx</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Something's strange here.
<br /><br />I tried linking the patch with the light texture and the light together with CTRL-K, and it doesn't work.
<br /><br />I noticed on D3DM2 that the light fixtures themselves are part of the light entity -- you select the light emitter and it will also highlight the geometry on the ceiling, and vice versa -- is this what grouping the light brush/patch with the light is supposed to accomplish?  Why isn't CTRL-K doing anything?
<br /><br />I also tried ungrouping both, and then selecting them again and Creating a light -- but that just destroys the brush and the light and makes a single point light.
<br /><br />Making the light brush a func_damageable, with targeting the light, works -- but the texture on the func_damageable does not change accordingly.  And it doesn't come with an automatic electric-crackle sound effect that id's method does.
<br /><br />Exactly how did id make a single light entity consisting of both the brushes (without destroying the brush's geometry) as well as the light-emitter?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p44669" date="Posted: Tue Aug 31, 2004 7:34 am "><author>H3g3m0n</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I notice that the properties for the light entity have model aswell as break ,health, broken, hideModelOnBreak so maby you need to set a model on the light.

<br /><br />SHIFT-K to link entities.

<br /><br />This works.  (note the shift-k not ctrl-k as daz said)  You can also then give your light a sound shader of light_hum_103 or similar, and after being shot out it will flicker on and off in sync with a buzzy sound.  Add to that a func_fx with some sparks, and you've got a full blown breakable light.  A good example (copy+paste powah) is in d3dm5 in the room with the shotgun above the crates.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p47684" date="Posted: Mon Sep 06, 2004 8:39 pm "><author>KillerSneak</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">this might sound dumb , but how can i make a patch :S</div>]]></body></post><post id="p47702" date="Posted: Mon Sep 06, 2004 9:49 pm "><author>KillerSneak</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">never mind guys got it <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100522163312im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> only

<br /><br />create either a func_fracture or func_damageable
<br />assign it a model (the light you want )
<br />other way is take the group of brushes you want and make it a func_fracture or damagaeable if your not using a model)
<br /><br />in the entity tab click sound assign it a sound 
<br /><br />create a light bind it to the func_....
<br />when the damageable or fracture is triggered and disapates so will your light you can also trigger a func_emmiter with them to emit sparks
<br />101 ways of doing it some are easier for some folks some harder depends on preference
<br /><br />also in the very light properties are model and model_broken or broke_model) im at work so going off memory
<br />you can assign all the values you need in the light properties without the need of additional entities
<br />etc.
<br /><br />or you can create a complex beast of a events to do it 
<br />you say tomato I say tom(ah)to etc..</div>]]></body></post><post id="p132623" date="Posted: Wed Feb 08, 2006 9:00 pm "><author>ColdT</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">How I did my breakable lights is...
<br /><br />A light entity + a patch mesh with flare material + a func_static with a material which has this blend add...<div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">   {<br />      if (parm7==0)<br />      blend   add<br />      map   textures/mitm2/light_lit.tga<br />      colored<br />   }</div>
<br />Select them all and combine. Give the new entity a health value and when you shoot any part of it, the light goes out and the blend add and flare are no longer drawn.

<br />Hey, that's great: easy and immediate. But is it possible to shut off multiple lights with a single func_damageable?
<br /><br />EDIT:
<br />Never mind, I figured it out! Just add more parameters named "target2", "target3" and so on, each pointing at one of the lights you want to shut off. That's great, I love shootable lights!</div>]]></body></post></posts></thread></xml>
