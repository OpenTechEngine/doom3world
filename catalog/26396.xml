The game has loaded and plays great, except, all the panels that have numbers such as the lockers to get health/ammo, and the monitor screens where I have to put in a number or activate something are all fuzzy. For instance when you are looking at a panel that is not working it looks fuzzy, but the one you need to work with has something on it to read or numbers to punch. All my screens/ monitors are fuzzy. Even when a monitor should show a video of someone talking it appears fuzzy.
