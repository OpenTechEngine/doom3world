It is not allowed to portray cruelty in a glorifying, distorting or self serving purpose type of way in Germany to prevent a repeating of the past. Most people get that wrong about Germany, which, as far as I am concerned, is fine. The reason for this is that people should not link cruelty and violence (excessive blood, dismemberment...) with fun (like in computer games) to prevent society from acting sensible.
