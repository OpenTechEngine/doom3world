<br /><br />That would be a good idea, this is just what I kinda figured out how it worked, it's just for basics, I suggest you write a more indepth tutorial on how to make one that, well could stop at different levels or so, to be controllable via an GUI.
<br /><br />If I understand it and it wont be too big I might convert it into a Video Tutorial.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p39187" date="Posted: Fri Aug 20, 2004 10:33 pm "><author>RedWolf</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">If you want it to stop at dif, levels, it must be a func_mover, with a script. Func_plat is only used for your basic up or down 1 level. And, are probably better for multiplayer maps as you said then the multilevel elevators. I really haven't needed to too look into it, but I have seen a tut for elevators that can go to dif floors, on another board (actually linked from this one) If i find it ill leave a link here. I could; however, show you how to use a gui to activate it.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p39239" date="Posted: Sat Aug 21, 2004 12:21 am "><author>MNeMiC</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">i dont think that would be too hard to figure out, just not tested it yet, not needed to ^_^ but go ahead and write a platform written tutorial for the 56kers</div>]]></body></post><post id="p39300" date="Posted: Sat Aug 21, 2004 4:05 am "><author>c0bra</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">At one point your mouse goes completely off the screen for a while.

<br /><br />Actually, I was pausing the video to 'not take so much time to correct my mistake', since I wanted to go back to the texture window and show it but didn't wanna take so much time again by draggint it out and clicking it since I dont wanna use so many shortcuts. So I was pausing the movie to fix it.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p39416" date="Posted: Sat Aug 21, 2004 9:53 am "><author>-pro-</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">well, i still cant even get to the website, all links time out :/</div>]]></body></post><post id="p40214" date="Posted: Sun Aug 22, 2004 9:19 pm "><author>ShAdY</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">MNeMiC,
<br />           Just wanted to say thanks for the videos.. I was just wondering if maybe your could slow down and maybe add some audio to explain why you are doing the things you are doing. Yes, yes i know it will make the file size higher but i really believe that it will be worth it. And anyway not like all the people on here dont have high speed anyway. I'm sure folks wont mind taking the extra couple of minutes to download to get a great video. Anyway, just my opinion from a fellow mapper. Thanks.

<br /><br />Speed is another problem however, I don't think I can do so much about it, I'm trying really hard to slow down even now at the tutorials, when I really work I work alot faster than this, if this is 1 in pace, I work like 1.4 normally :S
<br /><br />I can try though =/</div>]]></body></post><post id="p42830" date="Posted: Fri Aug 27, 2004 5:58 pm "><author>MNeMiC</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">UPdaTEd with soUnD =D
