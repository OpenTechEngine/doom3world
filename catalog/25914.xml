Do you have time for another couple q's?<br /><br /><br />1. You said I could grab your installer -- does it make any gameplay changes? What exactly does it do?

Do you have time for another couple q's?<br /><br /><br />1. You said I could grab your installer -- does it make any gameplay changes? What exactly does it do?

This is something I've never been clear on. What should my doomconfig.cfg settings actually be?

This is caused by the HD textures residing in Doom3\base folder instead of in Doom3\sikkmod folder.<br />If you want pure vanilla move base\textures base\models base\materials to the sikkmod folder though the HD textures dont take up a load of FPS it does increase load time <br />by some, but if you can live with that its better to just leave them where they are, it still plays like vanilla just looks better <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319220512im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />.<br /><br />If you use Doom3-hd.exe then sikkmod fires up and you get a HD menu with options to select 16:9 and 16:10 display (uses a modified version of 6th venoms HD menu).<br />You can access sikkmods settings from it also and its encouraged to toy a bit with its settings to get a good result. Warning enabling all the bells and whistles will<br />drop your FPS like a 10 ton brick so toy a bit with the different settings. <br /><br />Most FPS heavy settings are SSAO / SoftShadows.
