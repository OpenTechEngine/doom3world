This contains the first fully playable map. <br /><br />All models, textures, scripting and music are done by me. Most of the sounds are vanilla Doom 3 sounds.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Introduction:</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic">The earth is shattered by wars and famine. Only the strongest have remained in underground sietches. They cannot reach above ground and use handmade remote controlled robots to explore the world to gather resources and increase the chance of survival. You are part of an elite unit sent out to unlock the mysteries of the 'Energy Ribbon'. From within the control center of humanity you control some of the most advanced combat Droids in the world. You search for a mythical energy source that is said to make the world habitable again. If you succeed, humanity might one day go back to the surface and reconquer the world!</span><br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224130533/http://www.hexenmod.com/downloads/sanctity.zip" class="postlink"><span style="font-weight: bold">Download link</span></a> (42 MB, zip file)<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Instructions</span><br />As usual, download zip. Create folder in your Doom3 directory. Name that 'sanctity'. Unzip the pk4 file into this directory. Start up Doom3 and choose the mod from the 'mods' menu.<br />If you find glitches, errors, funny stuff. Let me know in this thread and I'll take it along in the next build.<br /><br />Screenshots:<br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224130533im_/http://www.hexenmod.com/downloads/shot00026.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224130533im_/http://www.hexenmod.com/downloads/shot00051.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224130533im_/http://www.hexenmod.com/downloads/shot00061.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224130533im_/http://www.hexenmod.com/downloads/shot00062.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Even more screenshots:  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224130533im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224130533/http://img243.imageshack.us/i/shot00029a.jpg/" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224130533im_/http://img243.imageshack.us/img243/7799/shot00029a.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224130533/http://img571.imageshack.us/i/shot00055.jpg/" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224130533im_/http://img571.imageshack.us/img571/4329/shot00055.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224130533/http://img687.imageshack.us/i/shot00050o.jpg/" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224130533im_/http://img687.imageshack.us/img687/8421/shot00050o.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224130533/http://img204.imageshack.us/i/shot00046m.jpg/" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224130533im_/http://img204.imageshack.us/img204/6064/shot00046m.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224130533/http://img31.imageshack.us/i/shot00043n.jpg/" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224130533im_/http://img31.imageshack.us/img31/487/shot00043n.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224130533/http://img704.imageshack.us/i/shot00040k.jpg/" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224130533im_/http://img704.imageshack.us/img704/9839/shot00040k.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224130533/http://img192.imageshack.us/i/shot00032w.jpg/" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224130533im_/http://img192.imageshack.us/img192/8012/shot00032w.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224130533/http://img39.imageshack.us/i/shot00028e.jpg/" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224130533im_/http://img39.imageshack.us/img39/5498/shot00028e.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224130533/http://img101.imageshack.us/i/shot00027u.jpg/" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224130533im_/http://img101.imageshack.us/img101/8937/shot00027u.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br /><br />I hope you enjoy!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p224794" date="Posted: Thu Jun 10, 2010 9:16 pm "><author>David_020</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Very interesting.

I also play on 1440x900 and had no problems with the font. I'll enlarge them a bit! <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224130533im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br />There's many other stuff as well. The mainmenu was just a quickly slapped on logo, the sound for the ID logo got borked and I need to restore it. <br /><br />The scanner font is intended to be too small to read, the coordinates are jibberish in any case (just the endposition coordinates of the trace I use to identify entities with).</div>]]></body></post><post id="p224818" date="Posted: Fri Jun 11, 2010 10:08 pm "><author>adasdasf</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">It's awesome! Great Work! Hope you will do more maps;<br />Anyway, before the release, i thought you are in some kind of Mechanical Suit (just like this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224130533/http://img351.imageshack.us/img351/4075/mechwarrior4rl.png" class="postlink">http://img351.imageshack.us/img351/4075/mechwarrior4rl.png</a> but you are in some kind of HoverShip. And a hovership already flies so then the lifts do not makes much sense. <br /><br />Anyway , you did an awesome job in a small amount of time, looking for a version with more maps, maybe dialogs, cutscenes etc.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p224819" date="Posted: Fri Jun 11, 2010 10:21 pm "><author>BloodRayne</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks! <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224130533im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />It's actually a robot that has very limited lift capabilities, much like how a hovercraft can't fly. I was hoping to add some kind of particle effect to the SP model, will do that perhaps.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p224821" date="Posted: Sat Jun 12, 2010 3:55 am "><author>The Happy Friar</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Go figure...

Small, very blurry.  I was at 1440x900 Ultra Quality, 4X AA, all advanced FX enabled.  Same settings now.
