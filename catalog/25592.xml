Most of the screens are "final" which opposes to "wip". All development screenshots ARE STILL in the replies, so nothing is actually being lost, it's just for user's convenience</span><br /><br />Preview:<br /><img

There are some scripted events too, but not too many since there's not too much done. (A good example is the decontamination process at the beginning).<br />Guis, Sure there are lots of them (some interactive, some not). Particle effects and fx (sparks for instance), there will be lots of them also.<br />About vents, you even have to crawl through the vent ducts to get into the machineroom lol, since there's no way to do so because the doors are locked. Well, I don't want to spoil it, there are many more to come when I've got something else done. The map is still in its 'beginning' stage...<br />Glad you liked it though</div>]]></body></post><post id="p239938" date="Posted: Sat Jun 16, 2012 3:18 pmÂ "><author>Gzegzolka</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">No problem <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20121109024839im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> I hope that one day I could play it.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p240402" date="Posted: Mon Jul 02, 2012 4:14 amÂ "><author>chimueloeldragon2011</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">The post has been updated, there are more screenshots to come soon!

As for the gameplay, this will be some kind of scary/suspence low paced gameplay. As you see and as you realized, there are those Dead Spacey guis all over the place (in fact that game inspired me, I love it). Those 'message stations' are there for one reason: immersion. The goal is to immerse the player within the environment as much as possible. I'm glad you liked the idea! As for the textures, I'll see which ones would fit better <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20121109024839im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p240420" date="Posted: Mon Jul 02, 2012 6:22 pmÂ "><author>Tron</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I'm often very guilty myself of trying to get that super well lit look, just doesn't suit this engine though most of the time, better to play up to its strengths and get some nice dramatic light angles that play up the normal mapping and shadows. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20121109024839im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p240421" date="Posted: Mon Jul 02, 2012 6:52 pmÂ "><author>Zombie13</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Too be honest I wouldn't remove the ambient light completely.<br /><br />Just adjust the values so it's just bright up enough so you can just make out objects in the dark with no lights around it.<br /><br />That is basically what I do and it makes a big difference, but still keeps that dark doom look/feeling.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p240422" date="Posted: Mon Jul 02, 2012 7:13 pmÂ "><author>chimueloeldragon2011</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I've removed the ambient light shader from the map.

It really nails that balance between geometry and material detail, which is what makes the nicest looking idtech 4 environments in my opinion.  It's something I wish I was a lot better at, kudos to you <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20121109024839im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />As for the ambient light.  I kind of like the idea of having it, I just thought that it was excessive in some areas.  So like zombie suggested, just tone it down so the really flat appearance is diminished and you'll be sweet!</div>]]></body></post></posts></thread></xml>
