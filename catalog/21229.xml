I have Half-life 2 and episode 1, as well CS source and DOD source on the pc and it would be awsome if i could get the visuals for those games. My friend has episode 2 for the pc and he told my that the game updated the visuals for his other STEAM/Source games as well. Is there like an update or something that updated the visuals for my Source engine games, without having to buy episode 2 for the pc? I already have that game with the orange box on my Xbox 360.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p195371" date="Posted: Thu Feb 21, 2008 6:58 pm "><author>The Happy Friar</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">from what I understand is that the engine is the same for all.  The updates are game/mod specific, so you need that game/mod to get the updates to work in the previous games.

They added HDR and it most likely runs on the Source 2007 engine (Ep2).<br /><br />I don't know if this updated content will ever see the light of day on Steam, but I remember Valve saying a few years ago that they will update HL2's graphics when suitable hardware is available. Downloading all the modified maps and textures might be a huge download, but if it would be made optional, I'd have nothing against it (I'd love to replay the whole thing with such updates).<br /><br />Currently, HL2 and Episode One run on the Ep1 engine. Episode Two (Portal and TF2 too) runs on the 2007 engine. Right now, the SourceSDK is available for both and Valve promised the old engine will go away soon.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p195369" date="Posted: Thu Feb 21, 2008 6:28 pm "><author>hardcore_gamer</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">OK, so i got the Orange box for my Xbox 360 and the first thing i saw when i started playing was that the visuals were allot better.<br />Is there any way to apply the improved visuals to the Pc version?
