<br /><br />They are, but some people tend to send pm's to the wrong guys and wonder why they get banned.
<br /><br />I don't check pm's although I could, but I do think everything "private" is none of my business.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p117008" date="Posted: Thu Oct 20, 2005 8:10 pm "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Brain Trepaning wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I meant any PM's I "may" have sent asking for WAREZ!!

<br /><br />No, they're not.  Somewhat along the lines of email, they're stored in plaintext for their entire life.  In terms of PMs on phpbb, they're stored in plaintext in the database.  This means that for the most part, they're private between you and the recipient, since those are the only two people that the php serves the text up to.  However, anyone with full database access rights (like BNA) can use a more raw method of database viewing to see all private messages that are still stored in the DB (anything that's not been deleted by both parties).</div>]]></body></post><post id="p117340" date="Posted: Sat Oct 22, 2005 7:30 am "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">bb_matt wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Just pulling your leg <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081204151040im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>

<br /><br />Privacy is ensured by my obligatory decision to fully respect it, not by technology. Listing all the text messages is always only one click away from me and for legal entities suing their way into D3W by claiming it's a functioning infrastructure to trade warez.

<br /><br />Yes, we'll be the only forum where people have to mail me the retina of their right eye to get access.
<br /><br />Seriously, no need to take it further - it is a reminder of our stance on this topic.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p120562" date="Posted: Mon Nov 07, 2005 8:14 pm "><author>Foebane</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">What if I want to promote a program I wrote myself and am selling it as shareware?

<br /><br />You can promote your work - I guess it's not hard to understand the difference between stolen software and your work.</div>]]></body></post></posts></thread></xml>
