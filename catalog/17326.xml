Okay, using the skybox tutorial, I made a skybox, once, a long time ago. I can probably do it again given some time. The thing is the box was just all stars, so it was extremely easy to assemble.&#13;
<br/><br/>
My question is, how can I get extremely realistic custom skyboxes with landscape, mountains, or just a large nebula and a star nearby? How do I align everything right? Are there some special programs to do that with? Any way I can get one of those programs for free that'll do what I want?</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

It's free version that you can use to render extremely nice skyboxes. The free version has some limits on the texture resolution you can use but even so it's very useful.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Here's a neat script for it that takes 6 snapshots of your terragen scene and lines up them up perfectly. Then you can just take those 6 images and use them in your skybox.&#13;

If you're aiming for realism, you'll have to do some image editing.
