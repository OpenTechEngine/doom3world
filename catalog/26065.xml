The worldstudio seems to be DoomEdit, copied straight from original Doom3. The compiler requires resources from original Doom 3 to convert them to BFG Edition format, it saves converted ones in base/generated folder. <br /><br />I compiled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319215855/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iN5qryQzcYI" class="postlink">Investigation map</a>, and when I try to load it, I get this:<br /><br />ERROR: While linking GLSL program 35 with vertexShader heatHazeWithMask.vfp and fragmentShader heatHazeWithMask.vfp<br />Fragment shader contains a user varying, but is linked without a vertex shader.<br /><br />If I attempt again, I get the same error, but the program number is different: 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43...<br /><br />I did set com_smp to 0.<br /><br />Managed to load <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319215855/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJWdlI6y8iE" class="postlink">Industrial Environment map</a>.

Then it gives the aforementioned error, so I have to restart the program.<br /><br />@motorsep: if I understand correctly, you need Microsoft Visual Studio Professional 2012 in order to compile it. Or find somewhere the "MFC" files (afxwin.h, afxdisp.h and others) and somehow add them to Express installation.<br /><br />For me, Visual Studio 2010 Express couldn't open Taken.sln file, saying that it requires a newer version. 2012 Express couldn't compile, because it didn't find files which actually were in the code. One of them was precompiled.h. Eventually I solved this problem by copying everything to c:\Doom3 folder, but then it reported that aforementioned "MFC" files are missing. This is where I gave up.<br /><br />And finally, jmarshall23, thanks for your work! I'm certainly interested in a tool which converts Doom3 maps to BFG maps, and will continue my tests once improved .exe becomes available.<br /><br />I also plan to grab my collection of Doom3 single player maps and try and find one which works with the current .exe. I'll post here if I ever do this and find it. I already tried Obi-Wan map01 and it dind't work.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p245021" date="Posted: Thu Dec 27, 2012 6:04 pm "><author>motorsep</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">NX-317 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">@motorsep: if I understand correctly, you need Microsoft Visual Studio Professional 2012 in order to compile it.

I've just ran a search, and there are no files that have "heathaze" in the file name there.
