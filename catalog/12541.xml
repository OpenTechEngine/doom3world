<br /><br />I've seen the wellknown 'fish' tutorial and I thought 'that doesn't look that hard'. Maybe I was wrong, or maybe I missed something some keys pressed that weren't in the video. But I can't seem to get my zsphere models to be symmetrical. I am using the mirror edit mode and the zspheresetup seems to be totally symmetrical. But when I preview it in adaptive mesh mode there no love. This frelled up model comes out.
<br /><br />I've been following the instructions but it's not doing it for me. I must be missing some basic concept. Someone please help me.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205105323im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /><br /><br />In this instance the zsphere model looks like a pacman kind of figure, the model should come out looking like that but instead it looks like an alien from Daikatana 3... I just want to make a really basic symmetrical model, modelled in zspheres that I can refine and export. How do I make my zsphere models symmetrical (like the fish in the fish movie). Can I lock the modeling axis' somewhere?

<br /><br />That is not a good tutorial at all.
<br /><br />I don't have time to explain zspheres here, but I think your problems is becuase you added your side spheres, and drag them into the mesh, out to the other side, try to switch the position of the 2 side spheres, by using the move tool.
<br /><br />The Zscript tutorials on zspheres is what you should look at.
<br /><br />Zbrush user interface is different, you need to learn the basics, before you start using zspheres <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205105323im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Everything you need should be in this thread.

<br /><br />I don't have time to explain zspheres here, but I think your problems is becuase you added your side spheres, and drag them into the mesh, out to the other side, try to switch the position of the 2 side spheres, by using the move tool.

<br /><br />I've seen the wellknown 'fish' tutorial and I thought 'that doesn't look that hard'. Maybe I was wrong, or maybe I missed something some keys pressed that weren't in the video. But I can't seem to get my zsphere models to be symmetrical. I am using the mirror edit mode and the zspheresetup seems to be totally symmetrical. But when I preview it in adaptive mesh mode there no love. This frelled up model comes out.
<br /><br />I've been following the instructions but it's not doing it for me. I must be missing some basic concept. Someone please help me.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /><br /><br />In this instance the zsphere model looks like a pacman kind of figure, the model should come out looking like that but instead it looks like an alien from Daikatana 3... I just want to make a really basic symmetrical model, modelled in zspheres that I can refine and export. How do I make my zsphere models symmetrical (like the fish in the fish movie). Can I lock the modeling axis' somewhere?

<br /><br />That is not a good tutorial at all.
<br /><br />I don't have time to explain zspheres here, but I think your problems is becuase you added your side spheres, and drag them into the mesh, out to the other side, try to switch the position of the 2 side spheres, by using the move tool.
<br /><br />The Zscript tutorials on zspheres is what you should look at.
<br /><br />Zbrush user interface is different, you need to learn the basics, before you start using zspheres <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Everything you need should be in this thread.

But I didn't drag them through the original sphere. I used x-mirror editing and drew a new child in edit mode. That made the two legs, I only moved them very slightly, certainly not through the mesh. I'm familiour with the basics, went through the tuts in zsphere and read most threads.
<br /><br />What I'm missing is how I can lock movement when I'm modeling to a certain angle. e.g. when I moved the leg-childsphere down they also rotated slight inward, this rotates the mesh as well. I want to move them down without them rotating. 
<br /><br />So basically my problem is, whenever I move a childpshere, the mesh gets distorted somehow by rotating.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p113811" date="Posted: Sat Sep 24, 2005 8:14 am "><author>1eyed</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Hmm I can't reproduce this, I tried to make the same shape. but I can't make get the same error, my spheres were rotated differently though.  You could have a twist from rotated zspheres.
<br /><br />It looks like you used a very low intersection value in the adptive skin. Try to change the adaptive skin settings too.
<br /><br />I think the spheres rotate when you move them, so that you don't get twisting, but you have to rotate them manually sometimes.
