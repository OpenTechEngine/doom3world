<br />I will play this map with a friend online.
<br />Do anybody know a multiplayer map tutorial ?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p30941" date="Posted: Mon Aug 09, 2004 1:09 am "><author>karttoon</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">After spending many hours trying to get this to work I finally figured it out.
<br /><br />Step 1: Put in multiplayer spawn points
<br />Step 2: Modify your maps.def file, add this at the end
<br />Example:
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">mapDef game/mp/&lt;your map name with no extensions&gt; {<br />	"name"		"&lt;your map description"<br />	"Deathmatch"		"1"<br />	"Team DM"		"1"<br />	"Last Man"		"1"<br />	"Tourney"		"1"<br />	"size0"		"93855710"<br />	"size1"		"93855710"<br />	"size2"		"156267217"<br />	"size3"		"237413960"<br />}</span>
<br /><br />The size part I don't understand yet but I just used the same size as the map before it. Place the map in the dir. you selected, in this case, game/mp/. If you don't want to change your maps.def in the pak files then just make a "def" folder in your base dir.
<br /><br />Step 3: Distribute your map
<br />Step 4: Play your map
<br /><br />That should do it, good luck!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p30965" date="Posted: Mon Aug 09, 2004 1:43 am "><author>rich_is_bored</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Good find. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100522163307im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Have you verified that packaging your map in a PK4 works? It would be best to keep people from modifying Doom 3's vanilla content to make their MP maps work.
<br /><br />To be more specific I'm talking about packaging the definition aswell as the map in a PK4.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p30987" date="Posted: Mon Aug 09, 2004 2:01 am "><author>korn</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">karttoon wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Step 2: Modify your maps.def file, add this at the end<br /></div>
<br /><br />No, i would not suggest that, that would overwrite the maps.def in some cases (depending on pk4 name) and that would cause problems for people try'n to host a server. what you need todo, is make a new mymap.def file, and add those lines like you said, and put that in the defs folder within your pk4</div>]]></body></post><post id="p30991" date="Posted: Mon Aug 09, 2004 2:03 am "><author>Iced_Eagle</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Try these two tutorials guys.

<br /><br />That is how to package the map in your own PK4 and be selectable in-game.

<br /><br />That is how to add a levelshot to your map, view other video tutorial before this one.

<br /><br />You can delete those size values I believe.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p31013" date="Posted: Mon Aug 09, 2004 2:51 am "><author>MNeMiC</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">thoose tutorials are great, however I can't find any other video tutorials for Doom 3 on fileplanet, is there any more and how do I get there?

<br /><br />It works. You can call it 'mymap.def' or 'ook.def' or anything, as long as the mapDef is inside of it, and the .def file is in a folder called 'defs' inside of the .pk4</div>]]></body></post><post id="p31029" date="Posted: Mon Aug 09, 2004 3:15 am "><author>karttoon</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Ah cool, thanks for the extra info <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100522163307im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p31040" date="Posted: Mon Aug 09, 2004 3:28 am "><author>Iced_Eagle</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Here are some video tutorials.

<br /><br />For those, watch the last 2 in opposite order or else you will miss steps on packaging and folder naming conventions.

<br /><br />The maps show up in the lists, lets me start them up and play but when someone tries to connect it says their missing a media file. I've given them the exact pak files so what could be the issue?
<br /><br />Tried my way listed above but got the same issue
<br /><br />*Edit*
<br />Gotta go to work right now but before I do, some stuff I noticed. When people were trying to connect and it sent a heart beat to them it used random ports to try and connecto ti me so it might be that they didn't specify 27666? Also, I didn't have an initial DM spawn point and it gave a warning about that.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p34008" date="Posted: Thu Aug 12, 2004 6:52 pm "><author>VizoR</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">my map shows up in the mp list with the pic there but when i start and it comes to the loading screen it doesn show up. when its done loading i scroll up a bit and it says that it couldnt load the image? why could it do it on the mp list but not on the loading screen?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p34100" date="Posted: Thu Aug 12, 2004 8:54 pm "><author>swampfox</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">VizoR, in your pk4, add a folder called "loading" in your "guis" folder, and put the image you want on the loading screen inside.

Make sure to leave the "guis/assets/splash/yourpicture" or the picture wont show up in the map list.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p34116" date="Posted: Thu Aug 12, 2004 9:14 pm "><author>VizoR</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">but i got my assets/splash/mypic in the background under windofDef BackgroundImage....? so the only way to add the loading is to replace the splash =/ im prolly missing something. can u explain some more plz? =) or paste the code to see what it looks like.. thx</div>]]></body></post><post id="p34126" date="Posted: Thu Aug 12, 2004 9:34 pm "><author>swampfox</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Heh, I guess my post was a little unclear and wordy... let me try again.
<br /><br />It seems that if you have the guis/assets/splash/mypic in the .pk4, it will display in the map list on its own, even with no reference to it anywhere in the .gui file. 
<br /><br />If you add the guis/loading/mypic to your .pk4, then change the .gui so you have:
<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">windowDef BackgroundImage<br />   {<br />      rect   0,0,640,480<br />      visible   1<br />      background   "guis/loading/mypic"<br />      matcolor   1,1,1,1<br />   }<br /></div>
<br /><br />(or whatever other numbers you have in there) it should show in loading screen. I guess Doom just doesn't like reading the background image from anywhere other than a guis/loading folder.
<br /><br />Try it, let me know if it works or if I just got mine to work by some fluke.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p34141" date="Posted: Thu Aug 12, 2004 9:47 pm "><author>VizoR</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">aaaah.. u were right. it does load the splash pic on its own as long as it is in there. i noticed it cause i had misspelled "guis" and had "gui/assets/splash/mypic" but it still loaded. i did what u said and the loading screen now works! <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100522163307im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> thx alot!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p34166" date="Posted: Thu Aug 12, 2004 10:08 pm "><author>swampfox</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Believe it or not, I also misspelled gui the same way about a dozen times, and it was the biggest problem I had in getting this to work!

<br /><br />ie:  d3ed_basic_room_clean_tscc.avi
<br /><br />windows media player 9 says Windows Media Player encountered an unknown error.
