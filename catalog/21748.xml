You didn't get that with the second method I gave you. (if you do, it won't match up with the grid, and it'll be problematic for you further down the line instead) It'll stretch a little bit, but it'll hardly be noticeable.<br /><br />Just divide it up into the grids separate parts. In this case. the slip is 1/16 of the full texture. Ergo 0.0625 is the value you want for horizontal in the "fit". Then after doing the fit, just move it along horizontally till you got it to match up. In this case, you should be fine just move it it 0.5 texture lengths once. (standard value)</div>]]></body></post><post id="p202004" date="Posted: Tue Jul 15, 2008 10:18 am "><author>bashport</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">The sloppy edge isn't a single object.
