<br /><br />Given that, I thought it would be a good idea to list them all here to it's easier for people to help level designers; there are more screenshots on each level's thread, and most of them are downloadable. Maybe not all of them will take part in the contest, but I guess constructive feedback can still be a good thing (be sure to reply to the map thread themselves though).

<br /><br />Quote: <span style="font-style: italic">I'm proud to present "A Ladder To Heaven" - a small Q4 duel/tourney map featuring "old school" style with a lot of vertical fighting, smart and fast paced gameplay. Currently it's in alpha stage, temporary set of textures was used, but work with layout and item placement seems to be done at this stage and it needs a lot of playtesting to be turned into beta :&gt;</span>

<br /><br />Quote: <span style="font-style: italic">The map is ideally made for 1on1 DM, or 3on3 TDM. The inspiration was the sort of 'floating castles' featured in many fantasy novels, integrated with the harsh industrial style of Quake 4 for more of an 'oil rig' theme to it. Unfortuantely due to the rules against custom models the Rock Formations were made completely from splines, greatly harming performance.<br /><br />As I say though this is my first ever multiplayer map so wasn't expecting too much, if anyone could give advice on how something like this could be enhanced visually though that'd be muchly appreciated! Cheers</span>

<br /><br />Quote: <span style="font-style: italic">A geo-comp style atrium map for TDM or tourney modes. The original idea was to emphasise the importance of geometry, brushwork and good construction technique in a Q4 map over a the heavy dependance on texturing that is so often seen. Whilst sticking to this brief it was important that the resulting level remained enjoyable and competitive to play. Whilst not a typical Q4 map, given the limitations of the id Software community map pack competition (ie no custom content), the level achieves its aims.</span>

<br /><br />Quote: <span style="font-style: italic">The map is designed specifically for tourney mode, but TDM and straight DM play is also supported. This level makes use of the recently release Q1 style gothic textures. By far the majority of Q4 maps are tech or base in style. Although limiting the map to only standard Q4 materials and assets could have resulted in a lack of options for a gothic styled level, use of architecture and decal textures meant that the map appears to have a much wider variation in texturing than it really has. Although a fairly small level, this entry has a classic look and layout.</span>

<br /><br />Quote: <span style="font-style: italic">Its a tdm map with the focus on competive gameplay and its gonna be my Q4CMP entrance.<br /><br />The layout is pretty much done... we been beta testing it for the last week and so far so good <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> The visuals on the other side are not done and I recommend using r_forceambient 1 while playing it atm. I hope i can get some constructive critism here that consurns items, spawns, ammo, minor layout stuffs and like places that feels wrong on the map.</span>

<br /><br />That's it for now. Did I forget some map, both posted on D3W or on other website/forum? Do some author want a change or a map to be removed? If so, play say so in the comments or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/privmsg.php?mode=post&amp;u=1543" class="postlink">via PM</a> and I'll update this post.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p167981" date="Posted: Sun Jan 21, 2007 8:27 pmÂ "><author>kat</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I've got two missing images from the above, GODLIKE's and Copperheads images aren't showing up atm.

<br /><br />Re : me and the comp, yes I'm doing something but won't be releasing any info till final week, doing quite a bit of 'private' testing atm though. There's also another mapper (Donkey) submitting possibly two maps, Lukin may be doing so as well although the one you posted above seens to be the main one he's submitting. Have a look on the Quake3World LEM forums for the info (incomplete though it may be)</div>]]></body></post><post id="p167997" date="Posted: Sun Jan 21, 2007 11:14 pmÂ "><author>bolleh</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">nice list!

<br /><br />And finally, the deadline for the contest is today. I tested/saw some maps that were top notch visually, and while I couldn't play them in a real competitive DM environment, I've seen some authors doing pretty lengthy beta testing... so I'm confident there'll be great new additions to Q4 with this pack.
<br /><br />Good luck to all level designers!</div>]]></body></post></posts></thread></xml>
