<br /><br />but doom3 has to have some railing prefabs/models or somethin?
<br /><br />any ideas?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p30936" date="Posted: Mon Aug 09, 2004 12:52 am "><author>Coolbreeze78</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100522161758/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=3214">http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=3214</a><!-- m -->

<br /><br />CRASH RAILING COURSE!
<br /><br />1. Turn a brush into a cylinder
<br />2. Rotate it so it's like a horizon line (i.e. you would be able to lean on it)
<br />3. Press "S" then check the "Subdivide Patch" box
<br />4. drag horizontal and vertical down to "1", your cylinder will now have 4 sides.
<br />5. Now lower the grid to about "2" then resize it in the top view as far as it will go, also resize the height to almost bottom.
<br /><br />You should now have a pretty thin railing. You can copy and rotate it vertically to use it as poles so you cannot crouch under.
<br /><br />To create a bend on the end duplicate the bar you've created then press "S" and change the "Vertical Subdivisions" to about 5 or lower then use the patch bend system (B, or press the button near the top-right). Hopefully this made some sort of sense, post if you get stuck.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p30959" date="Posted: Mon Aug 09, 2004 1:31 am "><author>neutrino</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Ya, four sided cylinders is how Id made them. Also, turn them 45 degrees so they make a diamond shape instead of sitting flat. That way the player is usually looking at a corner and the smoothing effect will make them appear rounded.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p34490" date="Posted: Fri Aug 13, 2004 6:37 am "><author>bigp3rm</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Four sided cylinder? lol

<br /><br />It does something with the bumpmapping to give the affect of a round railing, but its realy only 4 sides. Its almost impossible to be able to tell that the railing is square with "square cylinders" (in the patch menu).

<br /><br />your best bet is use the mesh "cylinder" and take time to make your fancy rail, save it as a prefab.
<br /><br />I say use meshes cuz they have nice bending abilities.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p38585" date="Posted: Thu Aug 19, 2004 11:22 pm "><author>JustinBailey</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">You can open up one of id's maps and just copy the rails out of there (rails that are made out of patches, at least) and paste them into yours, then just use vertex manipulator to bend them however you want.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p54323" date="Posted: Thu Sep 30, 2004 6:23 pm "><author>evilartist</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">What textures make good for railing?

<br /><br />You might want to try looking in base_trim. Also depends on what "style" of railing that you're going for and what the theme of your map is. So, you might have to do some experimenting.

<br /><br />Pic 1:
<br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100522161758im_/http://home.earthlink.net/~johnny0t/images/railing1.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><br />Pic 2:
<br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100522161758im_/http://home.earthlink.net/~johnny0t/images/railing2.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />And a ladder on the same map:
<br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100522161758im_/http://home.earthlink.net/~johnny0t/images/ladder1.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><br />I used the technique described by Str4dog. I just made cylinder patch meshes and assembled them as required, easy as pie. The only difference is that I used an 8 sided cylinder instead of a 4 sided "cylinder".
<br />The grid makes doing the 90's a breeze, and alignment is easy enough using various views.
<br /><br />On those examples I used the "textures/base_trim/yelhaz2" texture.
<br /><br />I just noticed that on the last picture you can see that the textures don't align properly on two of the pieces. The way I fixed that was by selecting all the railing at the same time (quite a bit in this instance) and reapplying the texture, then selecting the surface inspector tool, and hit the "natural" button.
<br /><br />Hope this helps a little bit.
<br /><br /><br />Johnny</div>]]></body></post><post id="p54688" date="Posted: Sat Oct 02, 2004 7:51 am "><author>Friction</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I'd say your railing is way too thick.

<br /><br />The straight pieces are obviously easy - draw out a standard cylinder (not a square one) and set the subdivisions along it's length to 1 for both vertical and horizontal.
<br /><br />The 90degree angles or 45degree angles are more difficult.
<br />You can use the bend tool, but sometimes, you'll be off the grid - not that much of a big deal if your not looking for exact accuracy.
<br /><br />You can use that method or a combination of it and the info below.
<br /><br />What you want to do, for a 2 unit diameter railings, is set your grid to 1 unit and follow the info here :-

<br /><br />Then, subdivide to suit - diameter will have 1 subdivision to match the straight pieces, along the length of the curve can be 3 subdivisions which will look smooth enough - set it higher for a smoother look.</div>]]></body></post></posts></thread></xml>
