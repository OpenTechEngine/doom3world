<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Moving Ladder without script</span>
<br /><br />This tutorial aims to show how to make a ladder come down without using scripts.
<br /><br />1) Make a x=384 y=384 z=256 box room, with a platform half way up, a light and a player start
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071110230109/http://img467.imageshack.us/my.php?image=d3pic1sv8.jpg" class="postlink">http://img467.imageshack.us/my.php?image=d3pic1sv8.jpg</a>
<br /><br />2) Make a ladder with cylinders, using any texture you want, and place it next to the platform

<br /><br />3) Select all the parts, go to the entity window, select func_door from the list and click create. This turns it into a door. Move it up so it is out of the reach of the player, and add these key/val pairs:
<br /><br />movedir -2
<br />time 1
<br />locked 1
<br />wait -1

<br /><br />4) Creat a brush the same size as the ladder. Then put the grid to 1, and make the front of the brush (the side the player will climb) 1 unit infront of the ladder. This is so when it comes down you can still climb the ladder.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071110230109/http://img356.imageshack.us/my.php?image=d3pic4gn8.jpg" class="postlink">http://img356.imageshack.us/my.php?image=d3pic4gn8.jpg</a>
<br /><br />5) Give this brush the ladder texture and bind it to the ladder.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071110230109/http://img356.imageshack.us/my.php?image=d3pic5it0.jpg" class="postlink">http://img356.imageshack.us/my.php?image=d3pic5it0.jpg</a>
<br /><br />6) Make a func static with the model <span style="font-weight: bold">models/mapobjects/guiobjects/techdrpanel1/techdrpanel1.lwo</span>
<br />and with the gui
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">guis/alphalabs2/ladder.gui</span>
<br />and place it on a wall near the ladder.
<br />Deselect everything, then select the panel followed by the ladder and press Shift + k. This then targets the panel at the ladder.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071110230109/http://img162.imageshack.us/my.php?image=d3pic6wq5.jpg" class="postlink">http://img162.imageshack.us/my.php?image=d3pic6wq5.jpg</a>
<br /><br />7) Save and compile the map. Then run it. At first the player cant reach the ladder.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071110230109/http://img162.imageshack.us/my.php?image=d3pic7ud9.jpg" class="postlink">http://img162.imageshack.us/my.php?image=d3pic7ud9.jpg</a>
<br /><br />But then you press the button on the panel, and the ladder comes down.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071110230109/http://img162.imageshack.us/my.php?image=d3pic8sx3.jpg" class="postlink">http://img162.imageshack.us/my.php?image=d3pic8sx3.jpg</a>
<br /><br />And then you can climb up it!
