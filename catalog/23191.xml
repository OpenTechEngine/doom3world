Some started out with big ideas (which is good, I did the same). The thing is though, that modding always takes a lot more work than anticipated, and it takes knowledge covering a myriad of expertises. <br /><br />As an example, we were hoping to make Hexen:Edge of Chaos in the timespan of 1-2 years, we're in year 5 of development...<br /><br />Those new modders that came with very little experience and tried to start big projects all failed, simply because it was way too hard. This is a big shame, because it means that perhaps very talented modders have dropped out simply because the work was too difficult and daunting.<br /><br />Most of those modders that came and started out small, knowing nothing at first, but starting with simple things (change the color of a shirt, create a simple weaopn mod etc..) are still around and are now experienced modders.<br /><br />I'm trying to say this as kindly as I can, because I don't want to drive away people, but you'll be put off of modding soon if you try for something hard (what you want is hard). So I want to give you this tip: Make a simple mod, or 5 then think again about making this kind of larger mod. Otherwise you might be put off modding forever, which would be a shame.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p223669" date="Posted: Sat Apr 10, 2010 9:08 pm "><author>aardwolf</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I just got ETQW brand new, so my interest in joining this mod is increased again.  <img src="/web/20100702042956im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />   BTW BloodRayne, would you have an opening for a mapper for Edge of Chaos still?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p223673" date="Posted: Sat Apr 10, 2010 10:21 pm "><author>Deadite4</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I just got ETQW brand new, so my interest in joining this mod is increased again.

You do need to provide previous works though for consideration, that is always a requirement.  PM or come to our public forums to discuss further(I don't want to derail this thread any further).</div>]]></body></post><post id="p223675" date="Posted: Sun Apr 11, 2010 1:26 am "><author>Oneofthe8devilz</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">@morstua .. what you plan to do is indeed not easy but doable... your best bet would be trying to recruit some coders off the etqw forums...<br /><br />You better be skilled at putting an awesome storyboard together to get the people you need intrigued....<br /><br />About a year ago I pushed an ETQW project pretty far...<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="/web/20100702042956/http://www.moddb.com/mods/23rd-century-warfare">http://www.moddb.com/mods/23rd-century-warfare</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Good luck in finding what you are searching for...</div>]]></body></post><post id="p223677" date="Posted: Sun Apr 11, 2010 4:44 am "><author>aardwolf</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Oneofthe8devilz wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">@morstua .. what you plan to do is indeed not easy but doable... your best bet would be trying to recruit some coders off the etqw forums...<br /><br />You better be skilled at putting an awesome storyboard together to get the people you need intrigued....<br /><br />About a year ago I pushed an ETQW project pretty far...<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="/web/20100702042956/http://www.moddb.com/mods/23rd-century-warfare">http://www.moddb.com/mods/23rd-century-warfare</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Good luck in finding what you are searching for...</div><br /><br />I can offer my contributions as level maker/mapper.
