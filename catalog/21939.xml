I recently built a few models and skinned a couple of them, but I figure it may be better left to someone with more refined skills. I figure this project would be good for an artist looking to pad their own portfolio and I would certainly share the assets to enable this. Here are a few screenies of the model I'd like skinned. <br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081116180008im_/http://www.thegameexchange.org/Flash/XWing1.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081116180008im_/http://www.thegameexchange.org/Flash/XWing2.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081116180008im_/http://www.thegameexchange.org/Flash/XWing3.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081116180008im_/http://www.thegameexchange.org/Flash/XWing4.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />It's a 3DS Max file which I built in Max 7. If you could also uvw unwrap it that would be great, but if not I could do it and provide an image file with the uvw maps ready for painting. <br /><br />Please contact me through this forum or by email at <!-- e --><a href="mailto:tbarak@mts.net">tbarak@mts.net</a><!-- e --> if you're interested. Everyone is welcome but please be prepared to provide a sample or two. I don't mind working with new people but make sure you have some experience so the end result looks good. If you prefer skinning weapons I'm working on an AK-47 which will be ready for skinning in probably a week or two. Thanks in advance.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p204398" date="Posted: Mon Sep 01, 2008 11:57 pm "><author>DoV_Tomas</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Hi guys;<br /><br />I'm a level designer branching out into modeling and I'm building up my portfolio.
