First, i'd very much like to know how to get the models into lightwave to animate in the first place! <br /><br />I've done so with the shotgun simply because it was a static mesh with a base .lwo extension, but I can only get the mesh, I'm not sure how to attach all the normal maps spec maps etc to the model in lightwave. <br /><br />What I want to do right now though is find the multiplayer model for doom 3, import it into lightwave, animate it, and get it's animation and camera back into the game to play in a cutscene. <br /><br />Anyone have help, or one of those awesome links to modwiki?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p190255" date="Posted: Thu Oct 18, 2007 6:31 am "><author>rich_is_bored</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Good call.
