<br /><br />yes, yes! Just wow! You guys have blown me away, honestly. Top notch and even though it was just one map, I had an absolute blast! I think I am going to go replay it now a few more times, woohoo!.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p174203" date="Posted: Mon Mar 26, 2007 12:48 am "><author>Kristus</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Nice design, very well done. But I can't say I agree with the sounds or the music. Quake was a lot better there. But it's a great peice of work still.
<br /><br />Don't want to be a spoiler, but I thought it was a pity you didn't have anything after you finished the map. A picture or anything would  have been better than seeing the Doom3 splash-screen and then be dumped to the Doom3 Menu. :/ , Same thing when you die really. (Which I did once or twice. :p) Hadn't required much work to change the death GUI into being a bit more Quake.
<br /><br />But still, Kudos on a job well done.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p174204" date="Posted: Mon Mar 26, 2007 12:53 am "><author>TelMarine</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I actually enjoyed the music, but is there a way to turn it off? I looked under s_ console commands (in quake4 there is s_musicvolume i believe), but couldn't find anything.
<br /><br />Also I thought the sounds were good, but of course Quake original's were better. Quake probably has the best sounds of any id game in my opinion (thanks to Trent Reznor).</div>]]></body></post><post id="p174206" date="Posted: Mon Mar 26, 2007 1:00 am "><author>Skutarth</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Overall, this is a kick in the face. The map is perfect, and it needs no changes.

<br />I agree. There are some other things I don't like, though.
<br /><br />- Super Shotgun only uses one shell per shot when it should be two.
<br /><br />- The spread for both of the shotguns doesn't feel right, particularly on the Super Shotgun.
<br /><br />- The look of portals needs a little work. It at least needs the effects coming from them to be the same color.
<br /><br />- The axe makes a noise when you take it out, and the surface hit noise sound is the flashlight's. It also has an animation of it being raised while the other weapons don't.
<br /><br />- You can only gib the zombies. This is just a nag, but one of the things I thought was great in the original Quake was that every single one of the non-boss monsters could be gibbed.
<br /><br />- Lightning gun should be done in a different way, it shouldn't sway when moving (at least while shooting) and the trail effect shouldn't be part of the first person gun model. Also, it shows bullet hits. I know it's not done because it's not normally in the game, but I thought I'd give a suggestion.
<br /><br />I hope that, in the future, you guys make more maps. That, and multiplayer.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p174210" date="Posted: Mon Mar 26, 2007 1:27 am "><author>kat</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">There's a problem with the ZIP file itself. I downloaded it twice to check and got the same error... double clicking the ZIP file to open it in WinZip return and incomplete/invalid archive error. However, renaming the ZIP to PK4 and then open that seemed to work so I'm not sure what's wrong there - what did you guys ue to pack the files up?
<br /><br />[EDIT]WTF?! I've got PK4 files inside PK4 files!!? I hope this is just some freak error due to me not being able to open the file --- if not, OMG you guys should know better than that. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225063049im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225063049im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /><br /><br />[EDIT 2]Yup yup, seems to be a problem associated with WinZip having a difficulties with the file.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p174211" date="Posted: Mon Mar 26, 2007 1:37 am "><author>Kristus</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I just opened the zip with WinRar and extracted it. 
<br /><br />Seems to be something with the Zip though, because geX had the same problem. 
<br />What program are you using Kat?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p174213" date="Posted: Mon Mar 26, 2007 1:52 am "><author>kat</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Kristus : I'm using WinZip. What was the folder structure like inside WinRar? (hmmm WinRar opens and sees the files correctly so that file multipacking error must be related to WinZip)
<br /><br />Also another general note for the guys... I'd strongly suggest you pack this up so that it's extracted into it's own 'mod' folder - 'Quake' - to encourage 'proper' mods and maps for it... leaving it 'open' the way it is (just dropping a PK4  into the base folder) is just asking for trouble with all sorts of conflict/overwrite errors when people try making stuff for it (which they will)
<br /><br />It's nicely done so far though, the quality is certainly there. The only crit is that it's very, very dark; I was playing in a darkened room and it was still dark, even turning out the lights didn't help much (never played the original so can't make any comparative crits)</div>]]></body></post><post id="p174215" date="Posted: Mon Mar 26, 2007 2:04 am "><author>CrimsonHead</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I had a problem at first, Windows would'nt open it, then I openend it with winrar and extracted the file, renamed that file to a zip and opened it,  then I copied the "quake" folder inside to my doom3 folder. 
<br /><br />I just finished playing the whole thing, that really brought back some good memories. It looked really beautiful, it was actually pretty difficult for me I kept dying a lot. The music was good, I would have liked it better if it would have shifted to something slow and sinister during non-action. One thing I did miss is I wanted to hear that big heavy clanking sound when you launch grenades. A few small gripes here and there, overall this is the best mod/level for Doom³ so far. I really want more, I hope some people will make some more maps for this. This is some really awesome work, thank you!!!
<br /><br />btw....I can't for the life of me figure out how to get the quad damage, could someone give me like a hint or something?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p174219" date="Posted: Mon Mar 26, 2007 3:17 am "><author>vinnie_jones</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">the zip is corrupted???  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225063049im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p174221" date="Posted: Mon Mar 26, 2007 3:39 am "><author>Quaker-X</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Glad everyone likes the mod!
<br /><br />Wish we could have put more levels and content into it. We had so much planned, but with our work and lives its really, really hard to squeeze time in for this stuff.

<br /><br />yes, yes! Just wow! You guys have blown me away, honestly. Top notch and even though it was just one map, I had an absolute blast!

But I can't say I agree with the sounds or the music. Quake was a lot better there. But it's a great peice of work still.
<br /><br />Don't want to be a spoiler, but I thought it was a pity you didn't have anything after you finished the map. A picture or anything would  have been better than seeing the Doom3 splash-screen and then be dumped to the Doom3 Menu. :/ , Same thing when you die really. (Which I did once or twice. :p) Hadn't required much work to change the death GUI into being a bit more Quake.

<br />I agree. There are some other things I don't like, though.
<br /><br />- Super Shotgun only uses one shell per shot when it should be two.
<br /><br />- The spread for both of the shotguns doesn't feel right, particularly on the Super Shotgun.
<br /><br />- The look of portals needs a little work. It at least needs the effects coming from them to be the same color.
<br /><br />- The axe makes a noise when you take it out, and the surface hit noise sound is the flashlight's. It also has an animation of it being raised while the other weapons don't.
<br /><br />- You can only gib the zombies. This is just a nag, but one of the things I thought was great in the original Quake was that every single one of the non-boss monsters could be gibbed.
<br /><br />- Lightning gun should be done in a different way, it shouldn't sway when moving (at least while shooting) and the trail effect shouldn't be part of the first person gun model. Also, it shows bullet hits. I know it's not done because it's not normally in the game, but I thought I'd give a suggestion.
<br /><br />I hope that, in the future, you guys make more maps. That, and multiplayer.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p174210" date="Posted: Mon Mar 26, 2007 1:27 am "><author>kat</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">There's a problem with the ZIP file itself.

What was the folder structure like inside WinRar? (hmmm WinRar opens and sees the files correctly so that file multipacking error must be related to WinZip)
<br /><br />Also another general note for the guys... I'd strongly suggest you pack this up so that it's extracted into it's own 'mod' folder - 'Quake' - to encourage 'proper' mods and maps for it... leaving it 'open' the way it is (just dropping a PK4  into the base folder) is just asking for trouble with all sorts of conflict/overwrite errors when people try making stuff for it (which they will)
<br /><br />It's nicely done so far though, the quality is certainly there.

The music was good, I would have liked it better if it would have shifted to something slow and sinister during non-action. One thing I did miss is I wanted to hear that big heavy clanking sound when you launch grenades. A few small gripes here and there, overall this is the best mod/level for Doom³ so far. I really want more, I hope some people will make some more maps for this. This is some really awesome work, thank you!!!

I've only played through it once, but I very much enjoyed the feel of the weapons, enemies, and how the map was laid out.
<br /><br />I only played on Marine (I think, I launched the mod using the .bat), and it did seem a little bit on the easy side, with the shamblers and vores going down rather quickly. The fiends were the enemy that gave me the most trouble.
<br /><br />The boss battle was excellently presented and I found all the little effects and details in geometry breaking or the lightning running along chains to be great.
<br /><br />I only wish I had a fraction of the talent you guys have in creating worlds like this.

I liked the Scrags and the Demon best and it´s very cool that you packed them up separately so that they can used in other Doom3 custom levels as well.
<br /><br />One thing I don´t liked was the Serious Sam style restrictive gameplay where the player is constantly locked in with gates closing behind you forever so that you are always forced straight forward. Quake was never like this, it had much more free exploration (not to mention all those secret areas and hidden passages). But that´s about the only negative point I have.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p175973" date="Posted: Sun Apr 15, 2007 8:07 pm "><author>heXum</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Fair enough.

<br /><br />I know that music is a very big part of movies &amp; games, sometimes better than words.
<br />The fact is that the song volume is to high, and too much repetitive after a time... (ok, and maybe hard rock metal is not my favourite style...)

<br /><br />It works fine for me in both Firefox and IE. Perhaps you're not giving it enough time to load? The files tend to be at least 30 megs plus so if you got on the server at a busy time (well, it's usually busy but...) or if you have a slow connection from your end...
<br />it is supposed to load the plugin automatically but I know, for instance, that IE will put that little yellow bar at the top warning you that the page is trying to load an activex control and you must allow it.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p175168" date="Posted: Thu Apr 05, 2007 12:43 am "><author>bkt</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I finally got a chance to play the mod last night.

<br /><br />yes, yes! Just wow! You guys have blown me away, honestly. Top notch and even though it was just one map, I had an absolute blast!

But I can't say I agree with the sounds or the music. Quake was a lot better there. But it's a great peice of work still.
<br /><br />Don't want to be a spoiler, but I thought it was a pity you didn't have anything after you finished the map. A picture or anything would  have been better than seeing the Doom3 splash-screen and then be dumped to the Doom3 Menu. :/ , Same thing when you die really. (Which I did once or twice. :p) Hadn't required much work to change the death GUI into being a bit more Quake.

<br />I agree. There are some other things I don't like, though.
<br /><br />- Super Shotgun only uses one shell per shot when it should be two.
<br /><br />- The spread for both of the shotguns doesn't feel right, particularly on the Super Shotgun.
<br /><br />- The look of portals needs a little work. It at least needs the effects coming from them to be the same color.
<br /><br />- The axe makes a noise when you take it out, and the surface hit noise sound is the flashlight's. It also has an animation of it being raised while the other weapons don't.
<br /><br />- You can only gib the zombies. This is just a nag, but one of the things I thought was great in the original Quake was that every single one of the non-boss monsters could be gibbed.
<br /><br />- Lightning gun should be done in a different way, it shouldn't sway when moving (at least while shooting) and the trail effect shouldn't be part of the first person gun model. Also, it shows bullet hits. I know it's not done because it's not normally in the game, but I thought I'd give a suggestion.
<br /><br />I hope that, in the future, you guys make more maps. That, and multiplayer.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p174210" date="Posted: Mon Mar 26, 2007 1:27 am "><author>kat</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">There's a problem with the ZIP file itself.

<br /><br />Also another general note for the guys... I'd strongly suggest you pack this up so that it's extracted into it's own 'mod' folder - 'Quake' - to encourage 'proper' mods and maps for it... leaving it 'open' the way it is (just dropping a PK4  into the base folder) is just asking for trouble with all sorts of conflict/overwrite errors when people try making stuff for it (which they will)
<br /><br />It's nicely done so far though, the quality is certainly there.

I really want more, I hope some people will make some more maps for this. This is some really awesome work, thank you!!!

<br /><br />I only played on Marine (I think, I launched the mod using the .bat), and it did seem a little bit on the easy side, with the shamblers and vores going down rather quickly. The fiends were the enemy that gave me the most trouble.
<br /><br />The boss battle was excellently presented and I found all the little effects and details in geometry breaking or the lightning running along chains to be great.
<br /><br />I only wish I had a fraction of the talent you guys have in creating worlds like this.

I liked the Scrags and the Demon best and it´s very cool that you packed them up separately so that they can used in other Doom3 custom levels as well.
<br /><br />One thing I don´t liked was the Serious Sam style restrictive gameplay where the player is constantly locked in with gates closing behind you forever so that you are always forced straight forward. Quake was never like this, it had much more free exploration (not to mention all those secret areas and hidden passages). But that´s about the only negative point I have.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p175973" date="Posted: Sun Apr 15, 2007 8:07 pm "><author>heXum</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Fair enough. That became necessary towards the end when I had to start forcing portals to close. It was the only way I could get a decent FPS, plus sometimes I didn't want you running away from monsters (like the boss) so I closed the door behind you.
<br /><br />Anyway, glad you liked it!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p175997" date="Posted: Sun Apr 15, 2007 11:55 pm "><author>vinnie_jones</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">hope there will be more quake maps from you guys, as someone stated above hopefully with more ambient and varied music, pref not so loud <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225054933im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p204510" date="Posted: Thu Sep 04, 2008 1:22 am "><author>Dave2600</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Ok I have no idea how to run this mod.

<br /><br />I know that music is a very big part of movies &amp; games, sometimes better than words.
<br />The fact is that the song volume is to high, and too much repetitive after a time... (ok, and maybe hard rock metal is not my favourite style...)
<br /><br />I think alternate between ambient sounds/track and a strong song for important fights is better for the "big battle for life" feeling.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p174608" date="Posted: Fri Mar 30, 2007 1:48 pm "><author>hellstorm27</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I thought the music was okay; I think there are pros and cons to having music like that in such a mod (takes out some of the suspense, but makes it feel more old-school Quake-ish).

<br /><br />It works fine for me in both Firefox and IE. Perhaps you're not giving it enough time to load? The files tend to be at least 30 megs plus so if you got on the server at a busy time (well, it's usually busy but...) or if you have a slow connection from your end...
<br />it is supposed to load the plugin automatically but I know, for instance, that IE will put that little yellow bar at the top warning you that the page is trying to load an activex control and you must allow it.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p175168" date="Posted: Thu Apr 05, 2007 12:43 am "><author>bkt</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I finally got a chance to play the mod last night.
