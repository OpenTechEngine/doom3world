To anyone who has seen the film: Were the Sunday family brothers Paul and Eli actually the same person? I just get that feeling that somehow Eli is one sick individual and that Paul might just be one of his alternate personalities. Notice how no one in his family ever even mentions his brother? I just wanted to see what anyone else thought, if there might be something there...or the conspiracy nut in me is just working wayyy too hard. thanks.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p202630" date="Posted: Sat Jul 26, 2008 11:34 am "><author>Hemebond</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">The movie lead me to believe they were different people.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p202631" date="Posted: Sat Jul 26, 2008 11:47 am "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I thought they were different.<br /><br />Bloody good movie by the way.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p202635" date="Posted: Sat Jul 26, 2008 12:47 pm "><author>lowdragon</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Hmmm, i just know "let there be chaos" - what is the german dvd title of "there will be blood" ?<br /><br />I already got "martinee" with John Goodman &amp; "nero" from the same director who made "dellamorte dellabore" on my must see list - would like to add more nice stuff.
