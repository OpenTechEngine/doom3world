I know how to make my own bones, but thats tricky.

I find myself to be quite capable with 3ds max and milkshape. I originally learnt milkshape and then movthings like rigging etc, because I have not got a clue. However, everything else I am quite competent at, but I am only 16 and hope to learn much more.&#13;<br /><br />I have downloaded the Maya 6 Personal Learning edition. Currently I think its just crap (UI-wise) compared to 3ds max, but I'm sure over time I'll understand and appreciate it more.&#13;<br /><br />Good luck and post anything you make using 3ds max, so we can offer our comments and crits. Have fun too  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p110478" date="Posted: Sun Aug 28, 2005 12:46 am "><author>Slogbog</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">in my experience the tuts that come with max are by far the best out there</div>]]></body></post><post id="p110507" date="Posted: Sun Aug 28, 2005 4:08 am "><author>pha3z</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">3ds max native docs and tutorials for newbies are better than anything else you'll find probably for learning the application.&#13;<br /><br />If you need good tutorials on basic modeling principles, search for the Joan-of-Arc tutorial.   It uses an Edge-Extrusion modeling approach.   That's a very good approach for complex organics.   I tend to prefer box modeling though.  Search google for "box modeling" tutorials in max.  Learn both approaches.  They each have their strengths.</div>]]></body></post></posts></thread></xml>
