Only the idle animations are in there for importing as we know, unlike the corpse and failed transfers for mp which have the default palms down skeleton pose.
<br /><br />I did find marine models for the single player in there.  However they all have their palms facing forward.  At first i thought i could just turn the hands, but it wasn't that simple, the arms got distorted.  The af pose would be too tricky to alter because its pretty distorted on most models.
<br /><br />I opened up the iddev's mp maya file in maya ple and seen what looked like  a palms down version of the marine.  
<br />Is there anybody that can either convert it for use in max, turn it to an md5mesh or an obj.  Even if its just the mesh without the skeleton will work fine.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p145909" date="Posted: Wed Jun 14, 2006 3:41 pm "><author>Brain Trepaning</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Export from Maya as fbX or something like that.

<br /><br />I did come up with a work around.  I was able to copy the marine's body mesh and paste it into the corpse or fail transfer meshes and it loaded up just fine in the editor in the ideal pose and exported the way I figured it would, with only the wrist being distorted.
<br /><br />I find that if I take any of the default mp models import and export them back out, I always recieve distortion around the lower arms area the most.  Any other small problems with the weights, I can get the old values from the default mesh and apply them again if needed to retune it up.  It just doesn't work for the arms.
<br /><br />I did acomplish what I wanted to in the end with a few small flaws.  Nothing too crazy though.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p145887" date="Posted: Wed Jun 14, 2006 7:59 am "><author>revility</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I'm tinkering around altering the marine mesh for q4.
