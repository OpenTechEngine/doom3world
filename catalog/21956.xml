The atom contains a lot of energy for it's size so the amount of energy required to destroy Nagasaki was actually tremendous and both of those devices were very inefficient.  But I do agree that it's always easier to destroy than create.<br /><br />The amount of energy you put into something does not equate to the amount you get out of it because we have yet to achieve a 100% efficient conversion which is the holy grail of physics with the only thing better being more than 100% of the energy extracted compared to the amount put in to extract it.  If we could we'd all be driving water powered cars that only needed a gallon of water to run for the life of the vehicle simply because of the energy stored within the atoms that make up the matter (in this case water) used to power the vehicle.<br /><br />There is also the possibility that the physics we know may not apply 100% everywhere outside of our tiny little spec of real estate in this universe so this means that the amount of energy to perform any one given task is limited in scope to our current understanding of it which by comparison is minuscule.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p204763" date="Posted: Thu Sep 11, 2008 2:55 pm "><author>BloodRayne</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Bittoman wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">It took a fraction of the energy required to blow up Nagasaki, it's not like the energy you put into something evenly comes out of it again.</div><br /><br />There is also the possibility that the physics we know may not apply 100% everywhere outside of our tiny little spec of real estate in this universe so this means that the amount of energy to perform any one given task is limited in scope to our current understanding of it which by comparison is minuscule.</div><br />Indeed, as it is highly likely that the cosmic fundamentals as we understand them are actually fluctuating.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p204764" date="Posted: Thu Sep 11, 2008 3:02 pm "><author>pbmax</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">iceheart wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">http://hasthelargehadroncolliderdestroyedtheworldyet.com/</div><br /><br />but they have not aimed 2 beams of protons at each other yet.<br /><br />so does any one have a link that explains how this could destroy the earth? i heard something about tiny balck holes...</div>]]></body></post><post id="p204766" date="Posted: Thu Sep 11, 2008 3:11 pm "><author>iceheart</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">pbmax wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">iceheart wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">http://hasthelargehadroncolliderdestroyedtheworldyet.com/</div><br /><br />but they have not aimed 2 beams of protons at each other yet.</div><br /><br />Hence the use of the word "yet" in the domain name <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081117160214im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081117160214/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_of_the_Large_Hadron_Collider#Micro_black_holes">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_of_ ... lack_holes</a><!-- m --></div>]]></body></post><post id="p204778" date="Posted: Thu Sep 11, 2008 6:39 pm "><author>Kristus</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">This explains everything you need to know: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081117160214/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lt1Yo610lG0">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lt1Yo610lG0</a><!-- m --></div>]]></body></post><post id="p204836" date="Posted: Fri Sep 12, 2008 4:37 pm "><author>KoRnScythe</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Jesus God!
