Just don't ask and tell where you got it. Screenshots were ok back then, i don't think anything has changed in this regard.</div><br /><br />Screenshots where strictly banned back then and will be this time too.<br /><br />Just talking is fine, however don't even dare to post links or to offer any form of help how to obtain the file and in return please don't ask for the file. Whatever you have, keep it to yourself, don't try to be cool because we're not cool here.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p216732" date="Posted: Mon Aug 03, 2009 6:27 pm "><author>gavavva</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Is it ok to warn people that its the biggest waste of space I've ever downloaded...? <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320002625im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> I really am shocked to see how it turned out...<br /><br />And good God they need to fire their UI designer...</div>]]></body></post><post id="p216735" date="Posted: Mon Aug 03, 2009 6:52 pm "><author>Burrito</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">BNA! wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Screenshots where strictly banned back then and will be this time too.</div><br />Oh snap...i better search next time before stating anything that sounds official:<br /><!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320002625/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?p=458#p458">viewtopic.php?p=458#p458</a><!-- l -->  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320002625im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_surprised.gif" alt=":o" title="Surprised" /><br /><br />I remember screenshots but these were all custom content back then.

This close before the release date?".  Sure it's interesting to see what the build looked like before the final one.  But to me, it feels like a moot point to take the trouble to go looking for it.  The final will be out in 2 weeks.  Can't people wait?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p216738" date="Posted: Mon Aug 03, 2009 7:53 pm "><author>=FF=Sturm</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">right now its the most smooth id tech 4... but  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320002625im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil" />  the ui is simple... very simple + the red arrows kill everything</div>]]></body></post><post id="p216741" date="Posted: Mon Aug 03, 2009 10:21 pm "><author>Zenix</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Mixed thoughts about the game so far. The UI is bad as everyone has stated. The game itself seems like a dumbed down version of Enemy Territory, which is not a good thing in my opinion. I'm not a fan of people blaming consoles for crappy PC games, but a guess would say that that is the case in this situation.<br /><br />Will still have to wait to get the proper game with some good servers up to give a real opinion.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p216745" date="Posted: Tue Aug 04, 2009 2:42 am "><author>Jack Rammsdell</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I hadn't realized the game would be out so soon.

It's the same situation when the doom 3 alpha was released.  I saw on digg.com someone posted a video of the beta with the graphics way down.  Most of the comments on there were all negative, most stated it was a horrible looking game.  It sucks because I haven't seen a lot of advertisement for the game outside of the id community so people are seeing the video of that gameplay first before they see any other media and assume the whole game will be of such sub-standard quality.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p216777" date="Posted: Wed Aug 05, 2009 2:08 am "><author>The Happy Friar</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">people here on this board were saying the games substandard quality because you could see triangles in the flamethrower &amp; rough edges on some arms.

Sadly the game seems like it is going to flop, nothing new, yet another old time shooter.  Is this game even going to be sold in germany? I know the original was banned.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p216786" date="Posted: Wed Aug 05, 2009 7:42 am "><author>Zenix</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">It's a big fail on Activision's part, that the first ever multiplayer gameplay videos released are from a a leaked beta with the graphics turned right down.<br /><br />It'd be hard to imagine a marketing campaign worse than Activisions. Personally I'm very glad that id dumped them, and hope EA can do a better job on Rage.</div>]]></body></post></posts></thread></xml>
