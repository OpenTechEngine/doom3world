It would be short sections (eposidioc like) based around the Doom 3 universe.  The reason I like this is that stary 1 could be based around you being one of the guys from Bravo company that gets slaughtered, another could be you're "Bob the Imp" (from planetdoom's comic) &amp; go on an adventure as him, one could be you walk through a teleporter &amp; end up in an "alternate universe" where the demons made teleporters &amp; marines are invading hell (as the bad guys).   Along the same lines would be an idea like the "Simpsons Spinoff Showcase" where the storys aren't all in the D3 universe.  <br /><br />Imagination is the limit.  Lots of D3 assets will be used so we won't depend on all new weapon models, code, assets, levels, etc.  We can do more creative stuff though, like make new weapons, a new baddie or two, put in more puzzle's (i really liked this about Prey).  <br /><br />Also, modders will be able to work on parts they like.  Me, for example, doesn't really want to do a super-serious mod, so me &amp; a couple other modders could work on a short story that gets kinda silly.<br /><br />A HUGE advantage I see to this type of mod is the attention span of the modders.  We won't be spending months to years on one single idea.  I feel with more variety we'll have less modders who start just disapear for no reason.<br /><br />The biggest problem I see is the coding.  If I want a weapon system that uses duel-weapons seperetly (ala "RTH") &amp; someone else wants all alt-fire, that could be a problem (i'm not a great coder so, as far as I'm concerned, if i can't figure it out i'm not doing the right thing!).

So the idea is a 3rd person survival horror mod that is based in modern time in a small town. The concept is when the power goes out the demons come. every 10 mins the town will blackout and you must try to keep a generator running to decrease the amount of time that the power is out for a better chance of survival. so you must find items such as a flashlight, weapons, fuel, food, batteries ect.. to survive the blackouts.<br /><br />There would be no need to create a whole town, just a house with a backyard and a wooden fence to keep you in.<br /><br />If thirdperson isn't possible, then it would be just as fun in firstperson, because then you would have a chance to have a more interactive enviroment and allow the player to open cabinets and drawers and all sorts of stuff to search for much needed items. </div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">mikebart wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I’ll contribute where I can but I couldn’t commit full time, I’m way too unreliable at the moment, I’ve got a few ideas for the project though, just a simple brief really im sure a few things have been said before.<br /><br />3-5 small single player showcase maps: displaying advanced modelling, texturing, lighting, physics, coding etc, each with its own theme e.g. horror, sci-fi, fantasy, modern day, stroggos.<br />In addition to each of the showcase maps we have multi player maps which follow the same theme as their single player parent but geared more towards performance rather than graphics and effects.<br />Assets from ‘both’ could be used for other ideas such as short stories and which in turn could provide assets for the single and multi player maps.<br /><br />All the textures and models used in the single player showcase maps could be rendered/projected out to simpler assets to be used in the lower poly multiplayer maps.

Doom 3 seems to be extremely well suited to a dark, greasy industrial era (lighting-wise).  Would be a good setting if the adventure were set in an all night raid and would minimize the number of NPC models necessary for the mod (a little less work), mostly just needing to re-skin current player models to fit them with more modern uniforms or prison outfits.

By small I don't necessarily mean content but in the actual mod size.  Even more specifically the number of maps being kept to a small numbers (maybe a half dozen or less).  This would be for a "first installment".  My reasons is one of the hardest things to keep a mod group going is the interest in it, if the project can have a near and clear ending then confidence of what the team is capable of will be significantly boosted, when the project is completed confidence gets an even bigger boost.  Using that inertia the project could be expanded.  Maybe even an episodic type of adventure like the Half Life 2 episodes (on a much smaller scale).
<br /><br />Other than this I think it's also important to nail down what kind of mod would be in mind.  Should this be a multiplayer mod or a singleplayer mod?  Keeping in mind what I said above, choosing one or the other would be smart and not trying to combine the two saving that for the "next installment" maybe.  Personally I'd be interested in seeing a single player game that featured some new objects (weapons, tools, etc.) that pushes the player to be more interactive with their world as opposed to the usual "if it moves, shoot it".  This might put a bit of emphasis on the programmer or whoever's handling level scripts though.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p171486" date="Posted: Sun Feb 25, 2007 2:32 am "><author>voldemort</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Well I would just like to say this I do mapping but layout is my downfall once blocked out and rough detailed --I like to go insane on detail items --so long as they dont affect fram rate that is Just figured I would share that since its my only real strength --preaty lame I know <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p171492" date="Posted: Sun Feb 25, 2007 3:44 am "><author>nbrancaccio</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Hey I like this idea! As you stated, it is a perfect solution for mod makers with all types of attention spans haha! Plus, it would be great for someone like myself, who is definatly interested in creating all sorts of assets, models, textures, maps you name it, but don't quite have the dedication for a full time mod, but at the same time, dont want my stuff going unused. This could really be a lot of fun.
<br /><br />I also liked your idea on having a sense of humor about it. I think mods these days are far too serious and try to be too professional, when they are truely missing the whole advantage of being modders: there is no distributor telling you what to do! You can be as edgy, wild, and crazy as you like <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />I could provide vurtually anything visual: Models, textures, texture sets, custom skyboxes... this could be fun!
<br /><br />Episodic is also key: simply releasing anything puts you a step above most other mod makers as most do not get released. Episodic releases would expedite this release.
<br /><br />nice!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p171500" date="Posted: Sun Feb 25, 2007 6:14 am "><author>Jack Rammsdell</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I have several ideas, but I am not going to share them all at once.

<br />would be cool to do a "what if" kinda story,
<br />lets say the nazzis won ww2 (not totally illogical
<br />IF the nazi leadership under Hitler had removed him from
<br />power just before that idiotic twofront idea he had
<br />about invading Soviet in 1941) and then move the timeline forward
<br />to about 2030 or similar, Mars is still Mars etc but instead of Betruger
<br />call the scientist something like Himmler the fourth,
<br />Reinhard Heydrich the third or similar, you get the drift,
<br />and then fill Mars with nazi swastika, do a couple of new
<br />levels thats kinda were unreachable in vanilla doom
<br />(theres doors that cannot be opened in vanilla d3,
<br />those new maps could be reached by those doors),
<br />all this could be a lot like RTCW i guess, but i fail to see how
<br />THAT cannot be anything but good since RTCW pwned  ; )
<br />Imagine running around in doom 3 with a MP44,
<br />MG42, stiefelhandgranaten and a flammenverfer  hehehe

<br />that And the default walk pace is to slow for action but perfect for a terror level where you expect stuff to pop out
<br /><br />So depending on what we want
<br />If we want action
<br />Definalty need to pick up the pace
<br />if we decide on horor it can go either way
<br /><br />If we do the pop out of the walls trick like ID  then slow for sure
<br />But if we use enviroment and audio to do the trick we can pick up the pace and still instill terror
<br /><br />One of the things That was missing between this doom and the first and second was  a fast pace of action --but this one definatly creates more an atmosphere
<br /><br />I agree on the doom3 engine to much was stripped from the q4 engine in my opinion  it just dosnt look as good --maybe thats just me but I still think the original d3 looks the best</div>]]></body></post><post id="p171575" date="Posted: Mon Feb 26, 2007 3:40 am "><author>Jack Rammsdell</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">In my opinion, action is the only way to go, to get everyones interest, I didn't like doom 3 in some parts because it was slow and you could always expect somone to pop out of left field.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p171580" date="Posted: Mon Feb 26, 2007 4:43 am "><author>The Happy Friar</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">i didn't intend for this thread to critique ideas, just to post them (and perhaps more clarifying questions).
<br /><br />While I agree about the "Action is needed" stance, look at HL2.  The action there was filler between mono logs.  Yet that game still sold (honestly, i STILL don't know why).
<br /><br />re: jack's "non-violent" idea...
<br /><br />that idea DOES sound interesting (myst-like, i've had the same idea along with pbmax), the only issue I see is that the only people who would play are people who already owned D3, which is violent.  Do you think people would re-install D3 for that, or perhaps, BUY a copy of D3 for that?  (obviously if it's good enough).  That would be a killer idea for a full-fledged game though.
<br /><br />Me &amp; PBMax threw around a few ideas months ago.  One I had was a game where space-sheep are invading earth &amp; space-goats are defending it.  Pretty much you can imagine how that winds up just from the sheep &amp; goat motif.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />  Lots of cloven-betrayal in there!
<br /><br />But that's what I like about the modular/eposidic/short story based mod idea.  The whistle can be wet in different types of ideas.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p171595" date="Posted: Mon Feb 26, 2007 1:31 pm "><author>Jack Rammsdell</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">What about a Deathmatch mod with gothic, industrial, and technology based enviroments that brought in the feel of quake 3 and the looks of quake 4.

My reasons is one of the hardest things to keep a mod group going is the interest in it, if the project can have a near and clear ending then confidence of what the team is capable of will be significantly boosted, when the project is completed confidence gets an even bigger boost.  Using that inertia the project could be expanded.  Maybe even an episodic type of adventure like the Half Life 2 episodes (on a much smaller scale).
<br /><br />Other than this I think it's also important to nail down what kind of mod would be in mind.  Should this be a multiplayer mod or a singleplayer mod?  Keeping in mind what I said above, choosing one or the other would be smart and not trying to combine the two saving that for the "next installment" maybe.  Personally I'd be interested in seeing a single player game that featured some new objects (weapons, tools, etc.) that pushes the player to be more interactive with their world as opposed to the usual "if it moves, shoot it".  This might put a bit of emphasis on the programmer or whoever's handling level scripts though.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p171486" date="Posted: Sun Feb 25, 2007 2:32 am "><author>voldemort</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Well I would just like to say this I do mapping but layout is my downfall once blocked out and rough detailed --I like to go insane on detail items --so long as they dont affect fram rate that is Just figured I would share that since its my only real strength --preaty lame I know <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081204065225im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p171492" date="Posted: Sun Feb 25, 2007 3:44 am "><author>nbrancaccio</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Hey I like this idea!

<br /><br />While I agree about the "Action is needed" stance, look at HL2.  The action there was filler between mono logs.  Yet that game still sold (honestly, i STILL don't know why).
<br /><br />re: jack's "non-violent" idea...
<br /><br />that idea DOES sound interesting (myst-like, i've had the same idea along with pbmax), the only issue I see is that the only people who would play are people who already owned D3, which is violent.  Do you think people would re-install D3 for that, or perhaps, BUY a copy of D3 for that?  (obviously if it's good enough).  That would be a killer idea for a full-fledged game though.
<br /><br />Me &amp; PBMax threw around a few ideas months ago.  One I had was a game where space-sheep are invading earth &amp; space-goats are defending it.  Pretty much you can imagine how that winds up just from the sheep &amp; goat motif.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081204065225im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />  Lots of cloven-betrayal in there!

<br /><br />If you're referring to my short story idea &amp; that's what you took it at I need to explain better:  It's not a MEGA-mod, it's a mod that doesn't have one central theme, it's one short story after another.  Not necessarily all done at once.  So I didn't intend to promote an "all-inclusive" mod, but more a a collection of story's, like a collection of Sci-Fi story's.  I guess the closest relation to my idea would be Doom 1, Q1 or AvP where each "episode" is different but tied together with the same main characters.

People throw out your ideas (don't forget that, odds are, amatures will be working on this to so don't except "RTH" or "Dark Mod" quality.  Just HOPE it!).  iI'm imagining something closer to "Duck Nukem" quality (being realistic here!)  iThen we'll vote.
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">IDEAS: </span></span>
<br /><div class="quotetitle">The Happy Friar off original idea by Dinky wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Do a Doom 3 mod simular to the idea behind the Simpsons episode "22 short films about springfield."  It would be short sections (eposidioc like) based around the Doom 3 universe.  The reason I like this is that stary 1 could be based around you being one of the guys from Bravo company that gets slaughtered, another could be you're "Bob the Imp" (from planetdoom's comic) &amp; go on an adventure as him, one could be you walk through a teleporter &amp; end up in an "alternate universe" where the demons made teleporters &amp; marines are invading hell (as the bad guys).   Along the same lines would be an idea like the "Simpsons Spinoff Showcase" where the storys aren't all in the D3 universe.  <br /><br />Imagination is the limit.  Lots of D3 assets will be used so we won't depend on all new weapon models, code, assets, levels, etc.  We can do more creative stuff though, like make new weapons, a new baddie or two, put in more puzzle's (i really liked this about Prey).  <br /><br />Also, modders will be able to work on parts they like.  Me, for example, doesn't really want to do a super-serious mod, so me &amp; a couple other modders could work on a short story that gets kinda silly.<br /><br />A HUGE advantage I see to this type of mod is the attention span of the modders.  We won't be spending months to years on one single idea.  I feel with more variety we'll have less modders who start just disapear for no reason.<br /><br />The biggest problem I see is the coding.  If I want a weapon system that uses duel-weapons seperetly (ala "RTH") &amp; someone else wants all alt-fire, that could be a problem (i'm not a great coder so, as far as I'm concerned, if i can't figure it out i'm not doing the right thing!).  Problems along that line.</div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Jack Rammsdell wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I have several ideas, but I am not going to share them all at once.

So the idea is a 3rd person survival horror mod that is based in modern time in a small town. The concept is when the power goes out the demons come. every 10 mins the town will blackout and you must try to keep a generator running to decrease the amount of time that the power is out for a better chance of survival. so you must find items such as a flashlight, weapons, fuel, food, batteries ect.. to survive the blackouts.<br /><br />There would be no need to create a whole town, just a house with a backyard and a wooden fence to keep you in.<br /><br />If thirdperson isn't possible, then it would be just as fun in firstperson, because then you would have a chance to have a more interactive enviroment and allow the player to open cabinets and drawers and all sorts of stuff to search for much needed items. </div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">mikebart wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I’ll contribute where I can but I couldn’t commit full time, I’m way too unreliable at the moment, I’ve got a few ideas for the project though, just a simple brief really im sure a few things have been said before.<br /><br />3-5 small single player showcase maps: displaying advanced modelling, texturing, lighting, physics, coding etc, each with its own theme e.g. horror, sci-fi, fantasy, modern day, stroggos.<br />In addition to each of the showcase maps we have multi player maps which follow the same theme as their single player parent but geared more towards performance rather than graphics and effects.<br />Assets from ‘both’ could be used for other ideas such as short stories and which in turn could provide assets for the single and multi player maps.<br /><br />All the textures and models used in the single player showcase maps could be rendered/projected out to simpler assets to be used in the lower poly multiplayer maps.

People throw out your ideas (don't forget that, odds are, amatures will be working on this to so don't except "RTH" or "Dark Mod" quality.  Just HOPE it!).  iI'm imagining something closer to "Duck Nukem" quality (being realistic here!)  iThen we'll vote.

<br /><div class="quotetitle">The Happy Friar off original idea by Dinky wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Do a Doom 3 mod simular to the idea behind the Simpsons episode "22 short films about springfield."  It would be short sections (eposidioc like) based around the Doom 3 universe.  The reason I like this is that stary 1 could be based around you being one of the guys from Bravo company that gets slaughtered, another could be you're "Bob the Imp" (from planetdoom's comic) &amp; go on an adventure as him, one could be you walk through a teleporter &amp; end up in an "alternate universe" where the demons made teleporters &amp; marines are invading hell (as the bad guys).   Along the same lines would be an idea like the "Simpsons Spinoff Showcase" where the storys aren't all in the D3 universe.  <br /><br />Imagination is the limit.  Lots of D3 assets will be used so we won't depend on all new weapon models, code, assets, levels, etc.  We can do more creative stuff though, like make new weapons, a new baddie or two, put in more puzzle's (i really liked this about Prey).  <br /><br />Also, modders will be able to work on parts they like.  Me, for example, doesn't really want to do a super-serious mod, so me &amp; a couple other modders could work on a short story that gets kinda silly.<br /><br />A HUGE advantage I see to this type of mod is the attention span of the modders.  We won't be spending months to years on one single idea.  I feel with more variety we'll have less modders who start just disapear for no reason.<br /><br />The biggest problem I see is the coding.  If I want a weapon system that uses duel-weapons seperetly (ala "RTH") &amp; someone else wants all alt-fire, that could be a problem (i'm not a great coder so, as far as I'm concerned, if i can't figure it out i'm not doing the right thing!).  Problems along that line.</div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Jack Rammsdell wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I have several ideas, but I am not going to share them all at once.

I know it may seem boring to some people who live off violence, but it would be something that would be accepted by a large community and could be enjoyed by a larger group of people.  It would be a good opportunity to mix both real world and fantasy settings.

So the idea is a 3rd person survival horror mod that is based in modern time in a small town. The concept is when the power goes out the demons come. every 10 mins the town will blackout and you must try to keep a generator running to decrease the amount of time that the power is out for a better chance of survival. so you must find items such as a flashlight, weapons, fuel, food, batteries ect.. to survive the blackouts.<br /><br />There would be no need to create a whole town, just a house with a backyard and a wooden fence to keep you in.<br /><br />If thirdperson isn't possible, then it would be just as fun in firstperson, because then you would have a chance to have a more interactive enviroment and allow the player to open cabinets and drawers and all sorts of stuff to search for much needed items. </div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">mikebart wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I’ll contribute where I can but I couldn’t commit full time, I’m way too unreliable at the moment, I’ve got a few ideas for the project though, just a simple brief really im sure a few things have been said before.<br /><br />3-5 small single player showcase maps: displaying advanced modelling, texturing, lighting, physics, coding etc, each with its own theme e.g. horror, sci-fi, fantasy, modern day, stroggos.<br />In addition to each of the showcase maps we have multi player maps which follow the same theme as their single player parent but geared more towards performance rather than graphics and effects.<br />Assets from ‘both’ could be used for other ideas such as short stories and which in turn could provide assets for the single and multi player maps.<br /><br />All the textures and models used in the single player showcase maps could be rendered/projected out to simpler assets to be used in the lower poly multiplayer maps. But this doesn’t mean the multiplayer maps can’t exist until the single player maps have been started they can both be worked on in tandem providing assets for each other.</div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">6th Venom wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Do you remember about "Code Quantum" (Quantum Leap) tv serie?<br /><br />In this tv serie, a man travel in the time and become another person (the one he must help or save) the time of an episode, when he change this person destiny, don't know how or why, he is projected in the time one more time, etc...<br /><br />To keep maps linked, could make a similar thing, allowing different physical heroes, different places and times, but with a strong storyline in the back of each adventures.</div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bittoman wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">A time traveling platoon of Strogg comes to early industrial Earth.  Invading a military base they manage to blow a whole in the side of the brigg.  You are a military prisoner who escapes and ends up fending for himself while trying to battle the Strogg.  Cutting to the end you defeat the Strogg and earn a hero's medal.<br /><br />Kind of a Wolfenstein 3D with different characters.  Doom 3 seems to be extremely well suited to a dark, greasy industrial era (lighting-wise).  Would be a good setting if the adventure were set in an all night raid and would minimize the number of NPC models necessary for the mod (a little less work), mostly just needing to re-skin current player models to fit them with more modern uniforms or prison outfits.  I can see this done with a little Duke Nukem style humor too.</div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bittoman wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">It could be something done as an extension to the Doom 3 game so how about a role reversal where you're an Imp battling invading Marines?</div></div>]]></body></post><post id="p171485" date="Posted: Sun Feb 25, 2007 3:26 am "><author>Bittoman</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I think it would be smart to start small.  By small I don't necessarily mean content but in the actual mod size.  Even more specifically the number of maps being kept to a small numbers (maybe a half dozen or less).  This would be for a "first installment".  My reasons is one of the hardest things to keep a mod group going is the interest in it, if the project can have a near and clear ending then confidence of what the team is capable of will be significantly boosted, when the project is completed confidence gets an even bigger boost.  Using that inertia the project could be expanded.  Maybe even an episodic type of adventure like the Half Life 2 episodes (on a much smaller scale).
<br /><br />Other than this I think it's also important to nail down what kind of mod would be in mind.  Should this be a multiplayer mod or a singleplayer mod?  Keeping in mind what I said above, choosing one or the other would be smart and not trying to combine the two saving that for the "next installment" maybe.  Personally I'd be interested in seeing a single player game that featured some new objects (weapons, tools, etc.) that pushes the player to be more interactive with their world as opposed to the usual "if it moves, shoot it".  This might put a bit of emphasis on the programmer or whoever's handling level scripts though.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p171486" date="Posted: Sun Feb 25, 2007 3:32 am "><author>voldemort</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Well I would just like to say this I do mapping but layout is my downfall once blocked out and rough detailed --I like to go insane on detail items --so long as they dont affect fram rate that is Just figured I would share that since its my only real strength --preaty lame I know <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225095754im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p171492" date="Posted: Sun Feb 25, 2007 4:44 am "><author>nbrancaccio</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Hey I like this idea! As you stated, it is a perfect solution for mod makers with all types of attention spans haha! Plus, it would be great for someone like myself, who is definatly interested in creating all sorts of assets, models, textures, maps you name it, but don't quite have the dedication for a full time mod, but at the same time, dont want my stuff going unused. This could really be a lot of fun.
<br /><br />I also liked your idea on having a sense of humor about it. I think mods these days are far too serious and try to be too professional, when they are truely missing the whole advantage of being modders: there is no distributor telling you what to do! You can be as edgy, wild, and crazy as you like <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225095754im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />I could provide vurtually anything visual: Models, textures, texture sets, custom skyboxes... this could be fun!
<br /><br />Episodic is also key: simply releasing anything puts you a step above most other mod makers as most do not get released. Episodic releases would expedite this release.

Depending on the detail, some storys would make good individual mods, some could be short mods that would fit in the multi-story idea.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Regulator wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Yeah I've seen megamod discussion on the other site and it failed.</div>
<br /><br />If you're referring to my short story idea &amp; that's what you took it at I need to explain better:  It's not a MEGA-mod, it's a mod that doesn't have one central theme, it's one short story after another.  Not necessarily all done at once.  So I didn't intend to promote an "all-inclusive" mod, but more a a collection of story's, like a collection of Sci-Fi story's.  I guess the closest relation to my idea would be Doom 1, Q1 or AvP where each "episode" is different but tied together with the same main characters.

Then each charcter is brought before the vadrigar themselves and thrown into an arena to fight, so now we are mixing the short stories, deathmatch and quake 3 <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225095502im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />p.s. that was idea #3
<br /><br />Now number 4
<br /><br />last saturday our town was hit with a heavy sleet that knocked the power off for a few hours.  which gave me an idea for a small survival horror scenario.  
<br /><br />I've always wanted to do 3rd person because it was so differnt from the standard FPS games we all play.  So the idea is a 3rd person survival horror mod that is based in modern time in a small town.  The concept is when the power goes out the demons come.  every 10 mins the town will blackout and you must try to keep a generator running to decrease the amount of time that the power is out for a better chance of survival.  so you must find items such as a flashlight, weapons, fuel, food, batteries ect.. to survive the blackouts.  
<br /><br />There would be no need to create a whole town, just a house with a backyard and a wooden fence to keep you in. 
<br /><br />If thirdperson isn't possible, then it would be just as fun in firstperson, because then you would have a chance to have a more interactive enviroment and allow the player to open cabinets and drawers and all sorts of stuff to search for much needed items.
<br /><br />I have yet 3 other ideas but these were meant to be projects I would work on after my "alone" project.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p171666" date="Posted: Tue Feb 27, 2007 6:20 am "><author>mikebart</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I’ll contribute where I can but I couldn’t commit full time, I’m way too unreliable at the moment, I’ve got a few ideas for the project though, just a simple brief really im sure a few things have been said before.
<br /><br />3-5 small single player showcase maps: displaying advanced modelling, texturing, lighting, physics, coding etc, each with its own theme e.g. horror, sci-fi, fantasy, modern day, stroggos.
<br />In addition to each of the showcase maps we have multi player maps which follow the same theme as their single player parent but geared more towards performance rather than graphics and effects.
<br />Assets from ‘both’ could be used for other ideas such as short stories and which in turn could provide assets for the single and multi player maps.
<br /><br />All the textures and models used in the single player showcase maps could be rendered/projected out to simpler assets to be used in the lower poly multiplayer maps. But this doesn’t mean the multiplayer maps can’t exist until the single player maps have been started they can both be worked on in tandem providing assets for each other.
<br /><br />There’s my 2 cents, it was probably more bias towards modelling and texturing because that’s what im into, but the main idea im trying to get across is to try and create a productive flow which exchanges between all projects.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p171668" date="Posted: Tue Feb 27, 2007 6:24 am "><author>The Happy Friar</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">updated the first post.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225095502im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Ya know Jack... your last idea sounds like "house.map" in my mod, except I didn't bother to make it so you gotta keep the generator going (thought about it but couldn't think of a reason to as you didn't need to be in the house).</div>]]></body></post><post id="p171679" date="Posted: Tue Feb 27, 2007 9:26 am "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">No Nazi stuff please, thanks.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p171689" date="Posted: Tue Feb 27, 2007 2:03 pm "><author>Jack Rammsdell</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">The Happy Friar wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">updated the first post.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225095502im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Ya know Jack... your last idea sounds like "house.map" in my mod, except I didn't bother to make it so you gotta keep the generator going (thought about it but couldn't think of a reason to as you didn't need to be in the house).</div>

<br /><br />This intriuges me.... we could make the inhabitants of the town trying to get to some kind of shelter intended to save people from disaster and you play the story of how each person fights their way to get there....
<br />You could have a disaster like in The Day After Tommorow but with monsters and puzzles and it also fits in perfectly with the short stories idea.

So the idea is a 3rd person survival horror mod that is based in modern time in a small town. The concept is when the power goes out the demons come. every 10 mins the town will blackout and you must try to keep a generator running to decrease the amount of time that the power is out for a better chance of survival. so you must find items such as a flashlight, weapons, fuel, food, batteries ect.. to survive the blackouts.<br /><br />There would be no need to create a whole town, just a house with a backyard and a wooden fence to keep you in.<br /><br />If thirdperson isn't possible, then it would be just as fun in firstperson, because then you would have a chance to have a more interactive enviroment and allow the player to open cabinets and drawers and all sorts of stuff to search for much needed items. </div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">mikebart wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I’ll contribute where I can but I couldn’t commit full time, I’m way too unreliable at the moment, I’ve got a few ideas for the project though, just a simple brief really im sure a few things have been said before.<br /><br />3-5 small single player showcase maps: displaying advanced modelling, texturing, lighting, physics, coding etc, each with its own theme e.g. horror, sci-fi, fantasy, modern day, stroggos.<br />In addition to each of the showcase maps we have multi player maps which follow the same theme as their single player parent but geared more towards performance rather than graphics and effects.<br />Assets from ‘both’ could be used for other ideas such as short stories and which in turn could provide assets for the single and multi player maps.<br /><br />All the textures and models used in the single player showcase maps could be rendered/projected out to simpler assets to be used in the lower poly multiplayer maps. But this doesn’t mean the multiplayer maps can’t exist until the single player maps have been started they can both be worked on in tandem providing assets for each other.</div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">6th Venom wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Do you remember about "Code Quantum" (Quantum Leap) tv serie?<br /><br />In this tv serie, a man travel in the time and become another person (the one he must help or save) the time of an episode, when he change this person destiny, don't know how or why, he is projected in the time one more time, etc...<br /><br />To keep maps linked, could make a similar thing, allowing different physical heroes, different places and times, but with a strong storyline in the back of each adventures.</div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bittoman wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">A time traveling platoon of Strogg comes to early industrial Earth.

Cutting to the end you defeat the Strogg and earn a hero's medal.<br /><br />Kind of a Wolfenstein 3D with different characters.  Doom 3 seems to be extremely well suited to a dark, greasy industrial era (lighting-wise).  Would be a good setting if the adventure were set in an all night raid and would minimize the number of NPC models necessary for the mod (a little less work), mostly just needing to re-skin current player models to fit them with more modern uniforms or prison outfits.  I can see this done with a little Duke Nukem style humor too.</div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bittoman wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">It could be something done as an extension to the Doom 3 game so how about a role reversal where you're an Imp battling invading Marines?</div></div>]]></body></post><post id="p171485" date="Posted: Sun Feb 25, 2007 2:26 am "><author>Bittoman</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I think it would be smart to start small.  By small I don't necessarily mean content but in the actual mod size.  Even more specifically the number of maps being kept to a small numbers (maybe a half dozen or less).  This would be for a "first installment".  My reasons is one of the hardest things to keep a mod group going is the interest in it, if the project can have a near and clear ending then confidence of what the team is capable of will be significantly boosted, when the project is completed confidence gets an even bigger boost.  Using that inertia the project could be expanded.  Maybe even an episodic type of adventure like the Half Life 2 episodes (on a much smaller scale).
<br /><br />Other than this I think it's also important to nail down what kind of mod would be in mind.  Should this be a multiplayer mod or a singleplayer mod?  Keeping in mind what I said above, choosing one or the other would be smart and not trying to combine the two saving that for the "next installment" maybe.  Personally I'd be interested in seeing a single player game that featured some new objects (weapons, tools, etc.) that pushes the player to be more interactive with their world as opposed to the usual "if it moves, shoot it".  This might put a bit of emphasis on the programmer or whoever's handling level scripts though.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p171486" date="Posted: Sun Feb 25, 2007 2:32 am "><author>voldemort</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Well I would just like to say this I do mapping but layout is my downfall once blocked out and rough detailed --I like to go insane on detail items --so long as they dont affect fram rate that is Just figured I would share that since its my only real strength --preaty lame I know <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p171492" date="Posted: Sun Feb 25, 2007 3:44 am "><author>nbrancaccio</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Hey I like this idea! As you stated, it is a perfect solution for mod makers with all types of attention spans haha! Plus, it would be great for someone like myself, who is definatly interested in creating all sorts of assets, models, textures, maps you name it, but don't quite have the dedication for a full time mod, but at the same time, dont want my stuff going unused. This could really be a lot of fun.
<br /><br />I also liked your idea on having a sense of humor about it. I think mods these days are far too serious and try to be too professional, when they are truely missing the whole advantage of being modders: there is no distributor telling you what to do! You can be as edgy, wild, and crazy as you like <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />I could provide vurtually anything visual: Models, textures, texture sets, custom skyboxes... this could be fun!
<br /><br />Episodic is also key: simply releasing anything puts you a step above most other mod makers as most do not get released. Episodic releases would expedite this release.
<br /><br />nice!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p171500" date="Posted: Sun Feb 25, 2007 6:14 am "><author>Jack Rammsdell</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I have several ideas, but I am not going to share them all at once.

<br />would be cool to do a "what if" kinda story,
<br />lets say the nazzis won ww2 (not totally illogical
<br />IF the nazi leadership under Hitler had removed him from
<br />power just before that idiotic twofront idea he had
<br />about invading Soviet in 1941) and then move the timeline forward
<br />to about 2030 or similar, Mars is still Mars etc but instead of Betruger
<br />call the scientist something like Himmler the fourth,
<br />Reinhard Heydrich the third or similar, you get the drift,
<br />and then fill Mars with nazi swastika, do a couple of new
<br />levels thats kinda were unreachable in vanilla doom
<br />(theres doors that cannot be opened in vanilla d3,
<br />those new maps could be reached by those doors),
<br />all this could be a lot like RTCW i guess, but i fail to see how
<br />THAT cannot be anything but good since RTCW pwned  ; )
<br />Imagine running around in doom 3 with a MP44,
<br />MG42, stiefelhandgranaten and a flammenverfer  hehehe

<br />If we want action
<br />Definalty need to pick up the pace
<br />if we decide on horor it can go either way
<br /><br />If we do the pop out of the walls trick like ID  then slow for sure
<br />But if we use enviroment and audio to do the trick we can pick up the pace and still instill terror
<br /><br />One of the things That was missing between this doom and the first and second was  a fast pace of action --but this one definatly creates more an atmosphere

<br /><br />While I agree about the "Action is needed" stance, look at HL2.  The action there was filler between mono logs.  Yet that game still sold (honestly, i STILL don't know why).
<br /><br />re: jack's "non-violent" idea...
<br /><br />that idea DOES sound interesting (myst-like, i've had the same idea along with pbmax), the only issue I see is that the only people who would play are people who already owned D3, which is violent.  Do you think people would re-install D3 for that, or perhaps, BUY a copy of D3 for that?  (obviously if it's good enough).  That would be a killer idea for a full-fledged game though.
<br /><br />Me &amp; PBMax threw around a few ideas months ago.  One I had was a game where space-sheep are invading earth &amp; space-goats are defending it.  Pretty much you can imagine how that winds up just from the sheep &amp; goat motif.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />  Lots of cloven-betrayal in there!

By small I don't necessarily mean content but in the actual mod size.  Even more specifically the number of maps being kept to a small numbers (maybe a half dozen or less).  This would be for a "first installment".  My reasons is one of the hardest things to keep a mod group going is the interest in it, if the project can have a near and clear ending then confidence of what the team is capable of will be significantly boosted, when the project is completed confidence gets an even bigger boost.  Using that inertia the project could be expanded.  Maybe even an episodic type of adventure like the Half Life 2 episodes (on a much smaller scale).
<br /><br />Other than this I think it's also important to nail down what kind of mod would be in mind.  Should this be a multiplayer mod or a singleplayer mod?  Keeping in mind what I said above, choosing one or the other would be smart and not trying to combine the two saving that for the "next installment" maybe.  Personally I'd be interested in seeing a single player game that featured some new objects (weapons, tools, etc.) that pushes the player to be more interactive with their world as opposed to the usual "if it moves, shoot it".  This might put a bit of emphasis on the programmer or whoever's handling level scripts though.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p171486" date="Posted: Sun Feb 25, 2007 3:32 am "><author>voldemort</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Well I would just like to say this I do mapping but layout is my downfall once blocked out and rough detailed --I like to go insane on detail items --so long as they dont affect fram rate that is Just figured I would share that since its my only real strength --preaty lame I know <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225095754im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p171492" date="Posted: Sun Feb 25, 2007 4:44 am "><author>nbrancaccio</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Hey I like this idea! As you stated, it is a perfect solution for mod makers with all types of attention spans haha! Plus, it would be great for someone like myself, who is definatly interested in creating all sorts of assets, models, textures, maps you name it, but don't quite have the dedication for a full time mod, but at the same time, dont want my stuff going unused. This could really be a lot of fun.
<br /><br />I also liked your idea on having a sense of humor about it. I think mods these days are far too serious and try to be too professional, when they are truely missing the whole advantage of being modders: there is no distributor telling you what to do! You can be as edgy, wild, and crazy as you like <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225095754im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />I could provide vurtually anything visual: Models, textures, texture sets, custom skyboxes... this could be fun!
<br /><br />Episodic is also key: simply releasing anything puts you a step above most other mod makers as most do not get released. Episodic releases would expedite this release.

How about doing something that almost every doom 3 mod isn't, why not make a completly non-violent mod where the player is on a quest to find his way home and encounters a variety of puzzles and task sequences.  I know it may seem boring to some people who live off violence, but it would be something that would be accepted by a large community and could be enjoyed by a larger group of people.  It would be a good opportunity to mix both real world and fantasy settings.  With settings such as a haunted castle or other strange enviroments that could be seen in a sort of riven or myst game.

<br />would be cool to do a "what if" kinda story,
<br />lets say the nazzis won ww2 (not totally illogical
<br />IF the nazi leadership under Hitler had removed him from
<br />power just before that idiotic twofront idea he had
<br />about invading Soviet in 1941) and then move the timeline forward
<br />to about 2030 or similar, Mars is still Mars etc but instead of Betruger
<br />call the scientist something like Himmler the fourth,
<br />Reinhard Heydrich the third or similar, you get the drift,
<br />and then fill Mars with nazi swastika, do a couple of new
<br />levels thats kinda were unreachable in vanilla doom
<br />(theres doors that cannot be opened in vanilla d3,
<br />those new maps could be reached by those doors),
<br />all this could be a lot like RTCW i guess, but i fail to see how
<br />THAT cannot be anything but good since RTCW pwned  ; )
<br />Imagine running around in doom 3 with a MP44,
<br />MG42, stiefelhandgranaten and a flammenverfer  hehehe

<br /><br />While I agree about the "Action is needed" stance, look at HL2.  The action there was filler between mono logs.  Yet that game still sold (honestly, i STILL don't know why).
<br /><br />re: jack's "non-violent" idea...
<br /><br />that idea DOES sound interesting (myst-like, i've had the same idea along with pbmax), the only issue I see is that the only people who would play are people who already owned D3, which is violent.  Do you think people would re-install D3 for that, or perhaps, BUY a copy of D3 for that?  (obviously if it's good enough).  That would be a killer idea for a full-fledged game though.
<br /><br />Me &amp; PBMax threw around a few ideas months ago.  One I had was a game where space-sheep are invading earth &amp; space-goats are defending it.  Pretty much you can imagine how that winds up just from the sheep &amp; goat motif.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225095754im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />  Lots of cloven-betrayal in there!

<br /><br />If you're referring to my short story idea &amp; that's what you took it at I need to explain better:  It's not a MEGA-mod, it's a mod that doesn't have one central theme, it's one short story after another.  Not necessarily all done at once.  So I didn't intend to promote an "all-inclusive" mod, but more a a collection of story's, like a collection of Sci-Fi story's.  I guess the closest relation to my idea would be Doom 1, Q1 or AvP where each "episode" is different but tied together with the same main characters.

<br /><br />3-5 small single player showcase maps: displaying advanced modelling, texturing, lighting, physics, coding etc, each with its own theme e.g. horror, sci-fi, fantasy, modern day, stroggos.
<br />In addition to each of the showcase maps we have multi player maps which follow the same theme as their single player parent but geared more towards performance rather than graphics and effects.
<br />Assets from ‘both’ could be used for other ideas such as short stories and which in turn could provide assets for the single and multi player maps.
<br /><br />All the textures and models used in the single player showcase maps could be rendered/projected out to simpler assets to be used in the lower poly multiplayer maps. But this doesn’t mean the multiplayer maps can’t exist until the single player maps have been started they can both be worked on in tandem providing assets for each other.
<br /><br />There’s my 2 cents, it was probably more bias towards modelling and texturing because that’s what im into, but the main idea im trying to get across is to try and create a productive flow which exchanges between all projects.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p171668" date="Posted: Tue Feb 27, 2007 6:24 am "><author>The Happy Friar</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">updated the first post.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225095502im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Ya know Jack... your last idea sounds like "house.map" in my mod, except I didn't bother to make it so you gotta keep the generator going (thought about it but couldn't think of a reason to as you didn't need to be in the house).</div>]]></body></post><post id="p171679" date="Posted: Tue Feb 27, 2007 9:26 am "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">No Nazi stuff please, thanks.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p171689" date="Posted: Tue Feb 27, 2007 2:03 pm "><author>Jack Rammsdell</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">The Happy Friar wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">updated the first post.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225095502im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Ya know Jack... your last idea sounds like "house.map" in my mod, except I didn't bother to make it so you gotta keep the generator going (thought about it but couldn't think of a reason to as you didn't need to be in the house).</div>

<br /><div class="quotetitle">The Happy Friar off original idea by Dinky wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Do a Doom 3 mod simular to the idea behind the Simpsons episode "22 short films about springfield."  It would be short sections (eposidioc like) based around the Doom 3 universe.  The reason I like this is that stary 1 could be based around you being one of the guys from Bravo company that gets slaughtered, another could be you're "Bob the Imp" (from planetdoom's comic) &amp; go on an adventure as him, one could be you walk through a teleporter &amp; end up in an "alternate universe" where the demons made teleporters &amp; marines are invading hell (as the bad guys).   Along the same lines would be an idea like the "Simpsons Spinoff Showcase" where the storys aren't all in the D3 universe.  <br /><br />Imagination is the limit.  Lots of D3 assets will be used so we won't depend on all new weapon models, code, assets, levels, etc.  We can do more creative stuff though, like make new weapons, a new baddie or two, put in more puzzle's (i really liked this about Prey).  <br /><br />Also, modders will be able to work on parts they like.  Me, for example, doesn't really want to do a super-serious mod, so me &amp; a couple other modders could work on a short story that gets kinda silly.<br /><br />A HUGE advantage I see to this type of mod is the attention span of the modders.  We won't be spending months to years on one single idea.  I feel with more variety we'll have less modders who start just disapear for no reason.<br /><br />The biggest problem I see is the coding.  If I want a weapon system that uses duel-weapons seperetly (ala "RTH") &amp; someone else wants all alt-fire, that could be a problem (i'm not a great coder so, as far as I'm concerned, if i can't figure it out i'm not doing the right thing!).  Problems along that line.</div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Jack Rammsdell wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I have several ideas, but I am not going to share them all at once.

I know it may seem boring to some people who live off violence, but it would be something that would be accepted by a large community and could be enjoyed by a larger group of people.  It would be a good opportunity to mix both real world and fantasy settings.

So the idea is a 3rd person survival horror mod that is based in modern time in a small town. The concept is when the power goes out the demons come. every 10 mins the town will blackout and you must try to keep a generator running to decrease the amount of time that the power is out for a better chance of survival. so you must find items such as a flashlight, weapons, fuel, food, batteries ect.. to survive the blackouts.<br /><br />There would be no need to create a whole town, just a house with a backyard and a wooden fence to keep you in.<br /><br />If thirdperson isn't possible, then it would be just as fun in firstperson, because then you would have a chance to have a more interactive enviroment and allow the player to open cabinets and drawers and all sorts of stuff to search for much needed items. </div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">mikebart wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I’ll contribute where I can but I couldn’t commit full time, I’m way too unreliable at the moment, I’ve got a few ideas for the project though, just a simple brief really im sure a few things have been said before.<br /><br />3-5 small single player showcase maps: displaying advanced modelling, texturing, lighting, physics, coding etc, each with its own theme e.g. horror, sci-fi, fantasy, modern day, stroggos.<br />In addition to each of the showcase maps we have multi player maps which follow the same theme as their single player parent but geared more towards performance rather than graphics and effects.<br />Assets from ‘both’ could be used for other ideas such as short stories and which in turn could provide assets for the single and multi player maps.<br /><br />All the textures and models used in the single player showcase maps could be rendered/projected out to simpler assets to be used in the lower poly multiplayer maps.

Doom 3 seems to be extremely well suited to a dark, greasy industrial era (lighting-wise).  Would be a good setting if the adventure were set in an all night raid and would minimize the number of NPC models necessary for the mod (a little less work), mostly just needing to re-skin current player models to fit them with more modern uniforms or prison outfits.

By small I don't necessarily mean content but in the actual mod size.  Even more specifically the number of maps being kept to a small numbers (maybe a half dozen or less).  This would be for a "first installment".  My reasons is one of the hardest things to keep a mod group going is the interest in it, if the project can have a near and clear ending then confidence of what the team is capable of will be significantly boosted, when the project is completed confidence gets an even bigger boost.  Using that inertia the project could be expanded.  Maybe even an episodic type of adventure like the Half Life 2 episodes (on a much smaller scale).
<br /><br />Other than this I think it's also important to nail down what kind of mod would be in mind.  Should this be a multiplayer mod or a singleplayer mod?  Keeping in mind what I said above, choosing one or the other would be smart and not trying to combine the two saving that for the "next installment" maybe.  Personally I'd be interested in seeing a single player game that featured some new objects (weapons, tools, etc.) that pushes the player to be more interactive with their world as opposed to the usual "if it moves, shoot it".  This might put a bit of emphasis on the programmer or whoever's handling level scripts though.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p171486" date="Posted: Sun Feb 25, 2007 2:32 am "><author>voldemort</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Well I would just like to say this I do mapping but layout is my downfall once blocked out and rough detailed --I like to go insane on detail items --so long as they dont affect fram rate that is Just figured I would share that since its my only real strength --preaty lame I know <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081204064433im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p171492" date="Posted: Sun Feb 25, 2007 3:44 am "><author>nbrancaccio</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Hey I like this idea!

<br />would be cool to do a "what if" kinda story,
<br />lets say the nazzis won ww2 (not totally illogical
<br />IF the nazi leadership under Hitler had removed him from
<br />power just before that idiotic twofront idea he had
<br />about invading Soviet in 1941) and then move the timeline forward
<br />to about 2030 or similar, Mars is still Mars etc but instead of Betruger
<br />call the scientist something like Himmler the fourth,
<br />Reinhard Heydrich the third or similar, you get the drift,
<br />and then fill Mars with nazi swastika, do a couple of new
<br />levels thats kinda were unreachable in vanilla doom
<br />(theres doors that cannot be opened in vanilla d3,
<br />those new maps could be reached by those doors),
<br />all this could be a lot like RTCW i guess, but i fail to see how
<br />THAT cannot be anything but good since RTCW pwned  ; )
<br />Imagine running around in doom 3 with a MP44,
<br />MG42, stiefelhandgranaten and a flammenverfer  hehehe

<br /><br />re: jack's "non-violent" idea...
<br /><br />that idea DOES sound interesting (myst-like, i've had the same idea along with pbmax), the only issue I see is that the only people who would play are people who already owned D3, which is violent.  Do you think people would re-install D3 for that, or perhaps, BUY a copy of D3 for that?  (obviously if it's good enough).  That would be a killer idea for a full-fledged game though.
<br /><br />Me &amp; PBMax threw around a few ideas months ago.  One I had was a game where space-sheep are invading earth &amp; space-goats are defending it.  Pretty much you can imagine how that winds up just from the sheep &amp; goat motif.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081204064433im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />  Lots of cloven-betrayal in there!

<br /><br />If you're referring to my short story idea &amp; that's what you took it at I need to explain better:  It's not a MEGA-mod, it's a mod that doesn't have one central theme, it's one short story after another.  Not necessarily all done at once.  So I didn't intend to promote an "all-inclusive" mod, but more a a collection of story's, like a collection of Sci-Fi story's.  I guess the closest relation to my idea would be Doom 1, Q1 or AvP where each "episode" is different but tied together with the same main characters.

People throw out your ideas (don't forget that, odds are, amatures will be working on this to so don't except "RTH" or "Dark Mod" quality.  Just HOPE it!).  iI'm imagining something closer to "Duck Nukem" quality (being realistic here!)  iThen we'll vote.&#13;<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">IDEAS: </span></span>&#13;<br /><div class="quotetitle">The Happy Friar off original idea by Dinky wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Do a Doom 3 mod simular to the idea behind the Simpsons episode "22 short films about springfield."  It would be short sections (eposidioc like) based around the Doom 3 universe.  The reason I like this is that stary 1 could be based around you being one of the guys from Bravo company that gets slaughtered, another could be you're "Bob the Imp" (from planetdoom's comic) &amp; go on an adventure as him, one could be you walk through a teleporter &amp; end up in an "alternate universe" where the demons made teleporters &amp; marines are invading hell (as the bad guys).   Along the same lines would be an idea like the "Simpsons Spinoff Showcase" where the storys aren't all in the D3 universe.  <br /><br />Imagination is the limit.  Lots of D3 assets will be used so we won't depend on all new weapon models, code, assets, levels, etc.  We can do more creative stuff though, like make new weapons, a new baddie or two, put in more puzzle's (i really liked this about Prey).  <br /><br />Also, modders will be able to work on parts they like.  Me, for example, doesn't really want to do a super-serious mod, so me &amp; a couple other modders could work on a short story that gets kinda silly.<br /><br />A HUGE advantage I see to this type of mod is the attention span of the modders.  We won't be spending months to years on one single idea.  I feel with more variety we'll have less modders who start just disapear for no reason.<br /><br />The biggest problem I see is the coding.  If I want a weapon system that uses duel-weapons seperetly (ala "RTH") &amp; someone else wants all alt-fire, that could be a problem (i'm not a great coder so, as far as I'm concerned, if i can't figure it out i'm not doing the right thing!).

So the idea is a 3rd person survival horror mod that is based in modern time in a small town. The concept is when the power goes out the demons come. every 10 mins the town will blackout and you must try to keep a generator running to decrease the amount of time that the power is out for a better chance of survival. so you must find items such as a flashlight, weapons, fuel, food, batteries ect.. to survive the blackouts.<br /><br />There would be no need to create a whole town, just a house with a backyard and a wooden fence to keep you in.<br /><br />If thirdperson isn't possible, then it would be just as fun in firstperson, because then you would have a chance to have a more interactive enviroment and allow the player to open cabinets and drawers and all sorts of stuff to search for much needed items. </div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">mikebart wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I’ll contribute where I can but I couldn’t commit full time, I’m way too unreliable at the moment, I’ve got a few ideas for the project though, just a simple brief really im sure a few things have been said before.<br /><br />3-5 small single player showcase maps: displaying advanced modelling, texturing, lighting, physics, coding etc, each with its own theme e.g. horror, sci-fi, fantasy, modern day, stroggos.<br />In addition to each of the showcase maps we have multi player maps which follow the same theme as their single player parent but geared more towards performance rather than graphics and effects.<br />Assets from ‘both’ could be used for other ideas such as short stories and which in turn could provide assets for the single and multi player maps.<br /><br />All the textures and models used in the single player showcase maps could be rendered/projected out to simpler assets to be used in the lower poly multiplayer maps.

Doom 3 seems to be extremely well suited to a dark, greasy industrial era (lighting-wise).  Would be a good setting if the adventure were set in an all night raid and would minimize the number of NPC models necessary for the mod (a little less work), mostly just needing to re-skin current player models to fit them with more modern uniforms or prison outfits.

By small I don't necessarily mean content but in the actual mod size.  Even more specifically the number of maps being kept to a small numbers (maybe a half dozen or less).  This would be for a "first installment".  My reasons is one of the hardest things to keep a mod group going is the interest in it, if the project can have a near and clear ending then confidence of what the team is capable of will be significantly boosted, when the project is completed confidence gets an even bigger boost.  Using that inertia the project could be expanded.  Maybe even an episodic type of adventure like the Half Life 2 episodes (on a much smaller scale).&#13;<br /><br />Other than this I think it's also important to nail down what kind of mod would be in mind.  Should this be a multiplayer mod or a singleplayer mod?  Keeping in mind what I said above, choosing one or the other would be smart and not trying to combine the two saving that for the "next installment" maybe.  Personally I'd be interested in seeing a single player game that featured some new objects (weapons, tools, etc.) that pushes the player to be more interactive with their world as opposed to the usual "if it moves, shoot it".  This might put a bit of emphasis on the programmer or whoever's handling level scripts though.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p171486" date="Posted: Sun Feb 25, 2007 2:32 am "><author>voldemort</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Well I would just like to say this I do mapping but layout is my downfall once blocked out and rough detailed --I like to go insane on detail items --so long as they dont affect fram rate that is Just figured I would share that since its my only real strength --preaty lame I know <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p171492" date="Posted: Sun Feb 25, 2007 3:44 am "><author>nbrancaccio</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Hey I like this idea!

That would be a killer idea for a full-fledged game though.&#13;<br /><br />Me &amp; PBMax threw around a few ideas months ago.  One I had was a game where space-sheep are invading earth &amp; space-goats are defending it.  Pretty much you can imagine how that winds up just from the sheep &amp; goat motif.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />  Lots of cloven-betrayal in there!&#13;<br /><br />But that's what I like about the modular/eposidic/short story based mod idea.  The whistle can be wet in different types of ideas.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p171595" date="Posted: Mon Feb 26, 2007 1:31 pm "><author>Jack Rammsdell</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">What about a Deathmatch mod with gothic, industrial, and technology based enviroments that brought in the feel of quake 3 and the looks of quake 4.

						<div class="postbody">referencing <a href="viewtopic.php?t=18836" class="postlink">the Mod Idea Thread</a>, lets think of idea for the mod.  People throw out your ideas (don't forget that, odds are, amatures will be working on this to so don't except "RTH" or "Dark Mod" quality.  Just HOPE it!).  iI'm imagining something closer to "Duck Nukem" quality (being realistic here!)  iThen we'll vote.&#13;<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">IDEAS: </span></span>&#13;<br /><div class="quotetitle">The Happy Friar off original idea by Dinky wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Do a Doom 3 mod simular to the idea behind the Simpsons episode "22 short films about springfield."  It would be short sections (eposidioc like) based around the Doom 3 universe.  The reason I like this is that stary 1 could be based around you being one of the guys from Bravo company that gets slaughtered, another could be you're "Bob the Imp" (from planetdoom's comic) &amp; go on an adventure as him, one could be you walk through a teleporter &amp; end up in an "alternate universe" where the demons made teleporters &amp; marines are invading hell (as the bad guys).   Along the same lines would be an idea like the "Simpsons Spinoff Showcase" where the storys aren't all in the D3 universe.  <br /><br />Imagination is the limit.  Lots of D3 assets will be used so we won't depend on all new weapon models, code, assets, levels, etc.  We can do more creative stuff though, like make new weapons, a new baddie or two, put in more puzzle's (i really liked this about Prey).  <br /><br />Also, modders will be able to work on parts they like.  Me, for example, doesn't really want to do a super-serious mod, so me &amp; a couple other modders could work on a short story that gets kinda silly.<br /><br />A HUGE advantage I see to this type of mod is the attention span of the modders.  We won't be spending months to years on one single idea.  I feel with more variety we'll have less modders who start just disapear for no reason.<br /><br />The biggest problem I see is the coding.  If I want a weapon system that uses duel-weapons seperetly (ala "RTH") &amp; someone else wants all alt-fire, that could be a problem (i'm not a great coder so, as far as I'm concerned, if i can't figure it out i'm not doing the right thing!).  Problems along that line.</div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Jack Rammsdell wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I have several ideas, but I am not going to share them all at once.  How about doing something that almost every doom 3 mod isn't, why not make a completly non-violent mod where the player is on a quest to find his way home and encounters a variety of puzzles and task sequences.  I know it may seem boring to some people who live off violence, but it would be something that would be accepted by a large community and could be enjoyed by a larger group of people.  It would be a good opportunity to mix both real world and fantasy settings.  With settings such as a haunted castle or other strange enviroments that could be seen in a sort of riven or myst game.  </div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">vinnie_jones wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><span style="font-weight: bold">removed</span> </div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Jack Rammsdell wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">What about a Deathmatch mod with gothic, industrial, and technology based enviroments that brought in the feel of quake 3 and the looks of quake 4.  With enhanced deathmatch physics and possibly tinman's bot support.  So then mappers can go off and map their own ideas and no matter how different the style is, it would fit with the project, unless someone was to pull a funny and make a map of all bunnies and colors <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> or something along that lines.<br />How about in every story there is a key character in a dangerous situation and ultimately survives. Then each charcter is brought before the vadrigar themselves and thrown into an arena to fight, so now we are mixing the short stories, deathmatch and quake 3</div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bo$bevok wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">i say we make a doom3 game set on earth...<br /><br />if we do the short story idea we could have a chapter or level or whatever on earth</div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Jack Rammsdell wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">last saturday our town was hit with a heavy sleet that knocked the power off for a few hours. which gave me an idea for a small survival horror scenario.<br /><br />I've always wanted to do 3rd person because it was so differnt from the standard FPS games we all play. So the idea is a 3rd person survival horror mod that is based in modern time in a small town. The concept is when the power goes out the demons come. every 10 mins the town will blackout and you must try to keep a generator running to decrease the amount of time that the power is out for a better chance of survival. so you must find items such as a flashlight, weapons, fuel, food, batteries ect.. to survive the blackouts.<br /><br />There would be no need to create a whole town, just a house with a backyard and a wooden fence to keep you in.<br /><br />If thirdperson isn't possible, then it would be just as fun in firstperson, because then you would have a chance to have a more interactive enviroment and allow the player to open cabinets and drawers and all sorts of stuff to search for much needed items. </div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">mikebart wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I’ll contribute where I can but I couldn’t commit full time, I’m way too unreliable at the moment, I’ve got a few ideas for the project though, just a simple brief really im sure a few things have been said before.<br /><br />3-5 small single player showcase maps: displaying advanced modelling, texturing, lighting, physics, coding etc, each with its own theme e.g. horror, sci-fi, fantasy, modern day, stroggos.<br />In addition to each of the showcase maps we have multi player maps which follow the same theme as their single player parent but geared more towards performance rather than graphics and effects.<br />Assets from ‘both’ could be used for other ideas such as short stories and which in turn could provide assets for the single and multi player maps.<br /><br />All the textures and models used in the single player showcase maps could be rendered/projected out to simpler assets to be used in the lower poly multiplayer maps. But this doesn’t mean the multiplayer maps can’t exist until the single player maps have been started they can both be worked on in tandem providing assets for each other.</div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">6th Venom wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Do you remember about "Code Quantum" (Quantum Leap) tv serie?<br /><br />In this tv serie, a man travel in the time and become another person (the one he must help or save) the time of an episode, when he change this person destiny, don't know how or why, he is projected in the time one more time, etc...<br /><br />To keep maps linked, could make a similar thing, allowing different physical heroes, different places and times, but with a strong storyline in the back of each adventures.</div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bittoman wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">A time traveling platoon of Strogg comes to early industrial Earth.  Invading a military base they manage to blow a whole in the side of the brigg.  You are a military prisoner who escapes and ends up fending for himself while trying to battle the Strogg.  Cutting to the end you defeat the Strogg and earn a hero's medal.<br /><br />Kind of a Wolfenstein 3D with different characters.  Doom 3 seems to be extremely well suited to a dark, greasy industrial era (lighting-wise).  Would be a good setting if the adventure were set in an all night raid and would minimize the number of NPC models necessary for the mod (a little less work), mostly just needing to re-skin current player models to fit them with more modern uniforms or prison outfits.  I can see this done with a little Duke Nukem style humor too.</div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bittoman wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">It could be something done as an extension to the Doom 3 game so how about a role reversal where you're an Imp battling invading Marines?</div></div>

						<div class="postbody">I think it would be smart to start small.  By small I don't necessarily mean content but in the actual mod size.  Even more specifically the number of maps being kept to a small numbers (maybe a half dozen or less).  This would be for a "first installment".  My reasons is one of the hardest things to keep a mod group going is the interest in it, if the project can have a near and clear ending then confidence of what the team is capable of will be significantly boosted, when the project is completed confidence gets an even bigger boost.  Using that inertia the project could be expanded.  Maybe even an episodic type of adventure like the Half Life 2 episodes (on a much smaller scale).&#13;<br /><br />Other than this I think it's also important to nail down what kind of mod would be in mind.  Should this be a multiplayer mod or a singleplayer mod?  Keeping in mind what I said above, choosing one or the other would be smart and not trying to combine the two saving that for the "next installment" maybe.  Personally I'd be interested in seeing a single player game that featured some new objects (weapons, tools, etc.) that pushes the player to be more interactive with their world as opposed to the usual "if it moves, shoot it".  This might put a bit of emphasis on the programmer or whoever's handling level scripts though.</div>

						<div class="postbody">Hey I like this idea! As you stated, it is a perfect solution for mod makers with all types of attention spans haha! Plus, it would be great for someone like myself, who is definatly interested in creating all sorts of assets, models, textures, maps you name it, but don't quite have the dedication for a full time mod, but at the same time, dont want my stuff going unused. This could really be a lot of fun.&#13;<br /><br />I also liked your idea on having a sense of humor about it. I think mods these days are far too serious and try to be too professional, when they are truely missing the whole advantage of being modders: there is no distributor telling you what to do! You can be as edgy, wild, and crazy as you like <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />I could provide vurtually anything visual: Models, textures, texture sets, custom skyboxes... this could be fun!&#13;<br /><br />Episodic is also key: simply releasing anything puts you a step above most other mod makers as most do not get released. Episodic releases would expedite this release.&#13;<br /><br />nice!</div>

						<div class="postbody">I have several ideas, but I am not going to share them all at once.  How about doing something that almost every doom 3 mod isn't, why not make a completly non-violent mod where the player is on a quest to find his way home and encounters a variety of puzzles and task sequences.  I know it may seem boring to some people who live off violence, but it would be something that would be accepted by a large community and could be enjoyed by a larger group of people.  It would be a good opportunity to mix both real world and fantasy settings.  With settings such as a haunted castle or other strange enviroments that could be seen in a sort of riven or myst game.  &#13;<br /><br />I have 3 other ideas that are all completly differnt, so I'll get them sorted out and share them another time.</div>

						<div class="postbody">i didn't intend for this thread to critique ideas, just to post them (and perhaps more clarifying questions).&#13;<br /><br />While I agree about the "Action is needed" stance, look at HL2.  The action there was filler between mono logs.  Yet that game still sold (honestly, i STILL don't know why).&#13;<br /><br />re: jack's "non-violent" idea...&#13;<br /><br />that idea DOES sound interesting (myst-like, i've had the same idea along with pbmax), the only issue I see is that the only people who would play are people who already owned D3, which is violent.  Do you think people would re-install D3 for that, or perhaps, BUY a copy of D3 for that?  (obviously if it's good enough).  That would be a killer idea for a full-fledged game though.&#13;<br /><br />Me &amp; PBMax threw around a few ideas months ago.  One I had was a game where space-sheep are invading earth &amp; space-goats are defending it.  Pretty much you can imagine how that winds up just from the sheep &amp; goat motif.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />  Lots of cloven-betrayal in there!&#13;<br /><br />But that's what I like about the modular/eposidic/short story based mod idea.  The whistle can be wet in different types of ideas.</div>

So the idea is a 3rd person survival horror mod that is based in modern time in a small town. The concept is when the power goes out the demons come. every 10 mins the town will blackout and you must try to keep a generator running to decrease the amount of time that the power is out for a better chance of survival. so you must find items such as a flashlight, weapons, fuel, food, batteries ect.. to survive the blackouts.<br /><br />There would be no need to create a whole town, just a house with a backyard and a wooden fence to keep you in.<br /><br />If thirdperson isn't possible, then it would be just as fun in firstperson, because then you would have a chance to have a more interactive enviroment and allow the player to open cabinets and drawers and all sorts of stuff to search for much needed items. </div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">mikebart wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I’ll contribute where I can but I couldn’t commit full time, I’m way too unreliable at the moment, I’ve got a few ideas for the project though, just a simple brief really im sure a few things have been said before.<br /><br />3-5 small single player showcase maps: displaying advanced modelling, texturing, lighting, physics, coding etc, each with its own theme e.g. horror, sci-fi, fantasy, modern day, stroggos.<br />In addition to each of the showcase maps we have multi player maps which follow the same theme as their single player parent but geared more towards performance rather than graphics and effects.<br />Assets from ‘both’ could be used for other ideas such as short stories and which in turn could provide assets for the single and multi player maps.<br /><br />All the textures and models used in the single player showcase maps could be rendered/projected out to simpler assets to be used in the lower poly multiplayer maps. But this doesn’t mean the multiplayer maps can’t exist until the single player maps have been started they can both be worked on in tandem providing assets for each other.</div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">6th Venom wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Do you remember about "Code Quantum" (Quantum Leap) tv serie?<br /><br />In this tv serie, a man travel in the time and become another person (the one he must help or save) the time of an episode, when he change this person destiny, don't know how or why, he is projected in the time one more time, etc...<br /><br />To keep maps linked, could make a similar thing, allowing different physical heroes, different places and times, but with a strong storyline in the back of each adventures.</div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bittoman wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">A time traveling platoon of Strogg comes to early industrial Earth.  Invading a military base they manage to blow a whole in the side of the brigg.  You are a military prisoner who escapes and ends up fending for himself while trying to battle the Strogg.  Cutting to the end you defeat the Strogg and earn a hero's medal.<br /><br />Kind of a Wolfenstein 3D with different characters.  Doom 3 seems to be extremely well suited to a dark, greasy industrial era (lighting-wise).  Would be a good setting if the adventure were set in an all night raid and would minimize the number of NPC models necessary for the mod (a little less work), mostly just needing to re-skin current player models to fit them with more modern uniforms or prison outfits.  I can see this done with a little Duke Nukem style humor too.</div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bittoman wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">It could be something done as an extension to the Doom 3 game so how about a role reversal where you're an Imp battling invading Marines?</div></div>]]></body></post><post id="p171485" date="Posted: Sun Feb 25, 2007 2:26 am "><author>Bittoman</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I think it would be smart to start small.  By small I don't necessarily mean content but in the actual mod size.  Even more specifically the number of maps being kept to a small numbers (maybe a half dozen or less).  This would be for a "first installment".  My reasons is one of the hardest things to keep a mod group going is the interest in it, if the project can have a near and clear ending then confidence of what the team is capable of will be significantly boosted, when the project is completed confidence gets an even bigger boost.  Using that inertia the project could be expanded.  Maybe even an episodic type of adventure like the Half Life 2 episodes (on a much smaller scale).
<br /><br />Other than this I think it's also important to nail down what kind of mod would be in mind.  Should this be a multiplayer mod or a singleplayer mod?  Keeping in mind what I said above, choosing one or the other would be smart and not trying to combine the two saving that for the "next installment" maybe.  Personally I'd be interested in seeing a single player game that featured some new objects (weapons, tools, etc.) that pushes the player to be more interactive with their world as opposed to the usual "if it moves, shoot it".  This might put a bit of emphasis on the programmer or whoever's handling level scripts though.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p171486" date="Posted: Sun Feb 25, 2007 2:32 am "><author>voldemort</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Well I would just like to say this I do mapping but layout is my downfall once blocked out and rough detailed --I like to go insane on detail items --so long as they dont affect fram rate that is Just figured I would share that since its my only real strength --preaty lame I know <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p171492" date="Posted: Sun Feb 25, 2007 3:44 am "><author>nbrancaccio</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Hey I like this idea! As you stated, it is a perfect solution for mod makers with all types of attention spans haha! Plus, it would be great for someone like myself, who is definatly interested in creating all sorts of assets, models, textures, maps you name it, but don't quite have the dedication for a full time mod, but at the same time, dont want my stuff going unused. This could really be a lot of fun.
<br /><br />I also liked your idea on having a sense of humor about it. I think mods these days are far too serious and try to be too professional, when they are truely missing the whole advantage of being modders: there is no distributor telling you what to do! You can be as edgy, wild, and crazy as you like <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />I could provide vurtually anything visual: Models, textures, texture sets, custom skyboxes... this could be fun!
<br /><br />Episodic is also key: simply releasing anything puts you a step above most other mod makers as most do not get released. Episodic releases would expedite this release.
<br /><br />nice!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p171500" date="Posted: Sun Feb 25, 2007 6:14 am "><author>Jack Rammsdell</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I have several ideas, but I am not going to share them all at once.

<br />would be cool to do a "what if" kinda story,
<br />lets say the nazzis won ww2 (not totally illogical
<br />IF the nazi leadership under Hitler had removed him from
<br />power just before that idiotic twofront idea he had
<br />about invading Soviet in 1941) and then move the timeline forward
<br />to about 2030 or similar, Mars is still Mars etc but instead of Betruger
<br />call the scientist something like Himmler the fourth,
<br />Reinhard Heydrich the third or similar, you get the drift,
<br />and then fill Mars with nazi swastika, do a couple of new
<br />levels thats kinda were unreachable in vanilla doom
<br />(theres doors that cannot be opened in vanilla d3,
<br />those new maps could be reached by those doors),
<br />all this could be a lot like RTCW i guess, but i fail to see how
<br />THAT cannot be anything but good since RTCW pwned  ; )
<br />Imagine running around in doom 3 with a MP44,
<br />MG42, stiefelhandgranaten and a flammenverfer  hehehe

<br />that And the default walk pace is to slow for action but perfect for a terror level where you expect stuff to pop out
<br /><br />So depending on what we want
<br />If we want action
<br />Definalty need to pick up the pace
<br />if we decide on horor it can go either way
<br /><br />If we do the pop out of the walls trick like ID  then slow for sure
<br />But if we use enviroment and audio to do the trick we can pick up the pace and still instill terror
<br /><br />One of the things That was missing between this doom and the first and second was  a fast pace of action --but this one definatly creates more an atmosphere
<br /><br />I agree on the doom3 engine to much was stripped from the q4 engine in my opinion  it just dosnt look as good --maybe thats just me but I still think the original d3 looks the best</div>]]></body></post><post id="p171575" date="Posted: Mon Feb 26, 2007 3:40 am "><author>Jack Rammsdell</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">In my opinion, action is the only way to go, to get everyones interest, I didn't like doom 3 in some parts because it was slow and you could always expect somone to pop out of left field.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p171580" date="Posted: Mon Feb 26, 2007 4:43 am "><author>The Happy Friar</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">i didn't intend for this thread to critique ideas, just to post them (and perhaps more clarifying questions).
<br /><br />While I agree about the "Action is needed" stance, look at HL2.  The action there was filler between mono logs.  Yet that game still sold (honestly, i STILL don't know why).
<br /><br />re: jack's "non-violent" idea...
<br /><br />that idea DOES sound interesting (myst-like, i've had the same idea along with pbmax), the only issue I see is that the only people who would play are people who already owned D3, which is violent.  Do you think people would re-install D3 for that, or perhaps, BUY a copy of D3 for that?  (obviously if it's good enough).  That would be a killer idea for a full-fledged game though.
<br /><br />Me &amp; PBMax threw around a few ideas months ago.  One I had was a game where space-sheep are invading earth &amp; space-goats are defending it.  Pretty much you can imagine how that winds up just from the sheep &amp; goat motif.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />  Lots of cloven-betrayal in there!
<br /><br />But that's what I like about the modular/eposidic/short story based mod idea.

<br />would be cool to do a "what if" kinda story,
<br />lets say the nazzis won ww2 (not totally illogical
<br />IF the nazi leadership under Hitler had removed him from
<br />power just before that idiotic twofront idea he had
<br />about invading Soviet in 1941) and then move the timeline forward
<br />to about 2030 or similar, Mars is still Mars etc but instead of Betruger
<br />call the scientist something like Himmler the fourth,
<br />Reinhard Heydrich the third or similar, you get the drift,
<br />and then fill Mars with nazi swastika, do a couple of new
<br />levels thats kinda were unreachable in vanilla doom
<br />(theres doors that cannot be opened in vanilla d3,
<br />those new maps could be reached by those doors),
<br />all this could be a lot like RTCW i guess, but i fail to see how
<br />THAT cannot be anything but good since RTCW pwned  ; )
<br />Imagine running around in doom 3 with a MP44,
<br />MG42, stiefelhandgranaten and a flammenverfer  hehehe

<br />If we want action
<br />Definalty need to pick up the pace
<br />if we decide on horor it can go either way
<br /><br />If we do the pop out of the walls trick like ID  then slow for sure
<br />But if we use enviroment and audio to do the trick we can pick up the pace and still instill terror
<br /><br />One of the things That was missing between this doom and the first and second was  a fast pace of action --but this one definatly creates more an atmosphere

<br /><br />While I agree about the "Action is needed" stance, look at HL2.  The action there was filler between mono logs.  Yet that game still sold (honestly, i STILL don't know why).
<br /><br />re: jack's "non-violent" idea...
<br /><br />that idea DOES sound interesting (myst-like, i've had the same idea along with pbmax), the only issue I see is that the only people who would play are people who already owned D3, which is violent.  Do you think people would re-install D3 for that, or perhaps, BUY a copy of D3 for that?  (obviously if it's good enough).  That would be a killer idea for a full-fledged game though.
<br /><br />Me &amp; PBMax threw around a few ideas months ago.  One I had was a game where space-sheep are invading earth &amp; space-goats are defending it.  Pretty much you can imagine how that winds up just from the sheep &amp; goat motif.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />  Lots of cloven-betrayal in there!

<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">IDEAS: </span></span>
<br /><div class="quotetitle">The Happy Friar off original idea by Dinky wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Do a Doom 3 mod simular to the idea behind the Simpsons episode "22 short films about springfield."  It would be short sections (eposidioc like) based around the Doom 3 universe.  The reason I like this is that stary 1 could be based around you being one of the guys from Bravo company that gets slaughtered, another could be you're "Bob the Imp" (from planetdoom's comic) &amp; go on an adventure as him, one could be you walk through a teleporter &amp; end up in an "alternate universe" where the demons made teleporters &amp; marines are invading hell (as the bad guys).   Along the same lines would be an idea like the "Simpsons Spinoff Showcase" where the storys aren't all in the D3 universe.  <br /><br />Imagination is the limit.  Lots of D3 assets will be used so we won't depend on all new weapon models, code, assets, levels, etc.  We can do more creative stuff though, like make new weapons, a new baddie or two, put in more puzzle's (i really liked this about Prey).  <br /><br />Also, modders will be able to work on parts they like.  Me, for example, doesn't really want to do a super-serious mod, so me &amp; a couple other modders could work on a short story that gets kinda silly.<br /><br />A HUGE advantage I see to this type of mod is the attention span of the modders.  We won't be spending months to years on one single idea.  I feel with more variety we'll have less modders who start just disapear for no reason.<br /><br />The biggest problem I see is the coding.  If I want a weapon system that uses duel-weapons seperetly (ala "RTH") &amp; someone else wants all alt-fire, that could be a problem (i'm not a great coder so, as far as I'm concerned, if i can't figure it out i'm not doing the right thing!).

It would be a good opportunity to mix both real world and fantasy settings.  With settings such as a haunted castle or other strange enviroments that could be seen in a sort of riven or myst game.

People throw out your ideas (don't forget that, odds are, amatures will be working on this to so don't except "RTH" or "Dark Mod" quality.

<br /><div class="quotetitle">The Happy Friar off original idea by Dinky wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Do a Doom 3 mod simular to the idea behind the Simpsons episode "22 short films about springfield."  It would be short sections (eposidioc like) based around the Doom 3 universe.  The reason I like this is that stary 1 could be based around you being one of the guys from Bravo company that gets slaughtered, another could be you're "Bob the Imp" (from planetdoom's comic) &amp; go on an adventure as him, one could be you walk through a teleporter &amp; end up in an "alternate universe" where the demons made teleporters &amp; marines are invading hell (as the bad guys).   Along the same lines would be an idea like the "Simpsons Spinoff Showcase" where the storys aren't all in the D3 universe.  <br /><br />Imagination is the limit.  Lots of D3 assets will be used so we won't depend on all new weapon models, code, assets, levels, etc.  We can do more creative stuff though, like make new weapons, a new baddie or two, put in more puzzle's (i really liked this about Prey).  <br /><br />Also, modders will be able to work on parts they like.  Me, for example, doesn't really want to do a super-serious mod, so me &amp; a couple other modders could work on a short story that gets kinda silly.<br /><br />A HUGE advantage I see to this type of mod is the attention span of the modders.  We won't be spending months to years on one single idea.  I feel with more variety we'll have less modders who start just disapear for no reason.<br /><br />The biggest problem I see is the coding.  If I want a weapon system that uses duel-weapons seperetly (ala "RTH") &amp; someone else wants all alt-fire, that could be a problem (i'm not a great coder so, as far as I'm concerned, if i can't figure it out i'm not doing the right thing!).  Problems along that line.</div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Jack Rammsdell wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I have several ideas, but I am not going to share them all at once.

So the idea is a 3rd person survival horror mod that is based in modern time in a small town. The concept is when the power goes out the demons come. every 10 mins the town will blackout and you must try to keep a generator running to decrease the amount of time that the power is out for a better chance of survival. so you must find items such as a flashlight, weapons, fuel, food, batteries ect.. to survive the blackouts.<br /><br />There would be no need to create a whole town, just a house with a backyard and a wooden fence to keep you in.<br /><br />If thirdperson isn't possible, then it would be just as fun in firstperson, because then you would have a chance to have a more interactive enviroment and allow the player to open cabinets and drawers and all sorts of stuff to search for much needed items. </div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">mikebart wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I’ll contribute where I can but I couldn’t commit full time, I’m way too unreliable at the moment, I’ve got a few ideas for the project though, just a simple brief really im sure a few things have been said before.<br /><br />3-5 small single player showcase maps: displaying advanced modelling, texturing, lighting, physics, coding etc, each with its own theme e.g. horror, sci-fi, fantasy, modern day, stroggos.<br />In addition to each of the showcase maps we have multi player maps which follow the same theme as their single player parent but geared more towards performance rather than graphics and effects.<br />Assets from ‘both’ could be used for other ideas such as short stories and which in turn could provide assets for the single and multi player maps.<br /><br />All the textures and models used in the single player showcase maps could be rendered/projected out to simpler assets to be used in the lower poly multiplayer maps. But this doesn’t mean the multiplayer maps can’t exist until the single player maps have been started they can both be worked on in tandem providing assets for each other.</div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">6th Venom wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Do you remember about "Code Quantum" (Quantum Leap) tv serie?<br /><br />In this tv serie, a man travel in the time and become another person (the one he must help or save) the time of an episode, when he change this person destiny, don't know how or why, he is projected in the time one more time, etc...<br /><br />To keep maps linked, could make a similar thing, allowing different physical heroes, different places and times, but with a strong storyline in the back of each adventures.</div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bittoman wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">A time traveling platoon of Strogg comes to early industrial Earth.  Invading a military base they manage to blow a whole in the side of the brigg.  You are a military prisoner who escapes and ends up fending for himself while trying to battle the Strogg.  Cutting to the end you defeat the Strogg and earn a hero's medal.<br /><br />Kind of a Wolfenstein 3D with different characters.  Doom 3 seems to be extremely well suited to a dark, greasy industrial era (lighting-wise).  Would be a good setting if the adventure were set in an all night raid and would minimize the number of NPC models necessary for the mod (a little less work), mostly just needing to re-skin current player models to fit them with more modern uniforms or prison outfits.  I can see this done with a little Duke Nukem style humor too.</div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bittoman wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">It could be something done as an extension to the Doom 3 game so how about a role reversal where you're an Imp battling invading Marines?</div></div>]]></body></post><post id="p171485" date="Posted: Sun Feb 25, 2007 2:26 am "><author>Bittoman</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I think it would be smart to start small.  By small I don't necessarily mean content but in the actual mod size.  Even more specifically the number of maps being kept to a small numbers (maybe a half dozen or less).  This would be for a "first installment".  My reasons is one of the hardest things to keep a mod group going is the interest in it, if the project can have a near and clear ending then confidence of what the team is capable of will be significantly boosted, when the project is completed confidence gets an even bigger boost.  Using that inertia the project could be expanded.  Maybe even an episodic type of adventure like the Half Life 2 episodes (on a much smaller scale).
<br /><br />Other than this I think it's also important to nail down what kind of mod would be in mind.  Should this be a multiplayer mod or a singleplayer mod?  Keeping in mind what I said above, choosing one or the other would be smart and not trying to combine the two saving that for the "next installment" maybe.  Personally I'd be interested in seeing a single player game that featured some new objects (weapons, tools, etc.) that pushes the player to be more interactive with their world as opposed to the usual "if it moves, shoot it".  This might put a bit of emphasis on the programmer or whoever's handling level scripts though.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p171486" date="Posted: Sun Feb 25, 2007 2:32 am "><author>voldemort</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Well I would just like to say this I do mapping but layout is my downfall once blocked out and rough detailed --I like to go insane on detail items --so long as they dont affect fram rate that is Just figured I would share that since its my only real strength --preaty lame I know <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p171492" date="Posted: Sun Feb 25, 2007 3:44 am "><author>nbrancaccio</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Hey I like this idea! As you stated, it is a perfect solution for mod makers with all types of attention spans haha! Plus, it would be great for someone like myself, who is definatly interested in creating all sorts of assets, models, textures, maps you name it, but don't quite have the dedication for a full time mod, but at the same time, dont want my stuff going unused. This could really be a lot of fun.
<br /><br />I also liked your idea on having a sense of humor about it. I think mods these days are far too serious and try to be too professional, when they are truely missing the whole advantage of being modders: there is no distributor telling you what to do! You can be as edgy, wild, and crazy as you like <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />I could provide vurtually anything visual: Models, textures, texture sets, custom skyboxes... this could be fun!
<br /><br />Episodic is also key: simply releasing anything puts you a step above most other mod makers as most do not get released. Episodic releases would expedite this release.

						<div class="postbody">referencing <a href="viewtopic.php?t=18836" class="postlink">the Mod Idea Thread</a>, lets think of idea for the mod.  People throw out your ideas (don't forget that, odds are, amatures will be working on this to so don't except "RTH" or "Dark Mod" quality.  Just HOPE it!).  iI'm imagining something closer to "Duck Nukem" quality (being realistic here!)  iThen we'll vote.
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">IDEAS: </span></span>
<br /><div class="quotetitle">The Happy Friar off original idea by Dinky wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Do a Doom 3 mod simular to the idea behind the Simpsons episode "22 short films about springfield."  It would be short sections (eposidioc like) based around the Doom 3 universe.  The reason I like this is that stary 1 could be based around you being one of the guys from Bravo company that gets slaughtered, another could be you're "Bob the Imp" (from planetdoom's comic) &amp; go on an adventure as him, one could be you walk through a teleporter &amp; end up in an "alternate universe" where the demons made teleporters &amp; marines are invading hell (as the bad guys).   Along the same lines would be an idea like the "Simpsons Spinoff Showcase" where the storys aren't all in the D3 universe.  <br /><br />Imagination is the limit.  Lots of D3 assets will be used so we won't depend on all new weapon models, code, assets, levels, etc.  We can do more creative stuff though, like make new weapons, a new baddie or two, put in more puzzle's (i really liked this about Prey).  <br /><br />Also, modders will be able to work on parts they like.  Me, for example, doesn't really want to do a super-serious mod, so me &amp; a couple other modders could work on a short story that gets kinda silly.<br /><br />A HUGE advantage I see to this type of mod is the attention span of the modders.  We won't be spending months to years on one single idea.  I feel with more variety we'll have less modders who start just disapear for no reason.<br /><br />The biggest problem I see is the coding.  If I want a weapon system that uses duel-weapons seperetly (ala "RTH") &amp; someone else wants all alt-fire, that could be a problem (i'm not a great coder so, as far as I'm concerned, if i can't figure it out i'm not doing the right thing!).  Problems along that line.</div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Jack Rammsdell wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I have several ideas, but I am not going to share them all at once.  How about doing something that almost every doom 3 mod isn't, why not make a completly non-violent mod where the player is on a quest to find his way home and encounters a variety of puzzles and task sequences.  I know it may seem boring to some people who live off violence, but it would be something that would be accepted by a large community and could be enjoyed by a larger group of people.  It would be a good opportunity to mix both real world and fantasy settings.  With settings such as a haunted castle or other strange enviroments that could be seen in a sort of riven or myst game.  </div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">vinnie_jones wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><span style="font-weight: bold">removed</span> </div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Jack Rammsdell wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">What about a Deathmatch mod with gothic, industrial, and technology based enviroments that brought in the feel of quake 3 and the looks of quake 4.  With enhanced deathmatch physics and possibly tinman's bot support.  So then mappers can go off and map their own ideas and no matter how different the style is, it would fit with the project, unless someone was to pull a funny and make a map of all bunnies and colors <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> or something along that lines.<br />How about in every story there is a key character in a dangerous situation and ultimately survives. Then each charcter is brought before the vadrigar themselves and thrown into an arena to fight, so now we are mixing the short stories, deathmatch and quake 3</div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bo$bevok wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">i say we make a doom3 game set on earth...<br /><br />if we do the short story idea we could have a chapter or level or whatever on earth</div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Jack Rammsdell wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">last saturday our town was hit with a heavy sleet that knocked the power off for a few hours. which gave me an idea for a small survival horror scenario.<br /><br />I've always wanted to do 3rd person because it was so differnt from the standard FPS games we all play. So the idea is a 3rd person survival horror mod that is based in modern time in a small town. The concept is when the power goes out the demons come. every 10 mins the town will blackout and you must try to keep a generator running to decrease the amount of time that the power is out for a better chance of survival. so you must find items such as a flashlight, weapons, fuel, food, batteries ect.. to survive the blackouts.<br /><br />There would be no need to create a whole town, just a house with a backyard and a wooden fence to keep you in.<br /><br />If thirdperson isn't possible, then it would be just as fun in firstperson, because then you would have a chance to have a more interactive enviroment and allow the player to open cabinets and drawers and all sorts of stuff to search for much needed items. </div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">mikebart wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I’ll contribute where I can but I couldn’t commit full time, I’m way too unreliable at the moment, I’ve got a few ideas for the project though, just a simple brief really im sure a few things have been said before.<br /><br />3-5 small single player showcase maps: displaying advanced modelling, texturing, lighting, physics, coding etc, each with its own theme e.g. horror, sci-fi, fantasy, modern day, stroggos.<br />In addition to each of the showcase maps we have multi player maps which follow the same theme as their single player parent but geared more towards performance rather than graphics and effects.<br />Assets from ‘both’ could be used for other ideas such as short stories and which in turn could provide assets for the single and multi player maps.<br /><br />All the textures and models used in the single player showcase maps could be rendered/projected out to simpler assets to be used in the lower poly multiplayer maps. But this doesn’t mean the multiplayer maps can’t exist until the single player maps have been started they can both be worked on in tandem providing assets for each other.</div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">6th Venom wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Do you remember about "Code Quantum" (Quantum Leap) tv serie?<br /><br />In this tv serie, a man travel in the time and become another person (the one he must help or save) the time of an episode, when he change this person destiny, don't know how or why, he is projected in the time one more time, etc...<br /><br />To keep maps linked, could make a similar thing, allowing different physical heroes, different places and times, but with a strong storyline in the back of each adventures.</div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bittoman wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">A time traveling platoon of Strogg comes to early industrial Earth.  Invading a military base they manage to blow a whole in the side of the brigg.  You are a military prisoner who escapes and ends up fending for himself while trying to battle the Strogg.  Cutting to the end you defeat the Strogg and earn a hero's medal.<br /><br />Kind of a Wolfenstein 3D with different characters.  Doom 3 seems to be extremely well suited to a dark, greasy industrial era (lighting-wise).  Would be a good setting if the adventure were set in an all night raid and would minimize the number of NPC models necessary for the mod (a little less work), mostly just needing to re-skin current player models to fit them with more modern uniforms or prison outfits.  I can see this done with a little Duke Nukem style humor too.</div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bittoman wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">It could be something done as an extension to the Doom 3 game so how about a role reversal where you're an Imp battling invading Marines?</div></div>

						<div class="postbody">I think it would be smart to start small.  By small I don't necessarily mean content but in the actual mod size.  Even more specifically the number of maps being kept to a small numbers (maybe a half dozen or less).  This would be for a "first installment".  My reasons is one of the hardest things to keep a mod group going is the interest in it, if the project can have a near and clear ending then confidence of what the team is capable of will be significantly boosted, when the project is completed confidence gets an even bigger boost.  Using that inertia the project could be expanded.  Maybe even an episodic type of adventure like the Half Life 2 episodes (on a much smaller scale).
<br /><br />Other than this I think it's also important to nail down what kind of mod would be in mind.  Should this be a multiplayer mod or a singleplayer mod?  Keeping in mind what I said above, choosing one or the other would be smart and not trying to combine the two saving that for the "next installment" maybe.  Personally I'd be interested in seeing a single player game that featured some new objects (weapons, tools, etc.) that pushes the player to be more interactive with their world as opposed to the usual "if it moves, shoot it".  This might put a bit of emphasis on the programmer or whoever's handling level scripts though.</div>

						<div class="postbody">Hey I like this idea! As you stated, it is a perfect solution for mod makers with all types of attention spans haha! Plus, it would be great for someone like myself, who is definatly interested in creating all sorts of assets, models, textures, maps you name it, but don't quite have the dedication for a full time mod, but at the same time, dont want my stuff going unused. This could really be a lot of fun.
<br /><br />I also liked your idea on having a sense of humor about it. I think mods these days are far too serious and try to be too professional, when they are truely missing the whole advantage of being modders: there is no distributor telling you what to do! You can be as edgy, wild, and crazy as you like <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />I could provide vurtually anything visual: Models, textures, texture sets, custom skyboxes... this could be fun!
<br /><br />Episodic is also key: simply releasing anything puts you a step above most other mod makers as most do not get released. Episodic releases would expedite this release.
<br /><br />nice!</div>

						<div class="postbody">I have several ideas, but I am not going to share them all at once.  How about doing something that almost every doom 3 mod isn't, why not make a completly non-violent mod where the player is on a quest to find his way home and encounters a variety of puzzles and task sequences.  I know it may seem boring to some people who live off violence, but it would be something that would be accepted by a large community and could be enjoyed by a larger group of people.  It would be a good opportunity to mix both real world and fantasy settings.  With settings such as a haunted castle or other strange enviroments that could be seen in a sort of riven or myst game.  
<br /><br />I have 3 other ideas that are all completly differnt, so I'll get them sorted out and share them another time.</div>

						<div class="postbody">speakin of ideas, i have a couple, but ill just mention one,
<br />would be cool to do a "what if" kinda story,
<br />lets say the nazzis won ww2 (not totally illogical
<br />IF the nazi leadership under Hitler had removed him from
<br />power just before that idiotic twofront idea he had
<br />about invading Soviet in 1941) and then move the timeline forward
<br />to about 2030 or similar, Mars is still Mars etc but instead of Betruger
<br />call the scientist something like Himmler the fourth,
<br />Reinhard Heydrich the third or similar, you get the drift,
<br />and then fill Mars with nazi swastika, do a couple of new
<br />levels thats kinda were unreachable in vanilla doom
<br />(theres doors that cannot be opened in vanilla d3,
<br />those new maps could be reached by those doors),
<br />all this could be a lot like RTCW i guess, but i fail to see how
<br />THAT cannot be anything but good since RTCW pwned  ; )
<br />Imagine running around in doom 3 with a MP44,
<br />MG42, stiefelhandgranaten and a flammenverfer  hehehe

						<div class="postbody">a features I love from ROE and from F.E.A.R are the slow motion  abbility
<br />that And the default walk pace is to slow for action but perfect for a terror level where you expect stuff to pop out
<br /><br />So depending on what we want
<br />If we want action
<br />Definalty need to pick up the pace
<br />if we decide on horor it can go either way
<br /><br />If we do the pop out of the walls trick like ID  then slow for sure
<br />But if we use enviroment and audio to do the trick we can pick up the pace and still instill terror
<br /><br />One of the things That was missing between this doom and the first and second was  a fast pace of action --but this one definatly creates more an atmosphere
<br /><br />I agree on the doom3 engine to much was stripped from the q4 engine in my opinion  it just dosnt look as good --maybe thats just me but I still think the original d3 looks the best</div>

						<div class="postbody">i didn't intend for this thread to critique ideas, just to post them (and perhaps more clarifying questions).
<br /><br />While I agree about the "Action is needed" stance, look at HL2.  The action there was filler between mono logs.  Yet that game still sold (honestly, i STILL don't know why).
<br /><br />re: jack's "non-violent" idea...
<br /><br />that idea DOES sound interesting (myst-like, i've had the same idea along with pbmax), the only issue I see is that the only people who would play are people who already owned D3, which is violent.  Do you think people would re-install D3 for that, or perhaps, BUY a copy of D3 for that?  (obviously if it's good enough).  That would be a killer idea for a full-fledged game though.
<br /><br />Me &amp; PBMax threw around a few ideas months ago.  One I had was a game where space-sheep are invading earth &amp; space-goats are defending it.  Pretty much you can imagine how that winds up just from the sheep &amp; goat motif.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />  Lots of cloven-betrayal in there!
<br /><br />But that's what I like about the modular/eposidic/short story based mod idea.  The whistle can be wet in different types of ideas.</div>

Do a Doom 3 mod simular to the idea behind the Simpsons episode "22 short films about springfield."  It would be short sections (eposidioc like) based around the Doom 3 universe.  The reason I like this is that stary 1 could be based around you being one of the guys from Bravo company that gets slaughtered, another could be you're "Bob the Imp" (from planetdoom's comic) &amp; go on an adventure as him, one could be you walk through a teleporter &amp; end up in an "alternate universe" where the demons made teleporters &amp; marines are invading hell (as the bad guys).   Along the same lines would be an idea like the "Simpsons Spinoff Showcase" where the storys aren't all in the D3 universe.  &#13;
<br/><br/>
Imagination is the limit.  Lots of D3 assets will be used so we won't depend on all new weapon models, code, assets, levels, etc.  We can do more creative stuff though, like make new weapons, a new baddie or two, put in more puzzle's (i really liked this about Prey).  &#13;
<br/><br/>
Also, modders will be able to work on parts they like.  Me, for example, doesn't really want to do a super-serious mod, so me &amp; a couple other modders could work on a short story that gets kinda silly.&#13;
<br/><br/>
A HUGE advantage I see to this type of mod is the attention span of the modders.  We won't be spending months to years on one single idea.  I feel with more variety we'll have less modders who start just disapear for no reason.&#13;
<br/><br/>
The biggest problem I see is the coding.  If I want a weapon system that uses duel-weapons seperetly (ala "RTH") &amp; someone else wants all alt-fire, that could be a problem (i'm not a great coder so, as far as I'm concerned, if i can't figure it out i'm not doing the right thing!).  Problems along that line.</td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody">&#13;

last saturday our town was hit with a heavy sleet that knocked the power off for a few hours. which gave me an idea for a small survival horror scenario.&#13;
<br/><br/>
I've always wanted to do 3rd person because it was so differnt from the standard FPS games we all play. So the idea is a 3rd person survival horror mod that is based in modern time in a small town. The concept is when the power goes out the demons come. every 10 mins the town will blackout and you must try to keep a generator running to decrease the amount of time that the power is out for a better chance of survival. so you must find items such as a flashlight, weapons, fuel, food, batteries ect.. to survive the blackouts.&#13;
<br/><br/>
There would be no need to create a whole town, just a house with a backyard and a wooden fence to keep you in.&#13;
<br/><br/>
If thirdperson isn't possible, then it would be just as fun in firstperson, because then you would have a chance to have a more interactive enviroment and allow the player to open cabinets and drawers and all sorts of stuff to search for much needed items. </td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody">&#13;

<br/><br/>
3-5 small single player showcase maps: displaying advanced modelling, texturing, lighting, physics, coding etc, each with its own theme e.g. horror, sci-fi, fantasy, modern day, stroggos.&#13;
<br/>
In addition to each of the showcase maps we have multi player maps which follow the same theme as their single player parent but geared more towards performance rather than graphics and effects.&#13;
<br/>
Assets from ÃâbothÃâ could be used for other ideas such as short stories and which in turn could provide assets for the single and multi player maps.&#13;
<br/><br/>
All the textures and models used in the single player showcase maps could be rendered/projected out to simpler assets to be used in the lower poly multiplayer maps. But this doesnÃât mean the multiplayer maps canÃât exist until the single player maps have been started they can both be worked on in tandem providing assets for each other.</td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody">&#13;

To keep maps linked, could make a similar thing, allowing different physical heroes, different places and times, but with a strong storyline in the back of each adventures.</td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody">&#13;

<br/><br/>
Kind of a Wolfenstein 3D with different characters.  Doom 3 seems to be extremely well suited to a dark, greasy industrial era (lighting-wise).  Would be a good setting if the adventure were set in an all night raid and would minimize the number of NPC models necessary for the mod (a little less work), mostly just needing to re-skin current player models to fit them with more modern uniforms or prison outfits.  I can see this done with a little Duke Nukem style humor too.</td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody">&#13;

By small I don't necessarily mean content but in the actual mod size.  Even more specifically the number of maps being kept to a small numbers (maybe a half dozen or less).  This would be for a "first installment".  My reasons is one of the hardest things to keep a mod group going is the interest in it, if the project can have a near and clear ending then confidence of what the team is capable of will be significantly boosted, when the project is completed confidence gets an even bigger boost.  Using that inertia the project could be expanded.  Maybe even an episodic type of adventure like the Half Life 2 episodes (on a much smaller scale).&#13;
<br/><br/>
Other than this I think it's also important to nail down what kind of mod would be in mind.  Should this be a multiplayer mod or a singleplayer mod?  Keeping in mind what I said above, choosing one or the other would be smart and not trying to combine the two saving that for the "next installment" maybe.  Personally I'd be interested in seeing a single player game that featured some new objects (weapons, tools, etc.) that pushes the player to be more interactive with their world as opposed to the usual "if it moves, shoot it".  This might put a bit of emphasis on the programmer or whoever's handling level scripts though.</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

As you stated, it is a perfect solution for mod makers with all types of attention spans haha! Plus, it would be great for someone like myself, who is definatly interested in creating all sorts of assets, models, textures, maps you name it, but don't quite have the dedication for a full time mod, but at the same time, dont want my stuff going unused. This could really be a lot of fun.&#13;
<br/><br/>
I also liked your idea on having a sense of humor about it. I think mods these days are far too serious and try to be too professional, when they are truely missing the whole advantage of being modders: there is no distributor telling you what to do! You can be as edgy, wild, and crazy as you like <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0"/><br/><br/>
I could provide vurtually anything visual: Models, textures, texture sets, custom skyboxes... this could be fun!&#13;
<br/><br/>
Episodic is also key: simply releasing anything puts you a step above most other mod makers as most do not get released. Episodic releases would expedite this release.&#13;
<br/><br/>

would be cool to do a "what if" kinda story,&#13;

lets say the nazzis won ww2 (not totally illogical&#13;
<br/>
IF the nazi leadership under Hitler had removed him from&#13;
<br/>
power just before that idiotic twofront idea he had&#13;
<br/>
about invading Soviet in 1941) and then move the timeline forward&#13;
<br/>
to about 2030 or similar, Mars is still Mars etc but instead of Betruger&#13;
<br/>
call the scientist something like Himmler the fourth,&#13;
<br/>
Reinhard Heydrich the third or similar, you get the drift,&#13;
<br/>
and then fill Mars with nazi swastika, do a couple of new&#13;
<br/>
levels thats kinda were unreachable in vanilla doom&#13;
<br/>
(theres doors that cannot be opened in vanilla d3,&#13;
<br/>
those new maps could be reached by those doors),&#13;
<br/>
all this could be a lot like RTCW i guess, but i fail to see how&#13;
<br/>
THAT cannot be anything but good since RTCW pwned  ; )&#13;

<br/><br/>
While I agree about the "Action is needed" stance, look at HL2.  The action there was filler between mono logs.  Yet that game still sold (honestly, i STILL don't know why).&#13;
<br/><br/>
re: jack's "non-violent" idea...&#13;
<br/><br/>
that idea DOES sound interesting (myst-like, i've had the same idea along with pbmax), the only issue I see is that the only people who would play are people who already owned D3, which is violent.  Do you think people would re-install D3 for that, or perhaps, BUY a copy of D3 for that?  (obviously if it's good enough).  That would be a killer idea for a full-fledged game though.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Me &amp; PBMax threw around a few ideas months ago.  One I had was a game where space-sheep are invading earth &amp; space-goats are defending it.  Pretty much you can imagine how that winds up just from the sheep &amp; goat motif.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0"/>  Lots of cloven-betrayal in there!&#13;
<br/><br/>
But that's what I like about the modular/eposidic/short story based mod idea.  The whistle can be wet in different types of ideas

<br /><br />While I agree about the "Action is needed" stance, look at HL2.  The action there was filler between mono logs.  Yet that game still sold (honestly, i STILL don't know why).
<br /><br />re: jack's "non-violent" idea...
<br /><br />that idea DOES sound interesting (myst-like, i've had the same idea along with pbmax), the only issue I see is that the only people who would play are people who already owned D3, which is violent.  Do you think people would re-install D3 for that, or perhaps, BUY a copy of D3 for that?  (obviously if it's good enough).  That would be a killer idea for a full-fledged game though.
<br /><br />Me &amp; PBMax threw around a few ideas months ago.  One I had was a game where space-sheep are invading earth &amp; space-goats are defending it.  Pretty much you can imagine how that winds up just from the sheep &amp; goat motif.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />  Lots of cloven-betrayal in there!

<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">IDEAS: </span></span>
<br /><div class="quotetitle">The Happy Friar off original idea by Dinky wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Do a Doom 3 mod simular to the idea behind the Simpsons episode "22 short films about springfield."  It would be short sections (eposidioc like) based around the Doom 3 universe.  The reason I like this is that stary 1 could be based around you being one of the guys from Bravo company that gets slaughtered, another could be you're "Bob the Imp" (from planetdoom's comic) &amp; go on an adventure as him, one could be you walk through a teleporter &amp; end up in an "alternate universe" where the demons made teleporters &amp; marines are invading hell (as the bad guys).   Along the same lines would be an idea like the "Simpsons Spinoff Showcase" where the storys aren't all in the D3 universe.  <br /><br />Imagination is the limit.  Lots of D3 assets will be used so we won't depend on all new weapon models, code, assets, levels, etc.  We can do more creative stuff though, like make new weapons, a new baddie or two, put in more puzzle's (i really liked this about Prey).  <br /><br />Also, modders will be able to work on parts they like.  Me, for example, doesn't really want to do a super-serious mod, so me &amp; a couple other modders could work on a short story that gets kinda silly.<br /><br />A HUGE advantage I see to this type of mod is the attention span of the modders.  We won't be spending months to years on one single idea.  I feel with more variety we'll have less modders who start just disapear for no reason.<br /><br />The biggest problem I see is the coding.  If I want a weapon system that uses duel-weapons seperetly (ala "RTH") &amp; someone else wants all alt-fire, that could be a problem (i'm not a great coder so, as far as I'm concerned, if i can't figure it out i'm not doing the right thing!).

It would be short sections (eposidioc like) based around the Doom 3 universe.  The reason I like this is that stary 1 could be based around you being one of the guys from Bravo company that gets slaughtered, another could be you're "Bob the Imp" (from planetdoom's comic) &amp; go on an adventure as him, one could be you walk through a teleporter &amp; end up in an "alternate universe" where the demons made teleporters &amp; marines are invading hell (as the bad guys).   Along the same lines would be an idea like the "Simpsons Spinoff Showcase" where the storys aren't all in the D3 universe.  <br /><br />Imagination is the limit.  Lots of D3 assets will be used so we won't depend on all new weapon models, code, assets, levels, etc.  We can do more creative stuff though, like make new weapons, a new baddie or two, put in more puzzle's (i really liked this about Prey).  <br /><br />Also, modders will be able to work on parts they like.  Me, for example, doesn't really want to do a super-serious mod, so me &amp; a couple other modders could work on a short story that gets kinda silly.<br /><br />A HUGE advantage I see to this type of mod is the attention span of the modders.  We won't be spending months to years on one single idea.  I feel with more variety we'll have less modders who start just disapear for no reason.<br /><br />The biggest problem I see is the coding.  If I want a weapon system that uses duel-weapons seperetly (ala "RTH") &amp; someone else wants all alt-fire, that could be a problem (i'm not a great coder so, as far as I'm concerned, if i can't figure it out i'm not doing the right thing!).

So the idea is a 3rd person survival horror mod that is based in modern time in a small town. The concept is when the power goes out the demons come. every 10 mins the town will blackout and you must try to keep a generator running to decrease the amount of time that the power is out for a better chance of survival. so you must find items such as a flashlight, weapons, fuel, food, batteries ect.. to survive the blackouts.<br /><br />There would be no need to create a whole town, just a house with a backyard and a wooden fence to keep you in.<br /><br />If thirdperson isn't possible, then it would be just as fun in firstperson, because then you would have a chance to have a more interactive enviroment and allow the player to open cabinets and drawers and all sorts of stuff to search for much needed items. </div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">mikebart wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I’ll contribute where I can but I couldn’t commit full time, I’m way too unreliable at the moment, I’ve got a few ideas for the project though, just a simple brief really im sure a few things have been said before.<br /><br />3-5 small single player showcase maps: displaying advanced modelling, texturing, lighting, physics, coding etc, each with its own theme e.g. horror, sci-fi, fantasy, modern day, stroggos.<br />In addition to each of the showcase maps we have multi player maps which follow the same theme as their single player parent but geared more towards performance rather than graphics and effects.<br />Assets from ‘both’ could be used for other ideas such as short stories and which in turn could provide assets for the single and multi player maps.<br /><br />All the textures and models used in the single player showcase maps could be rendered/projected out to simpler assets to be used in the lower poly multiplayer maps. But this doesn’t mean the multiplayer maps can’t exist until the single player maps have been started they can both be worked on in tandem providing assets for each other.</div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">6th Venom wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Do you remember about "Code Quantum" (Quantum Leap) tv serie?<br /><br />In this tv serie, a man travel in the time and become another person (the one he must help or save) the time of an episode, when he change this person destiny, don't know how or why, he is projected in the time one more time, etc...<br /><br />To keep maps linked, could make a similar thing, allowing different physical heroes, different places and times, but with a strong storyline in the back of each adventures.</div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bittoman wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">A time traveling platoon of Strogg comes to early industrial Earth.

Doom 3 seems to be extremely well suited to a dark, greasy industrial era (lighting-wise).  Would be a good setting if the adventure were set in an all night raid and would minimize the number of NPC models necessary for the mod (a little less work), mostly just needing to re-skin current player models to fit them with more modern uniforms or prison outfits.

By small I don't necessarily mean content but in the actual mod size.  Even more specifically the number of maps being kept to a small numbers (maybe a half dozen or less).  This would be for a "first installment".  My reasons is one of the hardest things to keep a mod group going is the interest in it, if the project can have a near and clear ending then confidence of what the team is capable of will be significantly boosted, when the project is completed confidence gets an even bigger boost.  Using that inertia the project could be expanded.  Maybe even an episodic type of adventure like the Half Life 2 episodes (on a much smaller scale).
<br /><br />Other than this I think it's also important to nail down what kind of mod would be in mind.  Should this be a multiplayer mod or a singleplayer mod?  Keeping in mind what I said above, choosing one or the other would be smart and not trying to combine the two saving that for the "next installment" maybe.  Personally I'd be interested in seeing a single player game that featured some new objects (weapons, tools, etc.) that pushes the player to be more interactive with their world as opposed to the usual "if it moves, shoot it".  This might put a bit of emphasis on the programmer or whoever's handling level scripts though.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p171486" date="Posted: Sun Feb 25, 2007 2:32 am "><author>voldemort</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Well I would just like to say this I do mapping but layout is my downfall once blocked out and rough detailed --I like to go insane on detail items --so long as they dont affect fram rate that is Just figured I would share that since its my only real strength --preaty lame I know <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p171492" date="Posted: Sun Feb 25, 2007 3:44 am "><author>nbrancaccio</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Hey I like this idea! As you stated, it is a perfect solution for mod makers with all types of attention spans haha! Plus, it would be great for someone like myself, who is definatly interested in creating all sorts of assets, models, textures, maps you name it, but don't quite have the dedication for a full time mod, but at the same time, dont want my stuff going unused. This could really be a lot of fun.
<br /><br />I also liked your idea on having a sense of humor about it. I think mods these days are far too serious and try to be too professional, when they are truely missing the whole advantage of being modders: there is no distributor telling you what to do! You can be as edgy, wild, and crazy as you like <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />I could provide vurtually anything visual: Models, textures, texture sets, custom skyboxes... this could be fun!
<br /><br />Episodic is also key: simply releasing anything puts you a step above most other mod makers as most do not get released. Episodic releases would expedite this release.

Along the same lines would be an idea like the "Simpsons Spinoff Showcase" where the storys aren't all in the D3 universe.  <br /><br />Imagination is the limit.  Lots of D3 assets will be used so we won't depend on all new weapon models, code, assets, levels, etc.  We can do more creative stuff though, like make new weapons, a new baddie or two, put in more puzzle's (i really liked this about Prey).  <br /><br />Also, modders will be able to work on parts they like.  Me, for example, doesn't really want to do a super-serious mod, so me &amp; a couple other modders could work on a short story that gets kinda silly.<br /><br />A HUGE advantage I see to this type of mod is the attention span of the modders.  We won't be spending months to years on one single idea.  I feel with more variety we'll have less modders who start just disapear for no reason.<br /><br />The biggest problem I see is the coding.  If I want a weapon system that uses duel-weapons seperetly (ala "RTH") &amp; someone else wants all alt-fire, that could be a problem (i'm not a great coder so, as far as I'm concerned, if i can't figure it out i'm not doing the right thing!).  Problems along that line.</div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Jack Rammsdell wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I have several ideas, but I am not going to share them all at once.

By small I don't necessarily mean content but in the actual mod size.  Even more specifically the number of maps being kept to a small numbers (maybe a half dozen or less).  This would be for a "first installment".  My reasons is one of the hardest things to keep a mod group going is the interest in it, if the project can have a near and clear ending then confidence of what the team is capable of will be significantly boosted, when the project is completed confidence gets an even bigger boost.  Using that inertia the project could be expanded.  Maybe even an episodic type of adventure like the Half Life 2 episodes (on a much smaller scale).
<br /><br />Other than this I think it's also important to nail down what kind of mod would be in mind.  Should this be a multiplayer mod or a singleplayer mod?  Keeping in mind what I said above, choosing one or the other would be smart and not trying to combine the two saving that for the "next installment" maybe.  Personally I'd be interested in seeing a single player game that featured some new objects (weapons, tools, etc.) that pushes the player to be more interactive with their world as opposed to the usual "if it moves, shoot it".  This might put a bit of emphasis on the programmer or whoever's handling level scripts though.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p171486" date="Posted: Sun Feb 25, 2007 2:32 am "><author>voldemort</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Well I would just like to say this I do mapping but layout is my downfall once blocked out and rough detailed --I like to go insane on detail items --so long as they dont affect fram rate that is Just figured I would share that since its my only real strength --preaty lame I know <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p171492" date="Posted: Sun Feb 25, 2007 3:44 am "><author>nbrancaccio</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Hey I like this idea! As you stated, it is a perfect solution for mod makers with all types of attention spans haha! Plus, it would be great for someone like myself, who is definatly interested in creating all sorts of assets, models, textures, maps you name it, but don't quite have the dedication for a full time mod, but at the same time, dont want my stuff going unused. This could really be a lot of fun.
<br /><br />I also liked your idea on having a sense of humor about it. I think mods these days are far too serious and try to be too professional, when they are truely missing the whole advantage of being modders: there is no distributor telling you what to do! You can be as edgy, wild, and crazy as you like <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />I could provide vurtually anything visual: Models, textures, texture sets, custom skyboxes... this could be fun!
<br /><br />Episodic is also key: simply releasing anything puts you a step above most other mod makers as most do not get released. Episodic releases would expedite this release.
<br /><br />nice!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p171500" date="Posted: Sun Feb 25, 2007 6:14 am "><author>Jack Rammsdell</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I have several ideas, but I am not going to share them all at once.

<br />would be cool to do a "what if" kinda story,
<br />lets say the nazzis won ww2 (not totally illogical
<br />IF the nazi leadership under Hitler had removed him from
<br />power just before that idiotic twofront idea he had
<br />about invading Soviet in 1941) and then move the timeline forward
<br />to about 2030 or similar, Mars is still Mars etc but instead of Betruger
<br />call the scientist something like Himmler the fourth,
<br />Reinhard Heydrich the third or similar, you get the drift,
<br />and then fill Mars with nazi swastika, do a couple of new
<br />levels thats kinda were unreachable in vanilla doom
<br />(theres doors that cannot be opened in vanilla d3,
<br />those new maps could be reached by those doors),
<br />all this could be a lot like RTCW i guess, but i fail to see how
<br />THAT cannot be anything but good since RTCW pwned  ; )
<br />Imagine running around in doom 3 with a MP44,
<br />MG42, stiefelhandgranaten and a flammenverfer  hehehe

<br />If we want action
<br />Definalty need to pick up the pace
<br />if we decide on horor it can go either way
<br /><br />If we do the pop out of the walls trick like ID  then slow for sure
<br />But if we use enviroment and audio to do the trick we can pick up the pace and still instill terror
<br /><br />One of the things That was missing between this doom and the first and second was  a fast pace of action --but this one definatly creates more an atmosphere

<br /><br />While I agree about the "Action is needed" stance, look at HL2.  The action there was filler between mono logs.  Yet that game still sold (honestly, i STILL don't know why).
<br /><br />re: jack's "non-violent" idea...
<br /><br />that idea DOES sound interesting (myst-like, i've had the same idea along with pbmax), the only issue I see is that the only people who would play are people who already owned D3, which is violent.  Do you think people would re-install D3 for that, or perhaps, BUY a copy of D3 for that?  (obviously if it's good enough).  That would be a killer idea for a full-fledged game though.
<br /><br />Me &amp; PBMax threw around a few ideas months ago.  One I had was a game where space-sheep are invading earth &amp; space-goats are defending it.  Pretty much you can imagine how that winds up just from the sheep &amp; goat motif.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />  Lots of cloven-betrayal in there!

This might put a bit of emphasis on the programmer or whoever's handling level scripts though.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p171486" date="Posted: Sun Feb 25, 2007 2:32 am "><author>voldemort</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Well I would just like to say this I do mapping but layout is my downfall once blocked out and rough detailed --I like to go insane on detail items --so long as they dont affect fram rate that is Just figured I would share that since its my only real strength --preaty lame I know <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p171492" date="Posted: Sun Feb 25, 2007 3:44 am "><author>nbrancaccio</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Hey I like this idea! As you stated, it is a perfect solution for mod makers with all types of attention spans haha! Plus, it would be great for someone like myself, who is definatly interested in creating all sorts of assets, models, textures, maps you name it, but don't quite have the dedication for a full time mod, but at the same time, dont want my stuff going unused. This could really be a lot of fun.&#13;<br /><br />I also liked your idea on having a sense of humor about it. I think mods these days are far too serious and try to be too professional, when they are truely missing the whole advantage of being modders: there is no distributor telling you what to do! You can be as edgy, wild, and crazy as you like <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />I could provide vurtually anything visual: Models, textures, texture sets, custom skyboxes... this could be fun!&#13;<br /><br />Episodic is also key: simply releasing anything puts you a step above most other mod makers as most do not get released. Episodic releases would expedite this release.&#13;<br /><br />nice!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p171500" date="Posted: Sun Feb 25, 2007 6:14 am "><author>Jack Rammsdell</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I have several ideas, but I am not going to share them all at once.  How about doing something that almost every doom 3 mod isn't, why not make a completly non-violent mod where the player is on a quest to find his way home and encounters a variety of puzzles and task sequences.  I know it may seem boring to some people who live off violence, but it would be something that would be accepted by a large community and could be enjoyed by a larger group of people.  It would be a good opportunity to mix both real world and fantasy settings.  With settings such as a haunted castle or other strange enviroments that could be seen in a sort of riven or myst game.  &#13;<br /><br />I have 3 other ideas that are all completly differnt, so I'll get them sorted out and share them another time.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p171569" date="Posted: Mon Feb 26, 2007 2:43 am "><author>vinnie_jones</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">speakin of ideas, i have a couple, but ill just mention one,&#13;<br />would be cool to do a "what if" kinda story,&#13;<br />lets say the nazzis won ww2 (not totally illogical&#13;<br />IF the nazi leadership under Hitler had removed him from&#13;<br />power just before that idiotic twofront idea he had&#13;<br />about invading Soviet in 1941) and then move the timeline forward&#13;<br />to about 2030 or similar, Mars is still Mars etc but instead of Betruger&#13;<br />call the scientist something like Himmler the fourth,&#13;<br />Reinhard Heydrich the third or similar, you get the drift,&#13;<br />and then fill Mars with nazi swastika, do a couple of new&#13;<br />levels thats kinda were unreachable in vanilla doom&#13;<br />(theres doors that cannot be opened in vanilla d3,&#13;<br />those new maps could be reached by those doors),&#13;<br />all this could be a lot like RTCW i guess, but i fail to see how&#13;<br />THAT cannot be anything but good since RTCW pwned  ; )&#13;<br />Imagine running around in doom 3 with a MP44,&#13;<br />MG42, stiefelhandgranaten and a flammenverfer  hehehe  &#13;<br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />If i was a scripter/modder, id def do something like this !  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p171573" date="Posted: Mon Feb 26, 2007 3:16 am "><author>voldemort</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">a features I love from ROE and from F.E.A.R are the slow motion  abbility&#13;<br />that And the default walk pace is to slow for action but perfect for a terror level where you expect stuff to pop out&#13;<br /><br />So depending on what we want&#13;<br />If we want action&#13;<br />Definalty need to pick up the pace&#13;<br />if we decide on horor it can go either way&#13;<br /><br />If we do the pop out of the walls trick like ID  then slow for sure&#13;<br />But if we use enviroment and audio to do the trick we can pick up the pace and still instill terror&#13;<br /><br />One of the things That was missing between this doom and the first and second was  a fast pace of action --but this one definatly creates more an atmosphere&#13;<br /><br />I agree on the doom3 engine to much was stripped from the q4 engine in my opinion  it just dosnt look as good --maybe thats just me but I still think the original d3 looks the best</div>]]></body></post><post id="p171575" date="Posted: Mon Feb 26, 2007 3:40 am "><author>Jack Rammsdell</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">In my opinion, action is the only way to go, to get everyones interest, I didn't like doom 3 in some parts because it was slow and you could always expect somone to pop out of left field.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p171580" date="Posted: Mon Feb 26, 2007 4:43 am "><author>The Happy Friar</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">i didn't intend for this thread to critique ideas, just to post them (and perhaps more clarifying questions).&#13;<br /><br />While I agree about the "Action is needed" stance, look at HL2.  The action there was filler between mono logs.  Yet that game still sold (honestly, i STILL don't know why).&#13;<br /><br />re: jack's "non-violent" idea...&#13;<br /><br />that idea DOES sound interesting (myst-like, i've had the same idea along with pbmax), the only issue I see is that the only people who would play are people who already owned D3, which is violent.  Do you think people would re-install D3 for that, or perhaps, BUY a copy of D3 for that?  (obviously if it's good enough).  That would be a killer idea for a full-fledged game though.&#13;<br /><br />Me &amp; PBMax threw around a few ideas months ago.  One I had was a game where space-sheep are invading earth &amp; space-goats are defending it.  Pretty much you can imagine how that winds up just from the sheep &amp; goat motif.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />  Lots of cloven-betrayal in there!&#13;<br /><br />But that's what I like about the modular/eposidic/short story based mod idea.

						<div class="postbody">referencing <a href="viewtopic.php?t=18836" class="postlink">the Mod Idea Thread</a>, lets think of idea for the mod.  People throw out your ideas (don't forget that, odds are, amatures will be working on this to so don't except "RTH" or "Dark Mod" quality.  Just HOPE it!).  iI'm imagining something closer to "Duck Nukem" quality (being realistic here!)  iThen we'll vote.&#13;<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">IDEAS: </span></span>&#13;<br /><div class="quotetitle">The Happy Friar off original idea by Dinky wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Do a Doom 3 mod simular to the idea behind the Simpsons episode "22 short films about springfield."  It would be short sections (eposidioc like) based around the Doom 3 universe.  The reason I like this is that stary 1 could be based around you being one of the guys from Bravo company that gets slaughtered, another could be you're "Bob the Imp" (from planetdoom's comic) &amp; go on an adventure as him, one could be you walk through a teleporter &amp; end up in an "alternate universe" where the demons made teleporters &amp; marines are invading hell (as the bad guys).   Along the same lines would be an idea like the "Simpsons Spinoff Showcase" where the storys aren't all in the D3 universe.  <br /><br />Imagination is the limit.  Lots of D3 assets will be used so we won't depend on all new weapon models, code, assets, levels, etc.  We can do more creative stuff though, like make new weapons, a new baddie or two, put in more puzzle's (i really liked this about Prey).  <br /><br />Also, modders will be able to work on parts they like.  Me, for example, doesn't really want to do a super-serious mod, so me &amp; a couple other modders could work on a short story that gets kinda silly.<br /><br />A HUGE advantage I see to this type of mod is the attention span of the modders.  We won't be spending months to years on one single idea.  I feel with more variety we'll have less modders who start just disapear for no reason.<br /><br />The biggest problem I see is the coding.  If I want a weapon system that uses duel-weapons seperetly (ala "RTH") &amp; someone else wants all alt-fire, that could be a problem (i'm not a great coder so, as far as I'm concerned, if i can't figure it out i'm not doing the right thing!).  Problems along that line.</div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Jack Rammsdell wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I have several ideas, but I am not going to share them all at once.  How about doing something that almost every doom 3 mod isn't, why not make a completly non-violent mod where the player is on a quest to find his way home and encounters a variety of puzzles and task sequences.  I know it may seem boring to some people who live off violence, but it would be something that would be accepted by a large community and could be enjoyed by a larger group of people.  It would be a good opportunity to mix both real world and fantasy settings.  With settings such as a haunted castle or other strange enviroments that could be seen in a sort of riven or myst game.  </div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">vinnie_jones wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><span style="font-weight: bold">removed</span> </div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Jack Rammsdell wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">What about a Deathmatch mod with gothic, industrial, and technology based enviroments that brought in the feel of quake 3 and the looks of quake 4.  With enhanced deathmatch physics and possibly tinman's bot support.  So then mappers can go off and map their own ideas and no matter how different the style is, it would fit with the project, unless someone was to pull a funny and make a map of all bunnies and colors <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> or something along that lines.<br />How about in every story there is a key character in a dangerous situation and ultimately survives. Then each charcter is brought before the vadrigar themselves and thrown into an arena to fight, so now we are mixing the short stories, deathmatch and quake 3</div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bo$bevok wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">i say we make a doom3 game set on earth...<br /><br />if we do the short story idea we could have a chapter or level or whatever on earth</div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Jack Rammsdell wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">last saturday our town was hit with a heavy sleet that knocked the power off for a few hours. which gave me an idea for a small survival horror scenario.<br /><br />I've always wanted to do 3rd person because it was so differnt from the standard FPS games we all play. So the idea is a 3rd person survival horror mod that is based in modern time in a small town. The concept is when the power goes out the demons come. every 10 mins the town will blackout and you must try to keep a generator running to decrease the amount of time that the power is out for a better chance of survival. so you must find items such as a flashlight, weapons, fuel, food, batteries ect.. to survive the blackouts.<br /><br />There would be no need to create a whole town, just a house with a backyard and a wooden fence to keep you in.<br /><br />If thirdperson isn't possible, then it would be just as fun in firstperson, because then you would have a chance to have a more interactive enviroment and allow the player to open cabinets and drawers and all sorts of stuff to search for much needed items. </div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">mikebart wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I’ll contribute where I can but I couldn’t commit full time, I’m way too unreliable at the moment, I’ve got a few ideas for the project though, just a simple brief really im sure a few things have been said before.<br /><br />3-5 small single player showcase maps: displaying advanced modelling, texturing, lighting, physics, coding etc, each with its own theme e.g. horror, sci-fi, fantasy, modern day, stroggos.<br />In addition to each of the showcase maps we have multi player maps which follow the same theme as their single player parent but geared more towards performance rather than graphics and effects.<br />Assets from ‘both’ could be used for other ideas such as short stories and which in turn could provide assets for the single and multi player maps.<br /><br />All the textures and models used in the single player showcase maps could be rendered/projected out to simpler assets to be used in the lower poly multiplayer maps. But this doesn’t mean the multiplayer maps can’t exist until the single player maps have been started they can both be worked on in tandem providing assets for each other.</div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">6th Venom wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Do you remember about "Code Quantum" (Quantum Leap) tv serie?<br /><br />In this tv serie, a man travel in the time and become another person (the one he must help or save) the time of an episode, when he change this person destiny, don't know how or why, he is projected in the time one more time, etc...<br /><br />To keep maps linked, could make a similar thing, allowing different physical heroes, different places and times, but with a strong storyline in the back of each adventures.</div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bittoman wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">A time traveling platoon of Strogg comes to early industrial Earth.  Invading a military base they manage to blow a whole in the side of the brigg.  You are a military prisoner who escapes and ends up fending for himself while trying to battle the Strogg.  Cutting to the end you defeat the Strogg and earn a hero's medal.<br /><br />Kind of a Wolfenstein 3D with different characters.  Doom 3 seems to be extremely well suited to a dark, greasy industrial era (lighting-wise).  Would be a good setting if the adventure were set in an all night raid and would minimize the number of NPC models necessary for the mod (a little less work), mostly just needing to re-skin current player models to fit them with more modern uniforms or prison outfits.  I can see this done with a little Duke Nukem style humor too.</div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bittoman wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">It could be something done as an extension to the Doom 3 game so how about a role reversal where you're an Imp battling invading Marines?</div></div>

						<div class="postbody">I think it would be smart to start small.  By small I don't necessarily mean content but in the actual mod size.  Even more specifically the number of maps being kept to a small numbers (maybe a half dozen or less).  This would be for a "first installment".  My reasons is one of the hardest things to keep a mod group going is the interest in it, if the project can have a near and clear ending then confidence of what the team is capable of will be significantly boosted, when the project is completed confidence gets an even bigger boost.  Using that inertia the project could be expanded.  Maybe even an episodic type of adventure like the Half Life 2 episodes (on a much smaller scale).&#13;<br /><br />Other than this I think it's also important to nail down what kind of mod would be in mind.  Should this be a multiplayer mod or a singleplayer mod?  Keeping in mind what I said above, choosing one or the other would be smart and not trying to combine the two saving that for the "next installment" maybe.  Personally I'd be interested in seeing a single player game that featured some new objects (weapons, tools, etc.) that pushes the player to be more interactive with their world as opposed to the usual "if it moves, shoot it".  This might put a bit of emphasis on the programmer or whoever's handling level scripts though.</div>

						<div class="postbody">Hey I like this idea! As you stated, it is a perfect solution for mod makers with all types of attention spans haha! Plus, it would be great for someone like myself, who is definatly interested in creating all sorts of assets, models, textures, maps you name it, but don't quite have the dedication for a full time mod, but at the same time, dont want my stuff going unused. This could really be a lot of fun.&#13;<br /><br />I also liked your idea on having a sense of humor about it. I think mods these days are far too serious and try to be too professional, when they are truely missing the whole advantage of being modders: there is no distributor telling you what to do! You can be as edgy, wild, and crazy as you like <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />I could provide vurtually anything visual: Models, textures, texture sets, custom skyboxes... this could be fun!&#13;<br /><br />Episodic is also key: simply releasing anything puts you a step above most other mod makers as most do not get released. Episodic releases would expedite this release.&#13;<br /><br />nice!</div>

						<div class="postbody">I have several ideas, but I am not going to share them all at once.  How about doing something that almost every doom 3 mod isn't, why not make a completly non-violent mod where the player is on a quest to find his way home and encounters a variety of puzzles and task sequences.  I know it may seem boring to some people who live off violence, but it would be something that would be accepted by a large community and could be enjoyed by a larger group of people.  It would be a good opportunity to mix both real world and fantasy settings.  With settings such as a haunted castle or other strange enviroments that could be seen in a sort of riven or myst game.  &#13;<br /><br />I have 3 other ideas that are all completly differnt, so I'll get them sorted out and share them another time.</div>

						<div class="postbody">i didn't intend for this thread to critique ideas, just to post them (and perhaps more clarifying questions).&#13;<br /><br />While I agree about the "Action is needed" stance, look at HL2.  The action there was filler between mono logs.  Yet that game still sold (honestly, i STILL don't know why).&#13;<br /><br />re: jack's "non-violent" idea...&#13;<br /><br />that idea DOES sound interesting (myst-like, i've had the same idea along with pbmax), the only issue I see is that the only people who would play are people who already owned D3, which is violent.  Do you think people would re-install D3 for that, or perhaps, BUY a copy of D3 for that?  (obviously if it's good enough).  That would be a killer idea for a full-fledged game though.&#13;<br /><br />Me &amp; PBMax threw around a few ideas months ago.  One I had was a game where space-sheep are invading earth &amp; space-goats are defending it.  Pretty much you can imagine how that winds up just from the sheep &amp; goat motif.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />  Lots of cloven-betrayal in there!&#13;<br /><br />But that's what I like about the modular/eposidic/short story based mod idea.  The whistle can be wet in different types of ideas.</div>

People throw out your ideas (don't forget that, odds are, amatures will be working on this to so don't except "RTH" or "Dark Mod" quality.  Just HOPE it!).  iI'm imagining something closer to "Duck Nukem" quality (being realistic here!)  iThen we'll vote.
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">IDEAS: </span></span>
<br /><div class="quotetitle">The Happy Friar off original idea by Dinky wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Do a Doom 3 mod simular to the idea behind the Simpsons episode "22 short films about springfield."  It would be short sections (eposidioc like) based around the Doom 3 universe.  The reason I like this is that stary 1 could be based around you being one of the guys from Bravo company that gets slaughtered, another could be you're "Bob the Imp" (from planetdoom's comic) &amp; go on an adventure as him, one could be you walk through a teleporter &amp; end up in an "alternate universe" where the demons made teleporters &amp; marines are invading hell (as the bad guys).   Along the same lines would be an idea like the "Simpsons Spinoff Showcase" where the storys aren't all in the D3 universe.  <br /><br />Imagination is the limit.  Lots of D3 assets will be used so we won't depend on all new weapon models, code, assets, levels, etc.  We can do more creative stuff though, like make new weapons, a new baddie or two, put in more puzzle's (i really liked this about Prey).  <br /><br />Also, modders will be able to work on parts they like.  Me, for example, doesn't really want to do a super-serious mod, so me &amp; a couple other modders could work on a short story that gets kinda silly.<br /><br />A HUGE advantage I see to this type of mod is the attention span of the modders.  We won't be spending months to years on one single idea.  I feel with more variety we'll have less modders who start just disapear for no reason.<br /><br />The biggest problem I see is the coding.  If I want a weapon system that uses duel-weapons seperetly (ala "RTH") &amp; someone else wants all alt-fire, that could be a problem (i'm not a great coder so, as far as I'm concerned, if i can't figure it out i'm not doing the right thing!).  Problems along that line.</div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Jack Rammsdell wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I have several ideas, but I am not going to share them all at once.

I know it may seem boring to some people who live off violence, but it would be something that would be accepted by a large community and could be enjoyed by a larger group of people.  It would be a good opportunity to mix both real world and fantasy settings.  With settings such as a haunted castle or other strange enviroments that could be seen in a sort of riven or myst game.  </div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">vinnie_jones wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><span style="font-weight: bold">removed</span> </div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Jack Rammsdell wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">What about a Deathmatch mod with gothic, industrial, and technology based enviroments that brought in the feel of quake 3 and the looks of quake 4.  With enhanced deathmatch physics and possibly tinman's bot support.  So then mappers can go off and map their own ideas and no matter how different the style is, it would fit with the project, unless someone was to pull a funny and make a map of all bunnies and colors <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> or something along that lines.<br />How about in every story there is a key character in a dangerous situation and ultimately survives. Then each charcter is brought before the vadrigar themselves and thrown into an arena to fight, so now we are mixing the short stories, deathmatch and quake 3</div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bo$bevok wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">i say we make a doom3 game set on earth...<br /><br />if we do the short story idea we could have a chapter or level or whatever on earth</div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Jack Rammsdell wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">last saturday our town was hit with a heavy sleet that knocked the power off for a few hours. which gave me an idea for a small survival horror scenario.<br /><br />I've always wanted to do 3rd person because it was so differnt from the standard FPS games we all play. So the idea is a 3rd person survival horror mod that is based in modern time in a small town. The concept is when the power goes out the demons come. every 10 mins the town will blackout and you must try to keep a generator running to decrease the amount of time that the power is out for a better chance of survival. so you must find items such as a flashlight, weapons, fuel, food, batteries ect.. to survive the blackouts.<br /><br />There would be no need to create a whole town, just a house with a backyard and a wooden fence to keep you in.<br /><br />If thirdperson isn't possible, then it would be just as fun in firstperson, because then you would have a chance to have a more interactive enviroment and allow the player to open cabinets and drawers and all sorts of stuff to search for much needed items. </div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">mikebart wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I’ll contribute where I can but I couldn’t commit full time, I’m way too unreliable at the moment, I’ve got a few ideas for the project though, just a simple brief really im sure a few things have been said before.<br /><br />3-5 small single player showcase maps: displaying advanced modelling, texturing, lighting, physics, coding etc, each with its own theme e.g. horror, sci-fi, fantasy, modern day, stroggos.<br />In addition to each of the showcase maps we have multi player maps which follow the same theme as their single player parent but geared more towards performance rather than graphics and effects.<br />Assets from ‘both’ could be used for other ideas such as short stories and which in turn could provide assets for the single and multi player maps.<br /><br />All the textures and models used in the single player showcase maps could be rendered/projected out to simpler assets to be used in the lower poly multiplayer maps. But this doesn’t mean the multiplayer maps can’t exist until the single player maps have been started they can both be worked on in tandem providing assets for each other.</div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">6th Venom wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Do you remember about "Code Quantum" (Quantum Leap) tv serie?<br /><br />In this tv serie, a man travel in the time and become another person (the one he must help or save) the time of an episode, when he change this person destiny, don't know how or why, he is projected in the time one more time, etc...<br /><br />To keep maps linked, could make a similar thing, allowing different physical heroes, different places and times, but with a strong storyline in the back of each adventures.</div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bittoman wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">A time traveling platoon of Strogg comes to early industrial Earth.  Invading a military base they manage to blow a whole in the side of the brigg.  You are a military prisoner who escapes and ends up fending for himself while trying to battle the Strogg.  Cutting to the end you defeat the Strogg and earn a hero's medal.<br /><br />Kind of a Wolfenstein 3D with different characters.  Doom 3 seems to be extremely well suited to a dark, greasy industrial era (lighting-wise).  Would be a good setting if the adventure were set in an all night raid and would minimize the number of NPC models necessary for the mod (a little less work), mostly just needing to re-skin current player models to fit them with more modern uniforms or prison outfits.  I can see this done with a little Duke Nukem style humor too.</div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bittoman wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">It could be something done as an extension to the Doom 3 game so how about a role reversal where you're an Imp battling invading Marines?</div></div>]]></body></post><post id="p171485" date="Posted: Sun Feb 25, 2007 2:26 am "><author>Bittoman</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I think it would be smart to start small.  By small I don't necessarily mean content but in the actual mod size.  Even more specifically the number of maps being kept to a small numbers (maybe a half dozen or less).  This would be for a "first installment".  My reasons is one of the hardest things to keep a mod group going is the interest in it, if the project can have a near and clear ending then confidence of what the team is capable of will be significantly boosted, when the project is completed confidence gets an even bigger boost.  Using that inertia the project could be expanded.  Maybe even an episodic type of adventure like the Half Life 2 episodes (on a much smaller scale).
<br /><br />Other than this I think it's also important to nail down what kind of mod would be in mind.  Should this be a multiplayer mod or a singleplayer mod?  Keeping in mind what I said above, choosing one or the other would be smart and not trying to combine the two saving that for the "next installment" maybe.  Personally I'd be interested in seeing a single player game that featured some new objects (weapons, tools, etc.) that pushes the player to be more interactive with their world as opposed to the usual "if it moves, shoot it".  This might put a bit of emphasis on the programmer or whoever's handling level scripts though.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p171486" date="Posted: Sun Feb 25, 2007 2:32 am "><author>voldemort</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Well I would just like to say this I do mapping but layout is my downfall once blocked out and rough detailed --I like to go insane on detail items --so long as they dont affect fram rate that is Just figured I would share that since its my only real strength --preaty lame I know <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p171492" date="Posted: Sun Feb 25, 2007 3:44 am "><author>nbrancaccio</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Hey I like this idea! As you stated, it is a perfect solution for mod makers with all types of attention spans haha! Plus, it would be great for someone like myself, who is definatly interested in creating all sorts of assets, models, textures, maps you name it, but don't quite have the dedication for a full time mod, but at the same time, dont want my stuff going unused. This could really be a lot of fun.
<br /><br />I also liked your idea on having a sense of humor about it. I think mods these days are far too serious and try to be too professional, when they are truely missing the whole advantage of being modders: there is no distributor telling you what to do! You can be as edgy, wild, and crazy as you like <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />I could provide vurtually anything visual: Models, textures, texture sets, custom skyboxes... this could be fun!
<br /><br />Episodic is also key: simply releasing anything puts you a step above most other mod makers as most do not get released. Episodic releases would expedite this release.
<br /><br />nice!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p171500" date="Posted: Sun Feb 25, 2007 6:14 am "><author>Jack Rammsdell</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I have several ideas, but I am not going to share them all at once.

<br />would be cool to do a "what if" kinda story,
<br />lets say the nazzis won ww2 (not totally illogical
<br />IF the nazi leadership under Hitler had removed him from
<br />power just before that idiotic twofront idea he had
<br />about invading Soviet in 1941) and then move the timeline forward
<br />to about 2030 or similar, Mars is still Mars etc but instead of Betruger
<br />call the scientist something like Himmler the fourth,
<br />Reinhard Heydrich the third or similar, you get the drift,
<br />and then fill Mars with nazi swastika, do a couple of new
<br />levels thats kinda were unreachable in vanilla doom
<br />(theres doors that cannot be opened in vanilla d3,
<br />those new maps could be reached by those doors),
<br />all this could be a lot like RTCW i guess, but i fail to see how
<br />THAT cannot be anything but good since RTCW pwned  ; )
<br />Imagine running around in doom 3 with a MP44,
<br />MG42, stiefelhandgranaten and a flammenverfer  hehehe

<br />If we want action
<br />Definalty need to pick up the pace
<br />if we decide on horor it can go either way
<br /><br />If we do the pop out of the walls trick like ID  then slow for sure
<br />But if we use enviroment and audio to do the trick we can pick up the pace and still instill terror
<br /><br />One of the things That was missing between this doom and the first and second was  a fast pace of action --but this one definatly creates more an atmosphere

<br /><br />While I agree about the "Action is needed" stance, look at HL2.  The action there was filler between mono logs.  Yet that game still sold (honestly, i STILL don't know why).
<br /><br />re: jack's "non-violent" idea...
<br /><br />that idea DOES sound interesting (myst-like, i've had the same idea along with pbmax), the only issue I see is that the only people who would play are people who already owned D3, which is violent.

People throw out your ideas (don't forget that, odds are, amatures will be working on this to so don't except "RTH" or "Dark Mod" quality.  Just HOPE it!).  iI'm imagining something closer to "Duck Nukem" quality (being realistic here!)  iThen we'll vote.&#13;<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">IDEAS: </span></span>&#13;<br /><div class="quotetitle">The Happy Friar off original idea by Dinky wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Do a Doom 3 mod simular to the idea behind the Simpsons episode "22 short films about springfield."  It would be short sections (eposidioc like) based around the Doom 3 universe.  The reason I like this is that stary 1 could be based around you being one of the guys from Bravo company that gets slaughtered, another could be you're "Bob the Imp" (from planetdoom's comic) &amp; go on an adventure as him, one could be you walk through a teleporter &amp; end up in an "alternate universe" where the demons made teleporters &amp; marines are invading hell (as the bad guys).   Along the same lines would be an idea like the "Simpsons Spinoff Showcase" where the storys aren't all in the D3 universe.  <br /><br />Imagination is the limit.  Lots of D3 assets will be used so we won't depend on all new weapon models, code, assets, levels, etc.  We can do more creative stuff though, like make new weapons, a new baddie or two, put in more puzzle's (i really liked this about Prey).  <br /><br />Also, modders will be able to work on parts they like.  Me, for example, doesn't really want to do a super-serious mod, so me &amp; a couple other modders could work on a short story that gets kinda silly.<br /><br />A HUGE advantage I see to this type of mod is the attention span of the modders.  We won't be spending months to years on one single idea.  I feel with more variety we'll have less modders who start just disapear for no reason.<br /><br />The biggest problem I see is the coding.  If I want a weapon system that uses duel-weapons seperetly (ala "RTH") &amp; someone else wants all alt-fire, that could be a problem (i'm not a great coder so, as far as I'm concerned, if i can't figure it out i'm not doing the right thing!).  Problems along that line.</div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Jack Rammsdell wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I have several ideas, but I am not going to share them all at once.

So the idea is a 3rd person survival horror mod that is based in modern time in a small town. The concept is when the power goes out the demons come. every 10 mins the town will blackout and you must try to keep a generator running to decrease the amount of time that the power is out for a better chance of survival. so you must find items such as a flashlight, weapons, fuel, food, batteries ect.. to survive the blackouts.<br /><br />There would be no need to create a whole town, just a house with a backyard and a wooden fence to keep you in.<br /><br />If thirdperson isn't possible, then it would be just as fun in firstperson, because then you would have a chance to have a more interactive enviroment and allow the player to open cabinets and drawers and all sorts of stuff to search for much needed items. </div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">mikebart wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I’ll contribute where I can but I couldn’t commit full time, I’m way too unreliable at the moment, I’ve got a few ideas for the project though, just a simple brief really im sure a few things have been said before.<br /><br />3-5 small single player showcase maps: displaying advanced modelling, texturing, lighting, physics, coding etc, each with its own theme e.g. horror, sci-fi, fantasy, modern day, stroggos.<br />In addition to each of the showcase maps we have multi player maps which follow the same theme as their single player parent but geared more towards performance rather than graphics and effects.<br />Assets from ‘both’ could be used for other ideas such as short stories and which in turn could provide assets for the single and multi player maps.<br /><br />All the textures and models used in the single player showcase maps could be rendered/projected out to simpler assets to be used in the lower poly multiplayer maps. But this doesn’t mean the multiplayer maps can’t exist until the single player maps have been started they can both be worked on in tandem providing assets for each other.</div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">6th Venom wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Do you remember about "Code Quantum" (Quantum Leap) tv serie?<br /><br />In this tv serie, a man travel in the time and become another person (the one he must help or save) the time of an episode, when he change this person destiny, don't know how or why, he is projected in the time one more time, etc...<br /><br />To keep maps linked, could make a similar thing, allowing different physical heroes, different places and times, but with a strong storyline in the back of each adventures.</div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bittoman wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">A time traveling platoon of Strogg comes to early industrial Earth.  Invading a military base they manage to blow a whole in the side of the brigg.  You are a military prisoner who escapes and ends up fending for himself while trying to battle the Strogg.  Cutting to the end you defeat the Strogg and earn a hero's medal.<br /><br />Kind of a Wolfenstein 3D with different characters.  Doom 3 seems to be extremely well suited to a dark, greasy industrial era (lighting-wise).  Would be a good setting if the adventure were set in an all night raid and would minimize the number of NPC models necessary for the mod (a little less work), mostly just needing to re-skin current player models to fit them with more modern uniforms or prison outfits.  I can see this done with a little Duke Nukem style humor too.</div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bittoman wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">It could be something done as an extension to the Doom 3 game so how about a role reversal where you're an Imp battling invading Marines?</div></div>]]></body></post><post id="p171485" date="Posted: Sun Feb 25, 2007 2:26 am "><author>Bittoman</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I think it would be smart to start small.  By small I don't necessarily mean content but in the actual mod size.  Even more specifically the number of maps being kept to a small numbers (maybe a half dozen or less).  This would be for a "first installment".  My reasons is one of the hardest things to keep a mod group going is the interest in it, if the project can have a near and clear ending then confidence of what the team is capable of will be significantly boosted, when the project is completed confidence gets an even bigger boost.  Using that inertia the project could be expanded.  Maybe even an episodic type of adventure like the Half Life 2 episodes (on a much smaller scale).&#13;<br /><br />Other than this I think it's also important to nail down what kind of mod would be in mind.  Should this be a multiplayer mod or a singleplayer mod?  Keeping in mind what I said above, choosing one or the other would be smart and not trying to combine the two saving that for the "next installment" maybe.  Personally I'd be interested in seeing a single player game that featured some new objects (weapons, tools, etc.) that pushes the player to be more interactive with their world as opposed to the usual "if it moves, shoot it".  This might put a bit of emphasis on the programmer or whoever's handling level scripts though.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p171486" date="Posted: Sun Feb 25, 2007 2:32 am "><author>voldemort</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Well I would just like to say this I do mapping but layout is my downfall once blocked out and rough detailed --I like to go insane on detail items --so long as they dont affect fram rate that is Just figured I would share that since its my only real strength --preaty lame I know <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p171492" date="Posted: Sun Feb 25, 2007 3:44 am "><author>nbrancaccio</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Hey I like this idea! As you stated, it is a perfect solution for mod makers with all types of attention spans haha! Plus, it would be great for someone like myself, who is definatly interested in creating all sorts of assets, models, textures, maps you name it, but don't quite have the dedication for a full time mod, but at the same time, dont want my stuff going unused. This could really be a lot of fun.&#13;<br /><br />I also liked your idea on having a sense of humor about it. I think mods these days are far too serious and try to be too professional, when they are truely missing the whole advantage of being modders: there is no distributor telling you what to do! You can be as edgy, wild, and crazy as you like <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />I could provide vurtually anything visual: Models, textures, texture sets, custom skyboxes... this could be fun!&#13;<br /><br />Episodic is also key: simply releasing anything puts you a step above most other mod makers as most do not get released.

						<div class="postbody">referencing <a href="viewtopic.php?t=18836" class="postlink">the Mod Idea Thread</a>, lets think of idea for the mod.  People throw out your ideas (don't forget that, odds are, amatures will be working on this to so don't except "RTH" or "Dark Mod" quality.  Just HOPE it!).  iI'm imagining something closer to "Duck Nukem" quality (being realistic here!)  iThen we'll vote.&#13;<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">IDEAS: </span></span>&#13;<br /><div class="quotetitle">The Happy Friar off original idea by Dinky wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Do a Doom 3 mod simular to the idea behind the Simpsons episode "22 short films about springfield."  It would be short sections (eposidioc like) based around the Doom 3 universe.  The reason I like this is that stary 1 could be based around you being one of the guys from Bravo company that gets slaughtered, another could be you're "Bob the Imp" (from planetdoom's comic) &amp; go on an adventure as him, one could be you walk through a teleporter &amp; end up in an "alternate universe" where the demons made teleporters &amp; marines are invading hell (as the bad guys).   Along the same lines would be an idea like the "Simpsons Spinoff Showcase" where the storys aren't all in the D3 universe.  <br /><br />Imagination is the limit.  Lots of D3 assets will be used so we won't depend on all new weapon models, code, assets, levels, etc.  We can do more creative stuff though, like make new weapons, a new baddie or two, put in more puzzle's (i really liked this about Prey).  <br /><br />Also, modders will be able to work on parts they like.  Me, for example, doesn't really want to do a super-serious mod, so me &amp; a couple other modders could work on a short story that gets kinda silly.<br /><br />A HUGE advantage I see to this type of mod is the attention span of the modders.  We won't be spending months to years on one single idea.  I feel with more variety we'll have less modders who start just disapear for no reason.<br /><br />The biggest problem I see is the coding.  If I want a weapon system that uses duel-weapons seperetly (ala "RTH") &amp; someone else wants all alt-fire, that could be a problem (i'm not a great coder so, as far as I'm concerned, if i can't figure it out i'm not doing the right thing!).  Problems along that line.</div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Jack Rammsdell wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I have several ideas, but I am not going to share them all at once.  How about doing something that almost every doom 3 mod isn't, why not make a completly non-violent mod where the player is on a quest to find his way home and encounters a variety of puzzles and task sequences.  I know it may seem boring to some people who live off violence, but it would be something that would be accepted by a large community and could be enjoyed by a larger group of people.  It would be a good opportunity to mix both real world and fantasy settings.  With settings such as a haunted castle or other strange enviroments that could be seen in a sort of riven or myst game.  </div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">vinnie_jones wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><span style="font-weight: bold">removed</span> </div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Jack Rammsdell wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">What about a Deathmatch mod with gothic, industrial, and technology based enviroments that brought in the feel of quake 3 and the looks of quake 4.  With enhanced deathmatch physics and possibly tinman's bot support.  So then mappers can go off and map their own ideas and no matter how different the style is, it would fit with the project, unless someone was to pull a funny and make a map of all bunnies and colors <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> or something along that lines.<br />How about in every story there is a key character in a dangerous situation and ultimately survives. Then each charcter is brought before the vadrigar themselves and thrown into an arena to fight, so now we are mixing the short stories, deathmatch and quake 3</div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bo$bevok wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">i say we make a doom3 game set on earth...<br /><br />if we do the short story idea we could have a chapter or level or whatever on earth</div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Jack Rammsdell wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">last saturday our town was hit with a heavy sleet that knocked the power off for a few hours. which gave me an idea for a small survival horror scenario.<br /><br />I've always wanted to do 3rd person because it was so differnt from the standard FPS games we all play. So the idea is a 3rd person survival horror mod that is based in modern time in a small town. The concept is when the power goes out the demons come. every 10 mins the town will blackout and you must try to keep a generator running to decrease the amount of time that the power is out for a better chance of survival. so you must find items such as a flashlight, weapons, fuel, food, batteries ect.. to survive the blackouts.<br /><br />There would be no need to create a whole town, just a house with a backyard and a wooden fence to keep you in.<br /><br />If thirdperson isn't possible, then it would be just as fun in firstperson, because then you would have a chance to have a more interactive enviroment and allow the player to open cabinets and drawers and all sorts of stuff to search for much needed items. </div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">mikebart wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I’ll contribute where I can but I couldn’t commit full time, I’m way too unreliable at the moment, I’ve got a few ideas for the project though, just a simple brief really im sure a few things have been said before.<br /><br />3-5 small single player showcase maps: displaying advanced modelling, texturing, lighting, physics, coding etc, each with its own theme e.g. horror, sci-fi, fantasy, modern day, stroggos.<br />In addition to each of the showcase maps we have multi player maps which follow the same theme as their single player parent but geared more towards performance rather than graphics and effects.<br />Assets from ‘both’ could be used for other ideas such as short stories and which in turn could provide assets for the single and multi player maps.<br /><br />All the textures and models used in the single player showcase maps could be rendered/projected out to simpler assets to be used in the lower poly multiplayer maps. But this doesn’t mean the multiplayer maps can’t exist until the single player maps have been started they can both be worked on in tandem providing assets for each other.</div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">6th Venom wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Do you remember about "Code Quantum" (Quantum Leap) tv serie?<br /><br />In this tv serie, a man travel in the time and become another person (the one he must help or save) the time of an episode, when he change this person destiny, don't know how or why, he is projected in the time one more time, etc...<br /><br />To keep maps linked, could make a similar thing, allowing different physical heroes, different places and times, but with a strong storyline in the back of each adventures.</div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bittoman wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">A time traveling platoon of Strogg comes to early industrial Earth.  Invading a military base they manage to blow a whole in the side of the brigg.  You are a military prisoner who escapes and ends up fending for himself while trying to battle the Strogg.  Cutting to the end you defeat the Strogg and earn a hero's medal.<br /><br />Kind of a Wolfenstein 3D with different characters.  Doom 3 seems to be extremely well suited to a dark, greasy industrial era (lighting-wise).  Would be a good setting if the adventure were set in an all night raid and would minimize the number of NPC models necessary for the mod (a little less work), mostly just needing to re-skin current player models to fit them with more modern uniforms or prison outfits.  I can see this done with a little Duke Nukem style humor too.</div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Bittoman wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">It could be something done as an extension to the Doom 3 game so how about a role reversal where you're an Imp battling invading Marines?</div></div>

						<div class="postbody">I think it would be smart to start small.  By small I don't necessarily mean content but in the actual mod size.  Even more specifically the number of maps being kept to a small numbers (maybe a half dozen or less).  This would be for a "first installment".  My reasons is one of the hardest things to keep a mod group going is the interest in it, if the project can have a near and clear ending then confidence of what the team is capable of will be significantly boosted, when the project is completed confidence gets an even bigger boost.  Using that inertia the project could be expanded.  Maybe even an episodic type of adventure like the Half Life 2 episodes (on a much smaller scale).&#13;<br /><br />Other than this I think it's also important to nail down what kind of mod would be in mind.  Should this be a multiplayer mod or a singleplayer mod?  Keeping in mind what I said above, choosing one or the other would be smart and not trying to combine the two saving that for the "next installment" maybe.  Personally I'd be interested in seeing a single player game that featured some new objects (weapons, tools, etc.) that pushes the player to be more interactive with their world as opposed to the usual "if it moves, shoot it".  This might put a bit of emphasis on the programmer or whoever's handling level scripts though.</div>

						<div class="postbody">Hey I like this idea! As you stated, it is a perfect solution for mod makers with all types of attention spans haha! Plus, it would be great for someone like myself, who is definatly interested in creating all sorts of assets, models, textures, maps you name it, but don't quite have the dedication for a full time mod, but at the same time, dont want my stuff going unused. This could really be a lot of fun.&#13;<br /><br />I also liked your idea on having a sense of humor about it. I think mods these days are far too serious and try to be too professional, when they are truely missing the whole advantage of being modders: there is no distributor telling you what to do! You can be as edgy, wild, and crazy as you like <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />I could provide vurtually anything visual: Models, textures, texture sets, custom skyboxes... this could be fun!&#13;<br /><br />Episodic is also key: simply releasing anything puts you a step above most other mod makers as most do not get released. Episodic releases would expedite this release.&#13;<br /><br />nice!</div>

How about doing something that almost every doom 3 mod isn't, why not make a completly non-violent mod where the player is on a quest to find his way home and encounters a variety of puzzles and task sequences.  I know it may seem boring to some people who live off violence, but it would be something that would be accepted by a large community and could be enjoyed by a larger group of people.  It would be a good opportunity to mix both real world and fantasy settings.  With settings such as a haunted castle or other strange enviroments that could be seen in a sort of riven or myst game.  &#13;<br /><br />I have 3 other ideas that are all completly differnt, so I'll get them sorted out and share them another time.</div>

						<div class="postbody">i didn't intend for this thread to critique ideas, just to post them (and perhaps more clarifying questions).&#13;<br /><br />While I agree about the "Action is needed" stance, look at HL2.  The action there was filler between mono logs.  Yet that game still sold (honestly, i STILL don't know why).&#13;<br /><br />re: jack's "non-violent" idea...&#13;<br /><br />that idea DOES sound interesting (myst-like, i've had the same idea along with pbmax), the only issue I see is that the only people who would play are people who already owned D3, which is violent.  Do you think people would re-install D3 for that, or perhaps, BUY a copy of D3 for that?  (obviously if it's good enough).  That would be a killer idea for a full-fledged game though.&#13;<br /><br />Me &amp; PBMax threw around a few ideas months ago.  One I had was a game where space-sheep are invading earth &amp; space-goats are defending it.  Pretty much you can imagine how that winds up just from the sheep &amp; goat motif.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />  Lots of cloven-betrayal in there!&#13;<br /><br />But that's what I like about the modular/eposidic/short story based mod idea.  The whistle can be wet in different types of ideas.</div>

People throw out your ideas (don't forget that, odds are, amatures will be working on this to so don't except "RTH" or "Dark Mod" quality.  Just HOPE it!).  iI'm imagining something closer to "Duck Nukem" quality (being realistic here!)  iThen we'll vote.
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">IDEAS: </span></span>
<br /><div class="quotetitle">The Happy Friar off original idea by Dinky wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Do a Doom 3 mod simular to the idea behind the Simpsons episode "22 short films about springfield."  It would be short sections (eposidioc like) based around the Doom 3 universe.  The reason I like this is that stary 1 could be based around you being one of the guys from Bravo company that gets slaughtered, another could be you're "Bob the Imp" (from planetdoom's comic) &amp; go on an adventure as him, one could be you walk through a teleporter &amp; end up in an "alternate universe" where the demons made teleporters &amp; marines are invading hell (as the bad guys).   Along the same lines would be an idea like the "Simpsons Spinoff Showcase" where the storys aren't all in the D3 universe.  <br /><br />Imagination is the limit.  Lots of D3 assets will be used so we won't depend on all new weapon models, code, assets, levels, etc.  We can do more creative stuff though, like make new weapons, a new baddie or two, put in more puzzle's (i really liked this about Prey).  <br /><br />Also, modders will be able to work on parts they like.  Me, for example, doesn't really want to do a super-serious mod, so me &amp; a couple other modders could work on a short story that gets kinda silly.<br /><br />A HUGE advantage I see to this type of mod is the attention span of the modders.  We won't be spending months to years on one single idea.  I feel with more variety we'll have less modders who start just disapear for no reason.<br /><br />The biggest problem I see is the coding.  If I want a weapon system that uses duel-weapons seperetly (ala "RTH") &amp; someone else wants all alt-fire, that could be a problem (i'm not a great coder so, as far as I'm concerned, if i can't figure it out i'm not doing the right thing!).  Problems along that line.</div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Jack Rammsdell wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I have several ideas, but I am not going to share them all at once.  How about doing something that almost every doom 3 mod isn't, why not make a completly non-violent mod where the player is on a quest to find his way home and encounters a variety of puzzles and task sequences.  I know it may seem boring to some people who live off violence, but it would be something that would be accepted by a large community and could be enjoyed by a larger group of people.  It would be a good opportunity to mix both real world and fantasy settings.  With settings such as a haunted castle or other strange enviroments that could be seen in a sort of riven or myst game.  </div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">vinnie_jones wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><span style="font-weight: bold">removed</span> </div><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Jack Rammsdell wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">What about a Deathmatch mod with gothic, industrial, and technology based enviroments that brought in the feel of quake 3 and the looks of quake 4.  With enhanced deathmatch physics and possibly tinman's bot support.  So then mappers can go off and map their own ideas and no matter how different the style is, it would fit with the project, unless someone was to pull a funny and make a map of all bunnies and colors <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> or something along that lines.<br />How about in every story there is a key character in a dangerous situation and ultimately survives.

<br /><br />While I agree about the "Action is needed" stance, look at HL2.  The action there was filler between mono logs.  Yet that game still sold (honestly, i STILL don't know why).
<br /><br />re: jack's "non-violent" idea...
<br /><br />that idea DOES sound interesting (myst-like, i've had the same idea along with pbmax), the only issue I see is that the only people who would play are people who already owned D3, which is violent.  Do you think people would re-install D3 for that, or perhaps, BUY a copy of D3 for that?  (obviously if it's good enough).  That would be a killer idea for a full-fledged game though.
<br /><br />Me &amp; PBMax threw around a few ideas months ago.  One I had was a game where space-sheep are invading earth &amp; space-goats are defending it.  Pretty much you can imagine how that winds up just from the sheep &amp; goat motif.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />  Lots of cloven-betrayal in there!

<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">IDEAS: </span></span>
<br /><div class="quotetitle">The Happy Friar off original idea by Dinky wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Do a Doom 3 mod simular to the idea behind the Simpsons episode "22 short films about springfield."  It would be short sections (eposidioc like) based around the Doom 3 universe.  The reason I like this is that stary 1 could be based around you being one of the guys from Bravo company that gets slaughtered, another could be you're "Bob the Imp" (from planetdoom's comic) &amp; go on an adventure as him, one could be you walk through a teleporter &amp; end up in an "alternate universe" where the demons made teleporters &amp; marines are invading hell (as the bad guys).   Along the same lines would be an idea like the "Simpsons Spinoff Showcase" where the storys aren't all in the D3 universe.  <br /><br />Imagination is the limit.  Lots of D3 assets will be used so we won't depend on all new weapon models, code, assets, levels, etc.  We can do more creative stuff though, like make new weapons, a new baddie or two, put in more puzzle's (i really liked this about Prey).  <br /><br />Also, modders will be able to work on parts they like.  Me, for example, doesn't really want to do a super-serious mod, so me &amp; a couple other modders could work on a short story that gets kinda silly.<br /><br />A HUGE advantage I see to this type of mod is the attention span of the modders.  We won't be spending months to years on one single idea.  I feel with more variety we'll have less modders who start just disapear for no reason.<br /><br />The biggest problem I see is the coding.  If I want a weapon system that uses duel-weapons seperetly (ala "RTH") &amp; someone else wants all alt-fire, that could be a problem (i'm not a great coder so, as far as I'm concerned, if i can't figure it out i'm not doing the right thing!).

<br />and then fill Mars with nazi swastika, do a couple of new
<br />levels thats kinda were unreachable in vanilla doom
<br />(theres doors that cannot be opened in vanilla d3,
<br />those new maps could be reached by those doors),
<br />all this could be a lot like RTCW i guess, but i fail to see how
<br />THAT cannot be anything but good since RTCW pwned  ; )
<br />Imagine running around in doom 3 with a MP44,
<br />MG42, stiefelhandgranaten and a flammenverfer  hehehe

<br /><br />While I agree about the "Action is needed" stance, look at HL2.  The action there was filler between mono logs.  Yet that game still sold (honestly, i STILL don't know why).
<br /><br />re: jack's "non-violent" idea...
<br /><br />that idea DOES sound interesting (myst-like, i've had the same idea along with pbmax), the only issue I see is that the only people who would play are people who already owned D3, which is violent.  Do you think people would re-install D3 for that, or perhaps, BUY a copy of D3 for that?  (obviously if it's good enough).  That would be a killer idea for a full-fledged game though.
<br /><br />Me &amp; PBMax threw around a few ideas months ago.  One I had was a game where space-sheep are invading earth &amp; space-goats are defending it.  Pretty much you can imagine how that winds up just from the sheep &amp; goat motif.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />  Lots of cloven-betrayal in there!

Now number 4&#13;
<br/><br/>
last saturday our town was hit with a heavy sleet that knocked the power off for a few hours.  which gave me an idea for a small survival horror scenario.  &#13;
<br/><br/>
I've always wanted to do 3rd person because it was so differnt from the standard FPS games we all play.  So the idea is a 3rd person survival horror mod that is based in modern time in a small town.  The concept is when the power goes out the demons come.  every 10 mins the town will blackout and you must try to keep a generator running to decrease the amount of time that the power is out for a better chance of survival.  so you must find items such as a flashlight, weapons, fuel, food, batteries ect.. to survive the blackouts.  &#13;
<br/><br/>
There would be no need to create a whole town, just a house with a backyard and a wooden fence to keep you in. &#13;
<br/><br/>
If thirdperson isn't possible, then it would be just as fun in firstperson, because then you would have a chance to have a more interactive enviroment and allow the player to open cabinets and drawers and all sorts of stuff to search for much needed items.&#13;
<br/><br/>
I have yet 3 other ideas but these were meant to be projects I would work on after my "alone" project.</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

This intriuges me.... we could make the inhabitants of the town trying to get to some kind of shelter intended to save people from disaster and you play the story of how each person fights their way to get there....&#13;
<br/>
You could have a disaster like in The Day After Tommorow but with monsters and puzzles and it also fits in perfectly with the short stories idea. Also you can have different settings of where each person is like a trainstation or shopping mall or mansion for the different stories...</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

Kind of a Wolfenstein 3D with different characters.  Doom 3 seems to be extremely well suited to a dark, greasy industrial era (lighting-wise).  Would be a good setting if the adventure were set in an all night raid and you could use "stealth" to work your way around the base (think Sam Fisher style but without the technology) and would minimize the number of NPC models necessary for the mod (a little less work), mostly just needing to re-skin current player models to fit them with more modern uniforms or prison outfits.  I can see this done with a little Duke Nukem style humor too.</span><span class="gensmall"><br/><br/>Last edited by Bittoman on Tue Feb 27, 2007 2:09 pm; edited 1 time in total</span></td>

This intriuges me.... we could make the inhabitants of the town trying to get to some kind of shelter intended to save people from disaster and you play the story of how each person fights their way to get there....&#13;
<br/>
You could have a disaster like in The Day After Tommorow but with monsters and puzzles and it also fits in perfectly with the short stories idea. Also you can have different settings of where each person is like a trainstation or shopping mall or mansion for the different stories...</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

unofficially... it has bots.  It hasn't been publicly announced but all evidence points towards it.&#13;

Uhhh... I don't think so. I'm pretty sure it's a multiplayer only game, and it will have absolutely no implementation of AI...

unofficially... it has bots.  It hasn't been publicly announced but all evidence points towards it.&#13;

but that doesn't matter, can't do a Doom universe game in Quake &amp; vice versa. Even with all the content limitations out of the box (bots != SP AI.

<br /><br />Uhhh... I don't think so. I'm pretty sure it's a multiplayer only game, and it will have absolutely no implementation of AI... But is everyone absolutely SURE that AI couldn't be put into Quake Wars for Modification? And by that I mean you couldn't take anything from D3 and put it in Quake Wars??
<br /><br />I'm not a programmer so I wouldn't know this specifically... I don't know how much the Quake Wars engine differ's from Doom 3, after all it's not even out yet.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p171772" date="Posted: Wed Feb 28, 2007 4:02 am "><author>The Happy Friar</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Dinky wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Uhhh...

<br /><br />unofficially... it has bots.  It hasn't been publicly announced but all evidence points towards it.
<br /><br />but that doesn't matter, can't do a Doom universe game in Quake &amp; vice versa. Even with all the content limitations out of the box (bots != SP AI.

<br /><br />we should have a few people, perhaps BNA, Rich &amp; someone else eliminate all the ideas except 2/3, then the "team" votes on the remaining ideas for which one to do.
<br /><br />That would be the most fair way to choose IMHO.
<br /><br />After we get an idea, and hopefully the 10 people, we can vote in a "mod gestapo" who will run the thing. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p171880" date="Posted: Fri Mar 02, 2007 1:07 am "><author>Jack Rammsdell</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">the Mod Geheime Staatspolizei, I don't know what BNA!'s background is, but I don't think he would like us calling the leaders the gestapo.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p171882" date="Posted: Fri Mar 02, 2007 1:20 am "><author>The Happy Friar</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">my first thought was "mod nazi" after JC's comment we need an "OGL Nazi" to keep it up to date.

<br /><br />Geheime Staatspolizei sounds more STASI than Gestapo (DDR vs Third Reich).
