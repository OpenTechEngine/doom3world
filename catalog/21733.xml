At least in that game, the protagonist has character of his own.<br /><br />BioShock I'm not so sure about. It's another one of those games where the main character is nothing more than a puppet for you to control. He never speaks or exhibits emotion (The audio log of him killing a puppy and crying afterwards barely counts for anything). The idea is that you are supposed to be the protagonist so the character is for the most part left in your hands.<br /><br />And while the story is good, it's going to be very hard to draft up a personality that fits when everyone has their own ideas of who the main character is. Part of what made the game so cool was that you were given the option to be "evil". With a movie it can only go one direction and that scene is going to lose it's importance in the process. It may end up cut as a result.<br /><br />Another issue is that everyone who's played the game already knows the spoiler so if they stick to the same plot, the movie is already ruined. It would be impossible to sit through. I'd rather play through the game again.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p201739" date="Posted: Sat Jul 12, 2008 10:32 am "><author>BloodRayne</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Here's the/a bioshock movie trailer, not sure if it's anything official but it looks kinda ok, kinda like a childrens movie. <br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081116080901/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIl0AvuYQNU">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIl0AvuYQNU</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Max Payne will work. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081116080901im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081116080901/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JboQmDIdKWs">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JboQmDIdKWs</a><!-- m --></div>]]></body></post><post id="p201749" date="Posted: Sat Jul 12, 2008 1:32 pm "><author>KoRnScythe</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><span style="font-size: 50%; line-height: normal">Insert old, ancient text from the Bible here.</span><br /><br />Since I've time traveled, I'll start a new complaint and rant.<br /><br />Anyone else getting sick of fan-made, deceiving trailers?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p201752" date="Posted: Sat Jul 12, 2008 2:21 pm "><author>The Happy Friar</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">says right in the description of the bioshock trailer it's fanmade.  use footage from other things.<br /><br />max payne looks eh.
