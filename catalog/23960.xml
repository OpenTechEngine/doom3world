Everytime I open them they are just black images instead of the correct bluish purple ones. The diffuse maps import just fine.<br /><br />2) Suppose you where to alter the ingame textures. Lets say I am ingame and want to change a texture that looks really bad by today´s standards. How do I know what the texture is actually called in the .p4k file? Do I have to browse through all subfolders manually or is there a faster way of doing so ?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p227578" date="Posted: Mon Sep 27, 2010 7:05 pm "><author>anaho</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Forget about square one.
