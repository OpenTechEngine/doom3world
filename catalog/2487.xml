<br /><br /><br />EDIT by Goliath:
<br /><br />Well, you have to wait if you want to follow my tutorial... the export / def file information has changed with the release of Doom3, so the tutorial doesn't work anymore.
<br /><br />I'll update the tutorial as soon as I have the time and will re-post the links.
<br /><br />Update:
<br />Well bugger all.  It seems Maya 4.0 is not able to export models to MD5 with Doom3 anymore... which means I can't export any Maya files to see if the tutorial works.  
<br /><br />I think the id guys were using Maya 4.5 when they finished D3, so anyone with 4.5... 
<br /><br />EDIT:  Well, even with 4.5, it won't work (Thanks for testing, Brian, if you ever read these boards).  I should have noticed this before, but, quite simply, the Maya import .dll doesn't exist... period.  I imagine we'll be getting that w/ the SDK, but for now, we're S.O.L. unless we can talk Cat into updating his MD5 exporter for Maya....
