<br/><br/>
I not yet obtained to understand as to export a model to doom3 &#13;
<br/><br/>
here are some questions:&#13;
<br/><br/>
1 - Doom3 support the *.Ase format right??? Is only to place the archive in the folder inside models of the archive *.pk4? &#13;
<br/><br/>
2 - Ok, I texturized the model in 3dsmax8. When I export the model to the format *.ASE, the textures wil be inside of this archive? if not, how i place the textures in the model in the game? &#13;
<br/><br/>
thanks&#13;
<br/><br/><br/>
