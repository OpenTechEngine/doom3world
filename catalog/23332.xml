As I remember there were some strange distortions near the edges of my textures when I used my high maps with relief mod. I can give u few of my textures to test it.

So if the edge of height map isn't at absolute zero z position (full white), edge will be 'pushed inside' and reveal the "pushed inside" edge of another tile of the texture. Luckly i get holiday break from hospital to go home and i'll check, both the look of height map and is there way to just draw unwanted dent's white, so edge won't be pushed into the texture. I think i tried it earlier and shader actually did not see that and pushed inside the detailed edge from normal map instead of height o_o, but i have to recheck that.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Monoxead wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">By the way, if there is anyone who can make all affects as relief or maybe parallax, ambient, self and soft shadows in one damn shader!

It even has pictures!<br /><br />Unfortunately we can't do a correct implementation of the effect as it stands, but generally you can make something that looks close by 'baking,' or pre-applying the technique into the diffuse texture.

So if the edge of height map isn't at absolute zero z position (full white), edge will be 'pushed inside' and reveal the "pushed inside" edge of another tile of the texture. Luckly i get holiday break from hospital to go home and i'll check, both the look of height map and is there way to just draw unwanted dent's white, so edge won't be pushed into the texture. I think i tried it earlier and shader actually did not see that and pushed inside the detailed edge from normal map instead of height o_o, but i have to recheck that.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Monoxead wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">By the way, if there is anyone who can make all affects as relief or maybe parallax, ambient, self and soft shadows in one damn shader!

It even has pictures!<br /><br />Unfortunately we can't do a correct implementation of the effect as it stands, but generally you can make something that looks close by 'baking,' or pre-applying the technique into the diffuse texture. It isn't identical, but you get a lot of the same visual cues.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p221332" date="Posted: Thu Dec 24, 2009 9:57 am "><author>Monoxead</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Theftbot wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">can you post the model used in this image:<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225124513/http://lh5.ggpht.com/_ps8Bx7sAQxA/Sy-JOl3_WKI/AAAAAAAAAIw/eBUpBsbXCFA/s800/shot00007.jpg" class="postlink">http://lh5.ggpht.com/_ps8Bx7sAQxA/Sy-JOl3_WKI/AAAAAAAAAIw/eBUpBsbXCFA/s800/shot00007.jpg</a></div><br /><br />Here u are<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225124513/http://slil.ru/28396067">http://slil.ru/28396067</a><!-- m --><br />Can I ask what do u need it for?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p221333" date="Posted: Thu Dec 24, 2009 11:02 am "><author>Monoxead</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Superpipes:<br />Normalmap:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225124513/http://picasaweb.google.ru/lh/photo/XfcP4gE1XqIZGqXyMjsc_g?feat=directlink">http://picasaweb.google.ru/lh/photo/Xfc ... directlink</a><!-- m --><br />Highmap:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225124513/http://picasaweb.google.ru/lh/photo/v708d4XDu-qRToXPVyyXig?feat=directlink">http://picasaweb.google.ru/lh/photo/v70 ... directlink</a><!-- m --><br />Diffuse:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225124513/http://picasaweb.google.ru/lh/photo/dkTMteUrBYZznT3aLCI0GA?feat=directlink">http://picasaweb.google.ru/lh/photo/dkT ... directlink</a><!-- m --><br />Ambient:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225124513/http://picasaweb.google.ru/lh/photo/oYhoFk9ZgaQkgY7oQ5nBZQ?feat=directlink">http://picasaweb.google.ru/lh/photo/oYh ... directlink</a><!-- m --><br />Diffuse+Ambient:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225124513/http://picasaweb.google.ru/lh/photo/gJDeVxdem4VNLPOutmeWcw?feat=directlink">http://picasaweb.google.ru/lh/photo/gJD ... directlink</a><!-- m --><br />Specularmap:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225124513/http://picasaweb.google.ru/lh/photo/BQX29rN-KyQtJIVE2y_YmA?feat=directlink">http://picasaweb.google.ru/lh/photo/BQX ... directlink</a><!-- m --><br /><br />I'll try to make all other textures the same way.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p221335" date="Posted: Thu Dec 24, 2009 2:58 pm "><author>Monoxead</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">mth wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">there already is <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225124513im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />, check the topic IDtech4 shaders pack, made by Sikk, there are 42 flavours of shaders, with two different models of ambient, self-shadowing, relief, parallax, you can choose which ever You want with all the features You want. i wouldn't suggest investing in parallax though, it's mess and give You artifacts too. Relief is much better and the way to go, if You want to invest your time in height maps.</div> It'll be grate if relief mod works correct with edges.
