<br /><br />Map and all assets
<br /><br />Latest test-build (12-30-2004):

<br /><br />==========================================
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Textures and Materials<br /><br />*** Note to All mappers ***</span>
<br /><br />Be sure to examine the changes with the material files.  Quite a bit has changed in order to keep things organized.
<br /><br />If you have already worked on a section that I haven't already updated and you don't want to have to redo anything, just use the texture find/replace tool within the editor... OR open the map in a text editor and make the changes manually using a text-based find/replace tool.
<br /><br />==========================================
<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal"><span style="font-weight: bold">Current path and file naming conventions</span></span>
<br /><br />Please follow these guidelines to ensure that your materials, models and other assets stay organized.
<br /><br />All file paths are relative to your <span style="font-style: italic">MOD</span> folder (i.e. C:\Doom3\MOD\maps\..., etc.).
<br /><br />All textures should have either a _d.tga, _s.tga or _local.tga suffix.  This is so that if any component of a material is broken, when the map editor tosses the warning error, it will mention which part of the material is broken or missing.  In other words, don't name your diffusemaps "textureName.tga", name them "textureName_d.tga".
<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">Textures</span>
<br /><br />Break the textures down using a per-building basis:
<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">/textures/euro/block#/buildingName/textureName/textureName_d.tga<br />/textures/euro/block#/buildingName/textureName/textureName_s.tga<br />/textures/euro/block#/buildingName/textureName/textureName_local.tga</div><br /><br />If you want sub-sections for any single building on your block (optional, but useful):<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">/textures/euro/block#/buildingName/sectionName/textureName/textureName_d.tga<br />/textures/euro/block#/buildingName/sectionName/textureName/textureName_s.tga<br />/textures/euro/block#/buildingName/sectionName/textureName/textureName_local.tga</div><br /><br />Any "shared" textures (pavement, road,etc.) should go here:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">/textures/euro/shared/userName/textureName/textureName_d.tga<br />/textures/euro/shared/userName/textureName/textureName_s.tga<br />/textures/euro/shared/userName/textureName/textureName_local.tga</div><br /><br /><br />Note how this means that there will be a seperate directory for each material.  Why?  Let's say you have several wall textures named "wall1, wall2, wall3, ... wall8.  Now, in that collection of images, you are missing wall5_s.tga or you need to make a change to it.  If all of those wall images (at least 3 images per material, so we're talking about 24 "wallN" images)  are in one directory (along with tons of other images from other materials), you might miss what you're looking for.   The method described above will help others (and yourself) keep everything organized.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">Materials</span><br /><br />So how should the material files look?  Note how the material name actually points to the <span style="font-style: italic">directory</span> that contains the .tga files.  Of course, a material name can be anything, say "/textures/chopped_liver" and still point to these images as its components: "/textures/euro/shared/goliathvt/pile_o_poo/pile_o_poo_d.tga|_s.tga|_local.tga".<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">// sample material file<br /><br />/textures/euro/block#/buldingName/textureName<br />{<br />   qer_editorimage textures/euro/block#/buldingName/textureName/textureName_d.tga<br /><br />   diffusemap      textures/euro/block#/buldingName/textureName/textureName_d.tga<br />   specularmap     textures/euro/block#/buldingName/textureName/textureName_s.tga<br />   bumpmap         textures/euro/block#/buldingName/textureName/textureName_local.tga<br />}</div><br /><br />Take a look at how I organized the textures in the test-build 1 map for some real-world examples.<br /><br />This means that if you have a problem with a material and D3 throws a warning about not being able to find "x" material, you can just browse to the textureName directory and quickly check that all 3 images are there.  If you've named your images correctly, the warning message will even spescifcy _d, _s, or _local.  <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">Static Models</span><br /><br />If the model is specific to your block:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">/models/euro/block#/modelName/modelName_d.tga<br />/models/euro/block#/modelName/modelName_s.tga<br />/models/euro/block#/modelName/modelName_local.tga<br /><br />/models/euro/block#/modelName/modelName.lwo|.ase</div><br /><br />If the model is to be shared (street lamps, etc.):<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">/models/euro/shared/userName/modelName/modelName_d.tga<br />/models/euro/shared/userName/modelName/modelName_s.tga<br />/models/euro/shared/userName/modelName/modelName_local.tga<br /><br />/models/euro/shared/userName/modelName/modelName.lwo|.ase</div><br /><br />Note how your model file (.lwo, .ase) is in the <span style="font-style: italic">same directory</span> as the .tga files.  <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">Animated Models, Articulated Figures</span><br /><br />These will probably all be shared, but if not, follow these guidelines but just replace "shared" with your block#:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">/models/md5/euro/shared/userName/modelName/modelName_d.tga<br />/models/md5/euro/shared/userName/modelName/modelName_s.tga<br />/models/md5/euro/shared/userName/modelName/modelName_local.tga<br /><br />/models/md5/euro/shared/userName/modelName/modelName.md5mesh<br />/models/md5/euro/shared/userName/modelName/modelName_animName.md5anim<br /><br />/models/md5/euro/shared/userName/modelName/modelName.mb<br />/models/md5/euro/shared/userName/modelName/modelName_animName.mb</div>
<br /><br />Note how the .md5mesh, md5anim and .mb (or other source) files are all in the <span style="font-style: italic">same directory</span> as the .tga files.
<br /><br />The material definitions for models and animated models and articulated figures should follow the conventions listed above... that is, the material name should point to the <span style="font-style: italic">directory</span> that contains all of the .tga and .lwo|.ase|.md5mesh, etc. files for that model.  
<br /><br />==========================================
<br /><br />Let me know if all of that makes sense or if you have any questions or comments.

<br /><br />I suggest something simple like:
<br /><br />textures/euro/ - Base editing textures only.
<br /><br />textures/euro/X/ (X=Block number) specific for the block.
<br /><br />The mtr filenames:
<br />euro.mtr - Base editing textures only.
<br />euro_X - (X=Block number) specific for the block.
<br /><br />If possible snapshot(WIP) releases of buildings could be released as prefabs ( since the XYZ for the block should match the original basemap this should make it very easy to piece the whole thing together. )
<br />Also as textures get created, snapshot releases of the euro_X.mtr and texture/euro/X directory could be released, then some texture sharing can happen without worry of someone elses .pk4 overwriting anything.
<br />They should be lots of cases of local &amp; spec images being reused with different diffuse images, this will save some memory.
<br /><br />Main question is how and where - the best idea would be an ftp site we can all access.
<br /><br />Although I'm a sysadmin for our webserver at work I don't think  my boss would be too keen on me using it to host this, unfortunately he's a techie too so could find out <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121165910im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p66428" date="Posted: Mon Dec 06, 2004 1:49 am "><author>goliathvt</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I think we need to set some standards for paths before too many people start making textures and mtr files....<br /><br />textures/euro/ - Base editing textures only.<br />textures/euro/X/ (X=Block number) specific for the block.<br /><br />The mtr filenames:<br />euro.mtr - Base editing textures only.<br />euro_X - (X=Block number) specific for the block.<br /></div>
<br /><br />I think this is a great convention to use... with one addition/extension:  Let's give each individual texture their own directory, so we don't have a gazillion "base" textures sitting in /textures/euro/ or several images from different textures sitting in euro/block#/....  
<br /><br />So, for example, the dir structure might look like:
<br /><br />/textures/euro/base/roadpavement
<br />/textures/euro/base/concrete
<br />/textures/euro/base/wood
<br />/textures/euro/base/brick1
<br />/textures/euro/base/brick2
<br />/textures/euro/base/gravel
<br />/textures/euro/base/cobblestone
<br /><br />/textures/euro/block1/woodfence
<br />/textures/euro/block1/brick01
<br />/textures/euro/block1/brick02
<br />/textures/euro/block1/concreteb1
<br />/textures/euro/block1/doormat
<br />/textures/euro/block1/drywall
<br />/textures/euro/block1/rooftop1
<br />/textures/euro/block1/rooftop2
<br />/textures/euro/block1/rooftop3
<br /><br />/textures/euro/block2/metalrailings
<br />/textures/euro/block2/brick01
<br />/textures/euro/block2/woodfence
<br />/textures/euro/block2/stone01
<br />/textures/euro/block2/stone02
<br />/textures/euro/block2/rooftop1
<br />/textures/euro/block2/rooftop2
<br />/textures/euro/block2/rooftop3
<br /><br />...
<br /><br />etc.
<br /><br />Where each directory would then contain the qer image, diffuse, spec, and normal maps.  
<br /><br />I also agree that each "block" should get its own .mtr file.  Maybe this could even be extended to each building?

<br /><br />So long as everyone works to the folder structures put in place, we can have custom .mtr files for the duration of the project until we are ready to distribute.
<br /><br />For instance, I would call my material file bb_euro.mtr
<br /><br />When we're ready for distribution, it's just a case of copying all of the mtr files into a single euro.mtr file, as keeping track of multiple material files that have the same name which people are working on could be troublesome.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p66480" date="Posted: Mon Dec 06, 2004 1:29 pm "><author>goliathvt</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I disagree a bit... I think it's good to split up stuff while in production and have the author's name in the mtr filename, too, since then we know who made what texture and who to talk to about adding, modifying or fixing something.  But I also think it would be a good idea to add "block#" or "base" to the filename, and split up .mtr files that way... so you might have:
<br /><br />/materials/euro_base_bb.mtr
<br />/materials/euro_block1_bb.mtr
<br /><br />Someone else might have:
<br /><br />/materials/euro_base_severedx.mtr
<br />/materials/euro_block6_severedx.mtr
<br /><br />And if someone contributes some textures used in Block 6 other than SeveredX, then there might be:
<br /><br />/materials/euro_block6_goliath.mtr
<br /><br />etc.
<br /><br />That would allow people to have custom mtr files throughout development, and should get rid of the need to copy them all together at the end.  It also gives an indication of who made what textures... of which, even with the few we have now, I've been having trouble keeping track.

<br /><br />Make sense to me for the mtr files.
<br /><br />As for the directories:
<br />I think will a lot safer to use sub folders per block.
<br />I have textures with names like brick02.tga that are different from brick02  I downloaded for this project.
<br /><br />Simple paths would make sense
<br />/textures/euro/block2
<br /><br />When I said before about "Base editing textures only" I was refering to the editor textures 256.tga 512.tga etc and not things like base_wall1 etc.
<br /><br />If people want to structure things like:
<br />/textures/euro/block2/base_wall/ 
<br />Then that's fine.
<br />Until we start sharing textures( and afterwards too ) there is a good change that we will end up with duplicate textures in different folders. I don't see this as a problem that needs worrying about unto all the texturing is done then someone lucky soul can go though and de-dup the textures. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121165910im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> before the final .pk4 is assembled and released.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p66490" date="Posted: Mon Dec 06, 2004 2:33 pm "><author>bb_matt</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">One thing I've found when creating custom textures is the names.
<br /><br />For some reason, if I put a few underscores into texture names, often it just won't show up in editor/game.
<br /><br />For instance, stone_column_bb_d.tga won't work, but stone-column-bb_d.tga will.

<br /><br />I agree that there should be sub-folders per block... and there will most definitely need to be sub folders in the "shared" or "base" folder... whatever you want to call it.  I think it might be wise to add a person's name/initials to their texture filenames as well... that would get rid of the possibility of duplicate textures altogether (unless two people have the same initials/name, of course).  
<br /><br />So maybe adjust the texture dir structure to something like what Dante_uk suggests... but add:
<br /><br />/textures/euro/block2/base_wall/brick01_d-uk/(.tga files here)
<br />/textures/euro/block2/base_wall/drywall_d-uk/(.tga files here)
<br />/textures/euro/block2/base_floor/greentile_d-uk/(.tga files here)
<br /><br />etc.
<br /><br />How's that?

<br /><br />I think as was pointed out before use of underscore and hyphan causes problems.
<br />I never use - and only use _   e.g. wood_cracked_s.tga
<br /><br />I think initials on the files in the block folders is too much, in the shared/base folder it would be a very good idea.
<br />The block folders should only have textures added by the person for that block, but other people can use those textures in their blocks.
<br />ie block2 is Read/Write to me and just Read to everyone else.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p66512" date="Posted: Mon Dec 06, 2004 4:32 pm "><author>goliathvt</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I was thinking about the possibility of someone other than the "block author" contributing textures to it... but if you think it would be rare or minor enough of an issue to leave off designating to made what texture in the block folder, that's cool.

<br /><br />I'm creating new 'simple' textures as I go. Very basic stuff because my main building isn't plain brick, it's rendered and painted almost white, like your building.
<br /><br />When I'm done, I need to make some better textures that look more dirty, worn and lived in.

<br /><br />A CVS Server is a great idea, providing we pick one that handles binary data. I use TortoiseCVS ( free windows cvs client ) on my PC and it screwed up a load of jpg's I'd loaded into my CVS server on Linux ( Suse 8.2 cvs 1.11.5)
<br />Not sure why, wasn't important enough to check at the time.
<br /><br />My disk space is the standard 'free' web space provided by my ISP. I think I only have ftp access to it. ( no telnet or ssh, didn't try rlogin since no one should use that, ISP provide little info, obviously don't want peopel to actually use it <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121165910im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> ). Also 100mb won't be enough once the project start going with textures.
<br /><br />If I can get one of my old work laptops working with linux then I can set it up as an cvs server and leave it on and connected to the net for all to access. I'll look into doing this sometime this week if no one else steps forward with enough space to host.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p68719" date="Posted: Tue Dec 21, 2004 9:11 pm "><author>goliathvt</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I've got my CVS server up and running.

<br /><br />I now use TortoiseCVS, it's free and intergrates with Exporer so you can create a folder ( or use an existing folder ) and define a cvs server and module to it, from the context menu for the folder. Once it's a cvs folder you can right click and the context menu as all the options, like Cvs edit, Cvs comment, Cvs update etc.
<br />The files in the folders have their icons coloured to show their state, ie green for upto date, red for not in cvs etc.

<br /><br />Hey merlin.. glad folks' suggestions above worked for you.
<br /><br />FYI for other folks:
<br /><br />D3 Version 1.1 finally fixes the issue where it <span style="font-style: italic">will</span> recognize any mod folder (that is, with unzipped/un-pak'd files) and display the folder as a mod on the Load Mods menu.  So, if you don't want to put everything into a pk4 file, you can create a directory "euro" at the same level as your "base" directory and then drop the files in there, unzipped.  When you run Doom 3 and select "Load Mods", you should see the euro directory listed.  Load the mod and you're ready to go.
<br /><br />Or, of course, you can also create a shortcut w/ "+fs_game euro" in it... <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121122927im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />G</div>]]></body></post><post id="p70533" date="Posted: Wed Jan 05, 2005 9:35 am "><author>Spanner</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">For anyone whose interested I've made a set of skybox day/night textures that are cloudless/sunless - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121122927/http://members.iinet.net.au/~nc_hall/spanner_sky.zip" class="postlink">spanner_sky.zip - 2.7MB</a>.

<br /><br />Map and all assets
<br /><br />Latest test-build (12-30-2004):

<br /><br />==========================================
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Textures and Materials<br /><br />*** Note to All mappers ***</span>
<br /><br />Be sure to examine the changes with the material files.  Quite a bit has changed in order to keep things organized.
<br /><br />If you have already worked on a section that I haven't already updated and you don't want to have to redo anything, just use the texture find/replace tool within the editor... OR open the map in a text editor and make the changes manually using a text-based find/replace tool.
<br /><br />==========================================
<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal"><span style="font-weight: bold">Current path and file naming conventions</span></span>
<br /><br />Please follow these guidelines to ensure that your materials, models and other assets stay organized.
<br /><br />All file paths are relative to your <span style="font-style: italic">MOD</span> folder (i.e. C:\Doom3\MOD\maps\..., etc.).
<br /><br />All textures should have either a _d.tga, _s.tga or _local.tga suffix.  This is so that if any component of a material is broken, when the map editor tosses the warning error, it will mention which part of the material is broken or missing.  In other words, don't name your diffusemaps "textureName.tga", name them "textureName_d.tga".
<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">Textures</span>
<br /><br />Break the textures down using a per-building basis:
<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">/textures/euro/block#/buildingName/textureName/textureName_d.tga<br />/textures/euro/block#/buildingName/textureName/textureName_s.tga<br />/textures/euro/block#/buildingName/textureName/textureName_local.tga</div><br /><br />If you want sub-sections for any single building on your block (optional, but useful):<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">/textures/euro/block#/buildingName/sectionName/textureName/textureName_d.tga<br />/textures/euro/block#/buildingName/sectionName/textureName/textureName_s.tga<br />/textures/euro/block#/buildingName/sectionName/textureName/textureName_local.tga</div><br /><br />Any "shared" textures (pavement, road,etc.) should go here:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">/textures/euro/shared/userName/textureName/textureName_d.tga<br />/textures/euro/shared/userName/textureName/textureName_s.tga<br />/textures/euro/shared/userName/textureName/textureName_local.tga</div><br /><br /><br />Note how this means that there will be a seperate directory for each material.  Why?  Let's say you have several wall textures named "wall1, wall2, wall3, ... wall8.  Now, in that collection of images, you are missing wall5_s.tga or you need to make a change to it.  If all of those wall images (at least 3 images per material, so we're talking about 24 "wallN" images)  are in one directory (along with tons of other images from other materials), you might miss what you're looking for.   The method described above will help others (and yourself) keep everything organized.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">Materials</span><br /><br />So how should the material files look?  Note how the material name actually points to the <span style="font-style: italic">directory</span> that contains the .tga files.  Of course, a material name can be anything, say "/textures/chopped_liver" and still point to these images as its components: "/textures/euro/shared/goliathvt/pile_o_poo/pile_o_poo_d.tga|_s.tga|_local.tga".<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">// sample material file<br /><br />/textures/euro/block#/buldingName/textureName<br />{<br />   qer_editorimage textures/euro/block#/buldingName/textureName/textureName_d.tga<br /><br />   diffusemap      textures/euro/block#/buldingName/textureName/textureName_d.tga<br />   specularmap     textures/euro/block#/buldingName/textureName/textureName_s.tga<br />   bumpmap         textures/euro/block#/buldingName/textureName/textureName_local.tga<br />}</div><br /><br />Take a look at how I organized the textures in the test-build 1 map for some real-world examples.<br /><br />This means that if you have a problem with a material and D3 throws a warning about not being able to find "x" material, you can just browse to the textureName directory and quickly check that all 3 images are there.  If you've named your images correctly, the warning message will even spescifcy _d, _s, or _local.  <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">Static Models</span><br /><br />If the model is specific to your block:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">/models/euro/block#/modelName/modelName_d.tga<br />/models/euro/block#/modelName/modelName_s.tga<br />/models/euro/block#/modelName/modelName_local.tga<br /><br />/models/euro/block#/modelName/modelName.lwo|.ase</div><br /><br />If the model is to be shared (street lamps, etc.):<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">/models/euro/shared/userName/modelName/modelName_d.tga<br />/models/euro/shared/userName/modelName/modelName_s.tga<br />/models/euro/shared/userName/modelName/modelName_local.tga<br /><br />/models/euro/shared/userName/modelName/modelName.lwo|.ase</div><br /><br />Note how your model file (.lwo, .ase) is in the <span style="font-style: italic">same directory</span> as the .tga files.  <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">Animated Models, Articulated Figures</span><br /><br />These will probably all be shared, but if not, follow these guidelines but just replace "shared" with your block#:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">/models/md5/euro/shared/userName/modelName/modelName_d.tga<br />/models/md5/euro/shared/userName/modelName/modelName_s.tga<br />/models/md5/euro/shared/userName/modelName/modelName_local.tga<br /><br />/models/md5/euro/shared/userName/modelName/modelName.md5mesh<br />/models/md5/euro/shared/userName/modelName/modelName_animName.md5anim<br /><br />/models/md5/euro/shared/userName/modelName/modelName.mb<br />/models/md5/euro/shared/userName/modelName/modelName_animName.mb</div>
<br /><br />Note how the .md5mesh, md5anim and .mb (or other source) files are all in the <span style="font-style: italic">same directory</span> as the .tga files.
<br /><br />The material definitions for models and animated models and articulated figures should follow the conventions listed above... that is, the material name should point to the <span style="font-style: italic">directory</span> that contains all of the .tga and .lwo|.ase|.md5mesh, etc. files for that model.

<br /><br />Let me know if all of that makes sense or if you have any questions or comments.

<br /><br />I suggest something simple like:
<br /><br />textures/euro/ - Base editing textures only.
<br /><br />textures/euro/X/ (X=Block number) specific for the block.
<br /><br />The mtr filenames:
<br />euro.mtr - Base editing textures only.
<br />euro_X - (X=Block number) specific for the block.
<br /><br />If possible snapshot(WIP) releases of buildings could be released as prefabs ( since the XYZ for the block should match the original basemap this should make it very easy to piece the whole thing together. )
<br />Also as textures get created, snapshot releases of the euro_X.mtr and texture/euro/X directory could be released, then some texture sharing can happen without worry of someone elses .pk4 overwriting anything.
<br />They should be lots of cases of local &amp; spec images being reused with different diffuse images, this will save some memory.
<br /><br />Main question is how and where - the best idea would be an ftp site we can all access.
<br /><br />Although I'm a sysadmin for our webserver at work I don't think  my boss would be too keen on me using it to host this, unfortunately he's a techie too so could find out <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121165523im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p66428" date="Posted: Mon Dec 06, 2004 1:49 am "><author>goliathvt</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I think we need to set some standards for paths before too many people start making textures and mtr files....<br /><br />textures/euro/ - Base editing textures only.<br />textures/euro/X/ (X=Block number) specific for the block.<br /><br />The mtr filenames:<br />euro.mtr - Base editing textures only.<br />euro_X - (X=Block number) specific for the block.<br /></div>
<br /><br />I think this is a great convention to use... with one addition/extension:  Let's give each individual texture their own directory, so we don't have a gazillion "base" textures sitting in /textures/euro/ or several images from different textures sitting in euro/block#/....  
<br /><br />So, for example, the dir structure might look like:
<br /><br />/textures/euro/base/roadpavement
<br />/textures/euro/base/concrete
<br />/textures/euro/base/wood
<br />/textures/euro/base/brick1
<br />/textures/euro/base/brick2
<br />/textures/euro/base/gravel
<br />/textures/euro/base/cobblestone
<br /><br />/textures/euro/block1/woodfence
<br />/textures/euro/block1/brick01
<br />/textures/euro/block1/brick02
<br />/textures/euro/block1/concreteb1
<br />/textures/euro/block1/doormat
<br />/textures/euro/block1/drywall
<br />/textures/euro/block1/rooftop1
<br />/textures/euro/block1/rooftop2
<br />/textures/euro/block1/rooftop3
<br /><br />/textures/euro/block2/metalrailings
<br />/textures/euro/block2/brick01
<br />/textures/euro/block2/woodfence
<br />/textures/euro/block2/stone01
<br />/textures/euro/block2/stone02
<br />/textures/euro/block2/rooftop1
<br />/textures/euro/block2/rooftop2
<br />/textures/euro/block2/rooftop3
<br /><br />...
<br /><br />etc.
<br /><br />Where each directory would then contain the qer image, diffuse, spec, and normal maps.  
<br /><br />I also agree that each "block" should get its own .mtr file.  Maybe this could even be extended to each building?

<br /><br />So long as everyone works to the folder structures put in place, we can have custom .mtr files for the duration of the project until we are ready to distribute.
<br /><br />For instance, I would call my material file bb_euro.mtr
<br /><br />When we're ready for distribution, it's just a case of copying all of the mtr files into a single euro.mtr file, as keeping track of multiple material files that have the same name which people are working on could be troublesome.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p66480" date="Posted: Mon Dec 06, 2004 1:29 pm "><author>goliathvt</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I disagree a bit... I think it's good to split up stuff while in production and have the author's name in the mtr filename, too, since then we know who made what texture and who to talk to about adding, modifying or fixing something.

<br /><br />/materials/euro_base_bb.mtr

<br /><br />Someone else might have:

<br /><br />That would allow people to have custom mtr files throughout development, and should get rid of the need to copy them all together at the end.  It also gives an indication of who made what textures... of which, even with the few we have now, I've been having trouble keeping track.

<br /><br />Make sense to me for the mtr files.
<br /><br />As for the directories:
<br />I think will a lot safer to use sub folders per block.
<br />I have textures with names like brick02.tga that are different from brick02  I downloaded for this project.
<br /><br />Simple paths would make sense
<br />/textures/euro/block2
<br /><br />When I said before about "Base editing textures only" I was refering to the editor textures 256.tga 512.tga etc and not things like base_wall1 etc.
<br /><br />If people want to structure things like:
<br />/textures/euro/block2/base_wall/ 
<br />Then that's fine.
<br />Until we start sharing textures( and afterwards too ) there is a good change that we will end up with duplicate textures in different folders. I don't see this as a problem that needs worrying about unto all the texturing is done then someone lucky soul can go though and de-dup the textures. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121165523im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> before the final .pk4 is assembled and released.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p66490" date="Posted: Mon Dec 06, 2004 2:33 pm "><author>bb_matt</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">One thing I've found when creating custom textures is the names.
<br /><br />For some reason, if I put a few underscores into texture names, often it just won't show up in editor/game.

<br /><br />I agree that there should be sub-folders per block... and there will most definitely need to be sub folders in the "shared" or "base" folder... whatever you want to call it.  I think it might be wise to add a person's name/initials to their texture filenames as well... that would get rid of the possibility of duplicate textures altogether (unless two people have the same initials/name, of course).  
<br /><br />So maybe adjust the texture dir structure to something like what Dante_uk suggests... but add:
<br /><br />/textures/euro/block2/base_wall/brick01_d-uk/(.tga files here)
<br />/textures/euro/block2/base_wall/drywall_d-uk/(.tga files here)
<br />/textures/euro/block2/base_floor/greentile_d-uk/(.tga files here)

<br /><br />I think as was pointed out before use of underscore and hyphan causes problems.
<br />I never use - and only use _   e.g. wood_cracked_s.tga
<br /><br />I think initials on the files in the block folders is too much, in the shared/base folder it would be a very good idea.
<br />The block folders should only have textures added by the person for that block, but other people can use those textures in their blocks.
<br />ie block2 is Read/Write to me and just Read to everyone else.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p66512" date="Posted: Mon Dec 06, 2004 4:32 pm "><author>goliathvt</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I was thinking about the possibility of someone other than the "block author" contributing textures to it... but if you think it would be rare or minor enough of an issue to leave off designating to made what texture in the block folder, that's cool.

<br /><br />A CVS Server is a great idea, providing we pick one that handles binary data. I use TortoiseCVS ( free windows cvs client ) on my PC and it screwed up a load of jpg's I'd loaded into my CVS server on Linux ( Suse 8.2 cvs 1.11.5)
<br />Not sure why, wasn't important enough to check at the time.
<br /><br />My disk space is the standard 'free' web space provided by my ISP. I think I only have ftp access to it. ( no telnet or ssh, didn't try rlogin since no one should use that, ISP provide little info, obviously don't want peopel to actually use it <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121165523im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> ). Also 100mb won't be enough once the project start going with textures.
<br /><br />If I can get one of my old work laptops working with linux then I can set it up as an cvs server and leave it on and connected to the net for all to access. I'll look into doing this sometime this week if no one else steps forward with enough space to host.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p68719" date="Posted: Tue Dec 21, 2004 9:11 pm "><author>goliathvt</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I've got my CVS server up and running.

<br />The files in the folders have their icons coloured to show their state, ie green for upto date, red for not in cvs etc.
<br /><br />I do need to test again with binary files though as mentioned previously.
<br /><br />I'll mail you my block &amp; assets later tonight ( UK Time ). I'm at work now and don't have all my stuff here, just my latest .map and .mtr files. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121165523im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p69443" date="Posted: Tue Dec 28, 2004 3:58 am "><author>idiom</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I'm not sure where to put this but I've found a 'photorealistic' texture pack that might be useful <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121165523/http://www.planetquake.com/berneyboy/textures.htm" class="postlink">here</a>.

<br /><br />I thought it would be hard to get normal maps (without having actual source geometry) but it has actually turned out rather smooth to make them using a height2normal converter plus some "photochopping". Speculars were always easy-ish to create from scratch anyway. I still have all my assets in the previous organization scheme so as soon as I finish migrating to the new one I'll post them. In the meantime what do you think?
<br /><br />If you pardon my lack of modesty I'm quite taken aback by the results of the normal maps in the second one. As you can see from the top face, it's a just two polys but when looked as it's supposed to, the illusion of depth is uncanny.
<br /><br />EDIT: P.S. I forgot something, you may want to remove /textures/stone/sand01_s.tga as it's doing nothing since it's completely black and it's actually giving a speed hit.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p70176" date="Posted: Sun Jan 02, 2005 9:12 pm "><author>merlin371</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">K this might be a stupid question but how do I make a mod directory?

<br /><br />Hey merlin.. glad folks' suggestions above worked for you.
<br /><br />FYI for other folks:
<br /><br />D3 Version 1.1 finally fixes the issue where it <span style="font-style: italic">will</span> recognize any mod folder (that is, with unzipped/un-pak'd files) and display the folder as a mod on the Load Mods menu.  So, if you don't want to put everything into a pk4 file, you can create a directory "euro" at the same level as your "base" directory and then drop the files in there, unzipped.  When you run Doom 3 and select "Load Mods", you should see the euro directory listed.  Load the mod and you're ready to go.
<br /><br />Or, of course, you can also create a shortcut w/ "+fs_game euro" in it... <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121123357im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />G</div>]]></body></post><post id="p70533" date="Posted: Wed Jan 05, 2005 9:35 am "><author>Spanner</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">For anyone whose interested I've made a set of skybox day/night textures that are cloudless/sunless - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121123357/http://members.iinet.net.au/~nc_hall/spanner_sky.zip" class="postlink">spanner_sky.zip - 2.7MB</a>.

<br /><br />The only critique I have is that the night sky is a bit too dark. Considering that the moon is going to be visible, you should have enough light bouncing around in the atmosphere to be able to see the sillouettes of the buildings faintly against it.
<br /><br />For anyone interested, here is a great read on light theory that may prove helpful when it comes to lighting both indoor/outdoor scenes...

<br /><br />It's not entirely applicable to Doom 3 because we're restricted to point lights and altering intensity by adusting the brightness of color values but for the most part it should prove helpful.

<br /><br />==========================================
<br /><br />Map and all assets
<br /><br />Latest test-build (12-30-2004):
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121165523/http://www.pcgamemods.com/9410/">http://www.pcgamemods.com/9410/</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />==========================================
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Textures and Materials<br /><br />*** Note to All mappers ***</span>
<br /><br />Be sure to examine the changes with the material files.  Quite a bit has changed in order to keep things organized.
<br /><br />If you have already worked on a section that I haven't already updated and you don't want to have to redo anything, just use the texture find/replace tool within the editor... OR open the map in a text editor and make the changes manually using a text-based find/replace tool.
<br /><br />==========================================
<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal"><span style="font-weight: bold">Current path and file naming conventions</span></span>
<br /><br />Please follow these guidelines to ensure that your materials, models and other assets stay organized.
<br /><br />All file paths are relative to your <span style="font-style: italic">MOD</span> folder (i.e. C:\Doom3\MOD\maps\..., etc.).
<br /><br />All textures should have either a _d.tga, _s.tga or _local.tga suffix.  This is so that if any component of a material is broken, when the map editor tosses the warning error, it will mention which part of the material is broken or missing.  In other words, don't name your diffusemaps "textureName.tga", name them "textureName_d.tga".
<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">Textures</span>
<br /><br />Break the textures down using a per-building basis:
<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">/textures/euro/block#/buildingName/textureName/textureName_d.tga<br />/textures/euro/block#/buildingName/textureName/textureName_s.tga<br />/textures/euro/block#/buildingName/textureName/textureName_local.tga</div><br /><br />If you want sub-sections for any single building on your block (optional, but useful):<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">/textures/euro/block#/buildingName/sectionName/textureName/textureName_d.tga<br />/textures/euro/block#/buildingName/sectionName/textureName/textureName_s.tga<br />/textures/euro/block#/buildingName/sectionName/textureName/textureName_local.tga</div><br /><br />Any "shared" textures (pavement, road,etc.) should go here:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">/textures/euro/shared/userName/textureName/textureName_d.tga<br />/textures/euro/shared/userName/textureName/textureName_s.tga<br />/textures/euro/shared/userName/textureName/textureName_local.tga</div><br /><br /><br />Note how this means that there will be a seperate directory for each material.  Why?  Let's say you have several wall textures named "wall1, wall2, wall3, ... wall8.  Now, in that collection of images, you are missing wall5_s.tga or you need to make a change to it.  If all of those wall images (at least 3 images per material, so we're talking about 24 "wallN" images)  are in one directory (along with tons of other images from other materials), you might miss what you're looking for.   The method described above will help others (and yourself) keep everything organized.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">Materials</span><br /><br />So how should the material files look?  Note how the material name actually points to the <span style="font-style: italic">directory</span> that contains the .tga files.  Of course, a material name can be anything, say "/textures/chopped_liver" and still point to these images as its components: "/textures/euro/shared/goliathvt/pile_o_poo/pile_o_poo_d.tga|_s.tga|_local.tga".<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">// sample material file<br /><br />/textures/euro/block#/buldingName/textureName<br />{<br />   qer_editorimage textures/euro/block#/buldingName/textureName/textureName_d.tga<br /><br />   diffusemap      textures/euro/block#/buldingName/textureName/textureName_d.tga<br />   specularmap     textures/euro/block#/buldingName/textureName/textureName_s.tga<br />   bumpmap         textures/euro/block#/buldingName/textureName/textureName_local.tga<br />}</div><br /><br />Take a look at how I organized the textures in the test-build 1 map for some real-world examples.<br /><br />This means that if you have a problem with a material and D3 throws a warning about not being able to find "x" material, you can just browse to the textureName directory and quickly check that all 3 images are there.  If you've named your images correctly, the warning message will even spescifcy _d, _s, or _local.  <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">Static Models</span><br /><br />If the model is specific to your block:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">/models/euro/block#/modelName/modelName_d.tga<br />/models/euro/block#/modelName/modelName_s.tga<br />/models/euro/block#/modelName/modelName_local.tga<br /><br />/models/euro/block#/modelName/modelName.lwo|.ase</div><br /><br />If the model is to be shared (street lamps, etc.):<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">/models/euro/shared/userName/modelName/modelName_d.tga<br />/models/euro/shared/userName/modelName/modelName_s.tga<br />/models/euro/shared/userName/modelName/modelName_local.tga<br /><br />/models/euro/shared/userName/modelName/modelName.lwo|.ase</div><br /><br />Note how your model file (.lwo, .ase) is in the <span style="font-style: italic">same directory</span> as the .tga files.  <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">Animated Models, Articulated Figures</span><br /><br />These will probably all be shared, but if not, follow these guidelines but just replace "shared" with your block#:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">/models/md5/euro/shared/userName/modelName/modelName_d.tga<br />/models/md5/euro/shared/userName/modelName/modelName_s.tga<br />/models/md5/euro/shared/userName/modelName/modelName_local.tga<br /><br />/models/md5/euro/shared/userName/modelName/modelName.md5mesh<br />/models/md5/euro/shared/userName/modelName/modelName_animName.md5anim<br /><br />/models/md5/euro/shared/userName/modelName/modelName.mb<br />/models/md5/euro/shared/userName/modelName/modelName_animName.mb</div>
<br /><br />Note how the .md5mesh, md5anim and .mb (or other source) files are all in the <span style="font-style: italic">same directory</span> as the .tga files.
<br /><br />The material definitions for models and animated models and articulated figures should follow the conventions listed above... that is, the material name should point to the <span style="font-style: italic">directory</span> that contains all of the .tga and .lwo|.ase|.md5mesh, etc. files for that model.  
<br /><br />==========================================
<br /><br />Let me know if all of that makes sense or if you have any questions or comments.

<br /><br />I suggest something simple like:
<br /><br />textures/euro/ - Base editing textures only.
<br /><br />textures/euro/X/ (X=Block number) specific for the block.
<br /><br />The mtr filenames:
<br />euro.mtr - Base editing textures only.
<br />euro_X - (X=Block number) specific for the block.
<br /><br />If possible snapshot(WIP) releases of buildings could be released as prefabs ( since the XYZ for the block should match the original basemap this should make it very easy to piece the whole thing together. )
<br />Also as textures get created, snapshot releases of the euro_X.mtr and texture/euro/X directory could be released, then some texture sharing can happen without worry of someone elses .pk4 overwriting anything.
<br />They should be lots of cases of local &amp; spec images being reused with different diffuse images, this will save some memory.
<br /><br />Main question is how and where - the best idea would be an ftp site we can all access.
<br /><br />Although I'm a sysadmin for our webserver at work I don't think  my boss would be too keen on me using it to host this, unfortunately he's a techie too so could find out <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121165523im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p66428" date="Posted: Mon Dec 06, 2004 1:49 am "><author>goliathvt</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I think we need to set some standards for paths before too many people start making textures and mtr files....<br /><br />textures/euro/ - Base editing textures only.<br />textures/euro/X/ (X=Block number) specific for the block.<br /><br />The mtr filenames:<br />euro.mtr - Base editing textures only.<br />euro_X - (X=Block number) specific for the block.<br /></div>
<br /><br />I think this is a great convention to use... with one addition/extension:  Let's give each individual texture their own directory, so we don't have a gazillion "base" textures sitting in /textures/euro/ or several images from different textures sitting in euro/block#/....  
<br /><br />So, for example, the dir structure might look like:
<br /><br />/textures/euro/base/roadpavement
<br />/textures/euro/base/concrete
<br />/textures/euro/base/wood
<br />/textures/euro/base/brick1
<br />/textures/euro/base/brick2
<br />/textures/euro/base/gravel
<br />/textures/euro/base/cobblestone
<br /><br />/textures/euro/block1/woodfence
<br />/textures/euro/block1/brick01
<br />/textures/euro/block1/brick02
<br />/textures/euro/block1/concreteb1
<br />/textures/euro/block1/doormat
<br />/textures/euro/block1/drywall
<br />/textures/euro/block1/rooftop1
<br />/textures/euro/block1/rooftop2
<br />/textures/euro/block1/rooftop3
<br /><br />/textures/euro/block2/metalrailings
<br />/textures/euro/block2/brick01
<br />/textures/euro/block2/woodfence
<br />/textures/euro/block2/stone01
<br />/textures/euro/block2/stone02
<br />/textures/euro/block2/rooftop1
<br />/textures/euro/block2/rooftop2
<br />/textures/euro/block2/rooftop3
<br /><br />...
<br /><br />etc.

<br /><br />So long as everyone works to the folder structures put in place, we can have custom .mtr files for the duration of the project until we are ready to distribute.
<br /><br />For instance, I would call my material file bb_euro.mtr

<br /><br />Make sense to me for the mtr files.
<br /><br />As for the directories:
<br />I think will a lot safer to use sub folders per block.
<br />I have textures with names like brick02.tga that are different from brick02  I downloaded for this project.
<br /><br />Simple paths would make sense
<br />/textures/euro/block2
<br /><br />When I said before about "Base editing textures only" I was refering to the editor textures 256.tga 512.tga etc and not things like base_wall1 etc.
<br /><br />If people want to structure things like:
<br />/textures/euro/block2/base_wall/ 
<br />Then that's fine.
<br />Until we start sharing textures( and afterwards too ) there is a good change that we will end up with duplicate textures in different folders. I don't see this as a problem that needs worrying about unto all the texturing is done then someone lucky soul can go though and de-dup the textures. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121165523im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> before the final .pk4 is assembled and released.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p66490" date="Posted: Mon Dec 06, 2004 2:33 pm "><author>bb_matt</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">One thing I've found when creating custom textures is the names.

<br /><br />I agree that there should be sub-folders per block... and there will most definitely need to be sub folders in the "shared" or "base" folder... whatever you want to call it.  I think it might be wise to add a person's name/initials to their texture filenames as well... that would get rid of the possibility of duplicate textures altogether (unless two people have the same initials/name, of course).  
<br /><br />So maybe adjust the texture dir structure to something like what Dante_uk suggests... but add:

<br /><br />I think as was pointed out before use of underscore and hyphan causes problems.
<br />I never use - and only use _   e.g. wood_cracked_s.tga
<br /><br />I think initials on the files in the block folders is too much, in the shared/base folder it would be a very good idea.
<br />The block folders should only have textures added by the person for that block, but other people can use those textures in their blocks.

<br /><br />A CVS Server is a great idea, providing we pick one that handles binary data. I use TortoiseCVS ( free windows cvs client ) on my PC and it screwed up a load of jpg's I'd loaded into my CVS server on Linux ( Suse 8.2 cvs 1.11.5)
<br />Not sure why, wasn't important enough to check at the time.
<br /><br />My disk space is the standard 'free' web space provided by my ISP. I think I only have ftp access to it. ( no telnet or ssh, didn't try rlogin since no one should use that, ISP provide little info, obviously don't want peopel to actually use it <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121165523im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> ). Also 100mb won't be enough once the project start going with textures.
<br /><br />If I can get one of my old work laptops working with linux then I can set it up as an cvs server and leave it on and connected to the net for all to access. I'll look into doing this sometime this week if no one else steps forward with enough space to host.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p68719" date="Posted: Tue Dec 21, 2004 9:11 pm "><author>goliathvt</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I've got my CVS server up and running.

<br /><br />I thought it would be hard to get normal maps (without having actual source geometry) but it has actually turned out rather smooth to make them using a height2normal converter plus some "photochopping".

In the meantime what do you think?
<br /><br />If you pardon my lack of modesty I'm quite taken aback by the results of the normal maps in the second one. As you can see from the top face, it's a just two polys but when looked as it's supposed to, the illusion of depth is uncanny.

<br /><br />Hey merlin.. glad folks' suggestions above worked for you.
<br /><br />FYI for other folks:
<br /><br />D3 Version 1.1 finally fixes the issue where it <span style="font-style: italic">will</span> recognize any mod folder (that is, with unzipped/un-pak'd files) and display the folder as a mod on the Load Mods menu.  So, if you don't want to put everything into a pk4 file, you can create a directory "euro" at the same level as your "base" directory and then drop the files in there, unzipped.  When you run Doom 3 and select "Load Mods", you should see the euro directory listed.  Load the mod and you're ready to go.
<br /><br />Or, of course, you can also create a shortcut w/ "+fs_game euro" in it... <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121123357im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />G</div>]]></body></post><post id="p70533" date="Posted: Wed Jan 05, 2005 9:35 am "><author>Spanner</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">For anyone whose interested I've made a set of skybox day/night textures that are cloudless/sunless - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121123357/http://members.iinet.net.au/~nc_hall/spanner_sky.zip" class="postlink">spanner_sky.zip - 2.7MB</a>.
