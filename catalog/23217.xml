Now, I'm not sure what you mean by making a 'game' from it.  It already is a game...in the style of the Thief series, we just haven't created a campaign with a storyline.  We provided some missions at the time of release, and are continuing to release new missions as they are completed.  If you are talking about taking our work and building a completely different game on top of it...then you would be talking about a 'mod of a mod'.  The focus was on creating a 'toolset' full of usable assets, and our customized version of GTK radiant, "Dark Radiant".  As with anything, coding/scripting can be used but is not an absolute necessity.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p220841" date="Posted: Thu Dec 03, 2009 8:07 am "><author>shaily</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Hi,<br /><br />The Dark Mod 1.00 has released and i was not knowing.None of my friends also told me about this.<br />I heard from few guys who were having gossip.I heard that its really awesome to play this mode.<br />Tell me how this mode works,i want to try as i am a lover of games.<br /><br />Please tell me buddies.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p220860" date="Posted: Fri Dec 04, 2009 12:11 am "><author>AO</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Congrats guys, one of the mods I remember the most while doing mods myself in the early days of Doom 3 modding.

The mod is just a beta right now, so there are still several minor bugs and incomplete features.  We'll probably be putting out updates every month or two for the first year.  The first update will include several new characters that weren't quite ready for this release.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p219685" date="Posted: Sun Oct 18, 2009 12:15 am "><author>Ivan_the_B</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Congratulations for the release!<br />I'm downloading it right now. ^^<br /><br />Btw you should edit your news on moddb and add a couple of images and a big red dl link.<br />Otherwise they probably won't put it in the flash bar on the homepage.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225043224im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p219687" date="Posted: Sun Oct 18, 2009 12:41 am "><author>parsonsbear</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">seeding</div>]]></body></post><post id="p219695" date="Posted: Sun Oct 18, 2009 12:02 pm "><author>Hexen Terzo</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">A normal link for download?

And does it require coding/scripting?</div><br /><br />We designed the mod as a way to make 'Thief' inspired fan missions.  It's a total conversion of the Doom 3 engine.  Now, I'm not sure what you mean by making a 'game' from it.  It already is a game...in the style of the Thief series, we just haven't created a campaign with a storyline.  We provided some missions at the time of release, and are continuing to release new missions as they are completed.  If you are talking about taking our work and building a completely different game on top of it...then you would be talking about a 'mod of a mod'.  The focus was on creating a 'toolset' full of usable assets, and our customized version of GTK radiant, "Dark Radiant".

For those interested, the first non-team member missions are starting to pour in (four in the last week or two).
