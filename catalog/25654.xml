There are hundreds of megabytes of custom textures, maps, models, moveables, etc. that work as a cohesive whole and can be licensed conveniently as a block. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319221135/http://www.gamefront.com/files/21033111/spatiality_zip" class="postlink">this</a> has already been released, but there is more. I have the full intention of releasing these under a libre license (probably "do what the fuck you want") but for a few reasons; there are minor bits of scripts etc. that I need permission from the authors to re-license. Also if no one is interested in taking this on as a project I may just keep developing it for doom 3 until the "mod" is ready and then release the assets. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Reclamation</span><br />The goal is to create a clean base mod using only custom assets so as to be able to eventually go standalone. Ambitious for one person, but the idea is that if people like the work they can join in the effort, or just as good, release their assets free so everyone including me can use them. This mod or TC if you will is to be a sort of blank canvas "Gary's Mod" with assets all under some permissive license to encourage use.<br /><br />My passion is the idea of a fully open source shooter. That needs a pool of assets. This is my contribution to the pool.<br /><br />Current status is about 100mb of assets including textures, models, moveables, etc. <br />The mod was previously listed here [url]viewtopic.php?f=39&amp;t=22395&amp;p=210663[/url] but it has moved so far along that it now retains only the name, so I made a new thread. <br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319221135/http://s247.beta.photobucket.com/user/whitewolfw2/media/id%20tech%20mapping/11_9_12_no2.jpg.html" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319221135im_/http://i247.photobucket.com/albums/gg159/whitewolfw2/id%20tech%20mapping/th_11_9_12_no2.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319221135/http://s247.beta.photobucket.com/user/whitewolfw2/media/id%20tech%20mapping/reclamation_11.jpg.html" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319221135im_/http://i247.photobucket.com/albums/gg159/whitewolfw2/id%20tech%20mapping/th_reclamation_11.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319221135/http://s247.beta.photobucket.com/user/whitewolfw2/media/id%20tech%20mapping/11_9_12_no1.jpg.html" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319221135im_/http://i247.photobucket.com/albums/gg159/whitewolfw2/id%20tech%20mapping/th_11_9_12_no1.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319221135/http://s247.beta.photobucket.com/user/whitewolfw2/media/id%20tech%20mapping/shot00003.jpg.html" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319221135im_/http://i247.photobucket.com/albums/gg159/whitewolfw2/id%20tech%20mapping/th_shot00003.jpg" alt="Image" /></a></div>]]></body></post><post id="p240489" date="Posted: Wed Jul 04, 2012 5:32 pm "><author>whitewolf</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Vertex painting and a lighting switch up. <br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319221135/http://s247.photobucket.com/albums/gg159/whitewolfw2/?action=view&amp;current=shot00018.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319221135im_/http://i247.photobucket.com/albums/gg159/whitewolfw2/th_shot00018.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319221135/http://s247.photobucket.com/albums/gg159/whitewolfw2/?action=view&amp;current=shot00019.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319221135im_/http://i247.photobucket.com/albums/gg159/whitewolfw2/th_shot00019.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319221135/http://s247.photobucket.com/albums/gg159/whitewolfw2/?action=view&amp;current=shot00020.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319221135im_/http://i247.photobucket.com/albums/gg159/whitewolfw2/th_shot00020.jpg" alt="Image" /></a></div>]]></body></post><post id="p240490" date="Posted: Wed Jul 04, 2012 6:47 pm "><author>The Happy Friar</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Ha!
