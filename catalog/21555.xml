The "cause a mess" button?  No, you _can_ use it, so long as you do a few simple things.  First you should use a big grid, avoid unusual angles.  Any Radiant (or brush editor) is supposed to work along 8x8 grid as (practically) the minimum, I've read even basing most brushes on a 16x16 grid has benefits over 8x8.  So it makes sense that anything existing within less than 8 units would be considered "iffy" and you can't go CSGin' your name into a brush with 1-unit thick brushes in some cursive italics.<br />I believe all this has a lot more to do with vis calculations than anything though, in which case any finer brushes (CSG result or not) (especially in idTech4 titles) should be made func_static or something, because in the old days all of that could be "made detail" and excluded from vis calculations in BSP compile.  Detailed, small and sparkly CSG subtractions on structural brushes would screw over even a simple boxmap.  Also, it's a wise idea to select what you've carved up with CSG piece by piece manually, and export it as a prefab or something and "load" it back into your map.  It's a bit of cleaning process in my experience, simply reloading manually selected stuff and leaving behind any "phantom brushes" that can cause issues.<br /><br />So yeah, simple angles, big chunks of brushes, manual select export and reload, exclude from vis calculations = CSG operations aren't so evil after all.
