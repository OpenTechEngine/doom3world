(NO ACTUAL IMPS INSIDE)</title><posts><post id="p204556" date="Posted: Fri Sep 05, 2008 2:25 am "><author>Douglas Quaid</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Hey guys <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121081309im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> Hope everyone is ok. I'm trying to find out about editing monster skins these days but I need somebody to point me in the right direction because I'm new to texturing. Could someone give me a hint as to where to go for this specific type of tutorial as I don't know the definite texture thread for monster skinning. Thanks<br /><br />P.S My apologies if this is in the wrong area but the search is acting up for some reason...</div>]]></body></post><post id="p204557" date="Posted: Fri Sep 05, 2008 3:31 am "><author>bhenderson</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I came in here hoping I could see an imp wearing a hawaiian shirt and jeans. :[</div>]]></body></post><post id="p204558" date="Posted: Fri Sep 05, 2008 5:43 am "><author>Brain Trepaning</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">"SKin" refers to changing the material via a bit of code, swapping one material Def for another. You have to create the texture, create the MTR for the texture, and create a .SKIN file for the swap to take place. I have a SKIN tutorial on my website, if you want to do the download and watch it. All in all, there is no reason an Imp cannot be wearing a Hawaiian shirt within 10 minutes.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p204559" date="Posted: Fri Sep 05, 2008 10:06 am "><author>6th Venom</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">There are tons of reasons an IMP should not...  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121081309im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p204563" date="Posted: Fri Sep 05, 2008 1:46 pm "><author>Douglas Quaid</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">ok thanks brian, I'll give it a try.

The best way to do it would be to grab a "shirt-form" of triangles from the Imp and duplicate them, then scale them out to rest on top of the low-poly mesh, so they can share the same rigging and animations, and look more convincing as sitting on top of the Imp's body, with lower parts of the shirt being able to hang and dangle.  All those guys have worked very hard, they deserve a tropical holiday.  Maybe this could be turned into a bit of a contest?
