I'm not talking about <span style="font-style: italic">creating</span> normal maps, more about just using existing normal maps (such as those for Doom3 models). I have used Max7 up to this point and Max7 handles normal maps as a variant of 'bump' - a standard feature. It works very well.
<br /><br />I've recently decided to get into Lightwave for a number of work-related reasons and a by-product of that is that I can finally import those lovely .lwo objects from the extracted Doom3 model directories and save them down as .obj files with UV mapping for import to Max7, but I cannot find any reference in any of the LW9 manuals or online tutorials that LW9 actually has any facility to deal with normal mapping natively.
<br /><br />1. Does LW refer to normal mapping as 'displacement' - is this where I'm getting confused?
<br /><br />2. How come some Doom3 models I load into LW9 (from my extracted directories) sometimes show a normal map texture, but I can't find any parameters to actually apply it as a normal map?
<br /><br />Sorry to be such an idiot. Any help would be really gratefully appreciated.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p167662" date="Posted: Wed Jan 17, 2007 4:16 pm "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">If I remember correctly LightWave can use a normal map as a bump stage, not as displacement map (these would be still black and white).</div>]]></body></post><post id="p167665" date="Posted: Wed Jan 17, 2007 6:06 pm "><author>Dogstar</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">BNA! wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">If I remember correctly LightWave can use a normal map as a bump stage, not as displacement map (these would be still black and white).</div>
