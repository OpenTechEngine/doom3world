<br />Der-Ton's exporter works fine for single mesh only <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><br />I have model that splited on pieces (body, helmet, face, shoulders pads, weapon, etc.) and it's already rigged and animated. I need to export it to MD5, but der_ton's exporter fails to do so <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> And I can't have single mesh due to specific work flow.
<br />Thanks.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p166825" date="Posted: Mon Jan 08, 2007 5:20 pm "><author>6th Venom</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I think there is another one that do it, but as far as i can remember, you can only export 1 standard material (no multi materials) with it, can't remember the name...
<br /><br />You should definitivly rework your model, just "attach" all members to the body, and reskin it to your animated bones.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p166826" date="Posted: Mon Jan 08, 2007 5:22 pm "><author>der_ton</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Berserker's exporter is what you're looking for (linked to in the tools sticky thread in the Modeling&amp;Animation subforum):

<br /><br />der_ton,
<br />Can you general MD5 exporter export animated flag (cloth simulation in both MAX or/and Blender) to MD5 even if flag has no bones?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p166842" date="Posted: Mon Jan 08, 2007 6:51 pm "><author>der_ton</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">motorsep wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Can you general MD5 exporter export animated flag (cloth simulation in both MAX or/and Blender) to MD5 even if flag has no bones?</div>
<br />Yes, that's what it is about, animations that don't use bones but any method.
<br />It only exists for 3dsmax, by the way.</div>]]></body></post></posts></thread></xml>
