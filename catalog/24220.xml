The image is kind of shaking quite often. You can see this effect on this video <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319222817/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUohifAbPW0" class="postlink">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUohifAbPW0</a> (00:05, 00:19) . I don't touch keyboard and mouse. It happens on default doom and drivers settings as well as on my custom settings. I remember I played Doom 3 before and this problem didn't occur. I recorded this video on freshly installed system. It does not happen in any other game. I tried 1.3 and 1.3.1 patch, the problem occurs on both.<br /><br />Can you help me?:)<br /><br />Windows XP SP2 (also happens on SP3)<br />GeForce 9800GT 1GB (266.58, also happened on older versions)<br />Core 2 Duo E7400 2.8GHz<br />4GB Ram<br />MB: MSI Neo-F<br />Creative X-Fi Xtreme Gamer</div>]]></body></post><post id="p229709" date="Posted: Fri Feb 11, 2011 2:43 pm "><author>The Happy Friar</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">hair in the laser area of the mouse?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p229710" date="Posted: Fri Feb 11, 2011 2:51 pm "><author>kwazar84</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">hair in the laser area of the mouse?</div><br />No hair.

The shake I'm talking about is very rapid, you can see it in 5th and 19th second of my video.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p229715" date="Posted: Fri Feb 11, 2011 4:21 pm "><author>Sikkpin</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I just checked it out and I get the same twitching.
