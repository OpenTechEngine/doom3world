Issue was Windows ITSELF, no hardware or 3rd party software.  I proved that with a linux install that worked great.<br /><br />all you can do is find the folders where the windows updates are stored (Win XP is c:\windows\).  In Xp the folders are labeled "$NtUninstallKB873339$".  $NTUninstall is in front of them all.  KB##### is the update #.  When you find those folders, sort by date/time, then find the latest update.  Uninstall that one.  Reboot.  See if problem continues.<br /><br />Repeat until you work again.  But if auto-updates is turned on you'll never know as it will automatically update when you log in.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081118041829im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  So make sure those are turned off!  Plus, I've had issues when if updates X wasn't installed, update Y would break the system (uggggggggggggggggg).  So I stopped getting updates for 2k years ago (maybe 4 or 5).<br /><br />I'd write down the updates you uninstall, just so you know which one to NOT install.  Also, those folders are normally hidden, so do whatever hoops Vista requires you to go through to get those to show.<br /><br />BTW, for me it was a required update that did this (single to multi-core update when I popped in a X2), so I had to re-install XP anyway.<br /><br />If you use multiple browsers &amp; keep some exclusive for some things (I only use IE for things that require IE), you may even noticed sites from the others history loading.
