<br /><br />Also, this is a common thing when you have Nimo Codec Pack installed, do you have that?
<br /><br />In that case just uninstall it and restart the computer and it should work =)</div>]]></body></post><post id="p29113" date="Posted: Thu Aug 05, 2004 9:31 pm "><author>OldRod</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">WMP Plays it ok.  Not sure about the Nimo codec - don't ever remember installing that one <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100522162536im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Good video!
<br /><br />A question though.  In Quake editing (and Quake2 as well I think) you had to make sure that moving entities did not go outside the bounds of the map or you'd have a leak.  In your example, if you move the Door in the '270' direction, it'll move outside the map.  Does that not cause a leak in Doom3?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p29120" date="Posted: Thu Aug 05, 2004 9:38 pm "><author>MNeMiC</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Well, you can probably adjust this, but with this entity, it will BY DEFAULT! stop when its a certain amount of percentage left of the door to 'slide in the wall', if you get what I mean, it will automaticly stop so that not the whole door will dissapear. So, in the end this wall will partitially be in 'space' and some part of it inside of the level, I'm not sure about what happens when you have it fully move outside.
<br /><br />However! I did have this small incident when I was experimenting with a door earlier, I tried to make it as a func_train thing kinda, but when I placed a target outside of the map it wouldn't compile, so I think that you might be right.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p29146" date="Posted: Thu Aug 05, 2004 10:35 pm "><author>MrTrip</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">*sighs* becoming more and more complicated...argh...I will figure it out someday though...</div>]]></body></post><post id="p29151" date="Posted: Thu Aug 05, 2004 10:47 pm "><author>MNeMiC</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">MrTrip wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">*sighs* becoming more and more complicated...argh...I will figure it out someday though...</div>

<br /><br />Door in a nutshell:
<br /><br />Draw out a brush
<br />Right Click &gt; func &gt; func_door
<br />Press N
<br />Type "movedir" for the KEY, then click on the direction you want it to move (180 = west, 360/0 = east, 90 = north, 270=south).
<br />Type "time" for the KEY, type 2 (time in seconds for door to slide open) for the value, press return.
<br />Type "lip" for the KEY, type 8 or whatever for the value, press return.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p41813" date="Posted: Wed Aug 25, 2004 8:45 pm "><author>MNeMiC</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">*UPDATE! WITH AUDIO!*
