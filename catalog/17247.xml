<br />The final Doom3 version that came out appeared to be a retarded crap. This
<br />mod is here to change things. Play the way you want not the way ID wanted
<br />you to "play". No more irritating monsters that push you to the corner
<br />and hit your hud, no more boring pda with shitty stories about AI that
<br />saw a "scary" polygon. Imagine you're a Sam Fisher and stalk your enemies
<br />or use the devastating force to kill them like Rambo.

<br /><br /><br />i just tried it,  it's 100% legit.  
<br /><br />re: regulator
<br /><br />it seems to mess with the level scripts?  I tried part of the cpu level &amp; kept getting errors with strings &amp; scripts in he console.  Love the way the plasma works now though.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205223658im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p157620" date="Posted: Wed Sep 20, 2006 12:30 pm "><author>Regulator</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">The Happy Friar wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">re: regulatorit seems to mess with the level scripts?

And in some levels the doors are locked like in Central Processing [CPU Boss] and in some are unlocked [Administration] so you can enter the room where swan and bodyguard is. I will have to remove those locked doors probably. And plasma weapon punches enemies somehow, I tried to find whats causing this, but could not find and left as it is. Also forgot to mention theres blood splat optimization now when you hit monster with a gun.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157628" date="Posted: Wed Sep 20, 2006 3:27 pm "><author>Hexen Terzo</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thank's for your mod in D3, i'm in download  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205223658im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p157678" date="Posted: Thu Sep 21, 2006 6:10 am "><author>Tetzlaff</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Imp and Hell Knight don´t have a ranged attack anymore, chaingun commando and vagary walk slower?

And some monsters walk/attack slower to improve the gameplay, because you can evade and reload now. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205223658im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p157704" date="Posted: Thu Sep 21, 2006 3:42 pm "><author>Kristus</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Regulator wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"> because it was planned lol obvious. </div>

To stop some monsters attacking from far away, because I thought pauses in combat give more depth to gameplay. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205223658im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8)" title="Cool" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p157710" date="Posted: Thu Sep 21, 2006 4:41 pm "><author>Kristus</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Being able to kill the Hellknight with a pistol because it's too far away to attack you isn't what I consider depth.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157712" date="Posted: Thu Sep 21, 2006 4:48 pm "><author>Regulator</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Kristus wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Being able to kill the Hellknight with a pistol because it's too far away to attack you isn't what I consider depth.</div>Hellnight is not physically challenged, he can chase the player too, you know.

<br /><br />What he is saying is that if there is anything that prevents the Hellknight from standing next to you you could take him out with the pistol provided you have enough ammo. Personally I would do it as I would rather use up pistol ammo than anything else.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157736" date="Posted: Thu Sep 21, 2006 10:15 pm "><author>Regulator</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">So whats wrong with using pistol against Hellnight?
