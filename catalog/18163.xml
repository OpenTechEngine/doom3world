<br /><br />It is, currently a Quake 4 map, because i better like the Quake4 level editor, however, the final version of this map going to be for doom3. I guess it would be possible to open this map in doom3 with some small modifications(removing a monster).
<br /><br />All textures are made by me of various sources, you can read more about these texturese here:

<br /><br />The most important thing is: Lighting. Go to work on the lighting. The first shot has some seriously overlit stuff, and the last shot I thought was a practical joke because all I see is black.
<br /><br />The textures look very good, keep up the good work.
<br />Work on the geometry, it all looks very blocky and basic, try working not only on small details, but designing some of the areas with more feel for complex architecture. For example some support beams inside the mine would make it look more real, and more detailed.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p165144" date="Posted: Wed Dec 20, 2006 11:42 am "><author>dcreator</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks for such a great reply... Lightning, I wouldn't think that the first shots lightning is over lighted, if you look at the gun, its not that light?
<br /><br />It might probably look like that because of the brushed steel pipes is very specular. 
<br /><br />The darkest image, got a light level with a brightness of 16 or something, it is supposed to be nearly pitch black there, but only for 5-10 meters or something, because it is going to be a " T " connection or something with a monster waiting there to attack the player.
<br /><br />Support beams, you mean like pillars and stuff? I think it would look better with some pillars around in the big rooms?
<br /><br />Anyway, I've too look at the lightning and design of the original q4 maps, to get inspiration, and find proper ways to do good lightning.
<br /><br />I've planned it to be like:
<br />1st floor: Light, with some small offices, a  lunchroom, showers and rooms. Possible to look at the outside of mines.
