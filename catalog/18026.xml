<br />Good brushwork and a good choose of textures!
<br />Just add a little bit more detail to that scene and improve the lighting.

<br /><br />You seem to have a good feeling for texturing.
<br /><br />Don't mind the typical beginner mistakes like too much colored lighting and the box map layout.
<br /><br />It's natural to start this exact way, but you're already one step ahead by using textures in a consistent and appropriately scaled manner.
<br /><br />I'd say - keep this as is and head right into your next map!
<br /><br />Don't try to build a full map, don't feel pressed to release something!

<br /><br />I've started on several unfinished maps so far, 10 maps or something... I personally am quite satisfied with this theme, so I wish to finish it, eventually. Along the way, when it's built up some more, I'll try to learn scripting and such.. AI control, elevators, teleporting, and so on.

<br />I don't know how far you have figured out how the light editor works but
<br />try to work with the light centre in the light editor. 
<br /><br />So far from my side <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p163984" date="Posted: Wed Dec 06, 2006 9:17 pm "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I think it's a good start.
<br /><br />You seem to have a good feeling for texturing.
<br /><br />Don't mind the typical beginner mistakes like too much colored lighting and the box map layout.
<br /><br />It's natural to start this exact way, but you're already one step ahead by using textures in a consistent and appropriately scaled manner.
<br /><br />I'd say - keep this as is and head right into your next map!
<br /><br />Don't try to build a full map, don't feel pressed to release something!
<br />Build rooms, try out various concepts and then a full map will form in your head and bang - 6 weeks later you're there with a decent product!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p163985" date="Posted: Wed Dec 06, 2006 9:32 pm "><author>NGX</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks for the tips.

<br />Good brushwork and a good choose of textures!
<br />Just add a little bit more detail to that scene and improve the lighting. 
<br />For example the area around the light at the door should be brighter than the rest. Think of a light cone that is starting from each light source.
