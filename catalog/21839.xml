If you can move the mappings of the different objects (in your application's UV editor) away from each other so that they don't overlap, and scale the new UV-layout back to fit into the 0,0-&gt;1,1 range, you're alread half done. Then you need to construct your merged texture according to where you moved your formerly different models' UV-spaces.<br /><br />It's not a 1-button merge, but I don't think it is a complicated process. One problem might be if one of your models use texture wrapping, this will make it difficult because the new texture can't be wrapped at the borders.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p203320" date="Posted: Thu Aug 07, 2008 10:17 pm "><author>Hostyle</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">You mean I should select a mesh object inside the mesh, then move it to somewhere in the my new merged texture position and do it with all other objects included in the mesh?

If this is the case then don't ask other people to do the work for you. If it's not then I guess you'll have to find someone to do 3D stuff for you who is willing to give you a lot of spare time.<br /><br />The problem you are having is not a big one, it does however require you to actually do some work to fix it. Even though Max's tools are great for doing lots of stuff automatically, for game models you need to put some manual labor into it.<br /><br />The render to texture tool is not that hard to use. You just need to select the method the channels to use and the outputs. The method will be either with or without projection. The channels will be your uv channel that you assigned the map to end up on. And of course the outputs will be whichever textures you want output and where.<br /><br />But of course even before any render to texture will work out properly for you, you need to have the model and it's uv's ready to go.<br /><br />In your case you have the same model that you already have and you just need to make some new uv's that will cover a single map. Whether you take the existing uv's and restructure them or make completely new ones, it does not matter. But this step is important and without you'll have trouble. Restructuring existing uv's is probably the fastest and preferred way if they are good uv's to begin with. So you can try the pack tool and see how it works for you or do it manually, or both, use the pack and then adjust it manually. After this is done it becomes real easy to render out the textures from the other model using render to texture.<br /><br />The render to texture tool usually doesn't take that much to set up. You select your new model, press "0" and then enable "Projection Mapping" and pick your old model objects that you want to render from. The only thing you need to check then is the cage. You can "reset" the cage in the projection modifier and then push it out evenly to cover the model. Since they are the same model, this would be a pretty small amount. The one thing you may have to do to prevent some black pixels showing up is to use a push modifier on one of the two models and push it by something like 0.01 amount. This prevents having some exact overlapping faces which can on occasion cause to render the wrong pixel. This is only necessary when using the exact same two models. If one is turbo smoothed or something, it's obviously not needed because they will be different.<br /><br />So after that stuff you just make the channel 1 because you're projecting you should be using channel 1 anyway. If you're not, then make it 1 on the model before hand. Also make sure it's on "Use Existing Channel". Then choose your outputs.<br /><br />If this does not work for you then you need to write down in exact detail what steps you follow to get the texture rendered. This of course only if you're interested in learning to do this for yourself. I think though that when you get it rendered you will see that it's a pretty simple procedure.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p203467" date="Posted: Sun Aug 10, 2008 1:15 pm "><author>Hostyle</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">obihb wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Ok, well it looks to me like you're at least a bit interested in doing some 3D.

They will sometimes give you exactly what you expect but a lot of times it just won't work correctly. There is not a specific fix or workaround for this. The best you can do is make sure the mesh is clean and welded, no holes or open edges.<br /><br />When creating models for games it's better to work on it manually. Although boolean can save time in some cases, it's more likely it will cause more problems that needs fixing and waste more time than it can save. The reason is just because that game models needs to be clean and efficient models. Automatic mesh cutting and joining tools will not give you clean results.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p203719" date="Posted: Fri Aug 15, 2008 4:40 pm "><author>Hostyle</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Hey, I just tried it again today and it worked!!!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081204031109im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />  Omg I can't believe it I'm two steps away from exporting it.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081204031109im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /><br />edit:<br />It shows up in-game, yay!<br />Thanks to everyone!!!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p203235" date="Posted: Wed Aug 06, 2008 9:18 pm "><author>Hostyle</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Is there a plugin for any programs or tool, [preferably 3ds Max] for texture merging?

You mean I should use material channels or something?</div><br />The basic problem that you are trying to solve is that you have several meshes with UV-mapping that each map to separate textures but are all in the 0,0 -&gt; 1,1 rectangle, right? If you can move the mappings of the different objects (in your application's UV editor) away from each other so that they don't overlap, and scale the new UV-layout back to fit into the 0,0-&gt;1,1 range, you're alread half done. Then you need to construct your merged texture according to where you moved your formerly different models' UV-spaces.<br /><br />It's not a 1-button merge, but I don't think it is a complicated process. One problem might be if one of your models use texture wrapping, this will make it difficult because the new texture can't be wrapped at the borders.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p203320" date="Posted: Thu Aug 07, 2008 10:17 pm "><author>Hostyle</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">You mean I should select a mesh object inside the mesh, then move it to somewhere in the my new merged texture position and do it with all other objects included in the mesh?

If this is the case then don't ask other people to do the work for you. If it's not then I guess you'll have to find someone to do 3D stuff for you who is willing to give you a lot of spare time.<br /><br />The problem you are having is not a big one, it does however require you to actually do some work to fix it. Even though Max's tools are great for doing lots of stuff automatically, for game models you need to put some manual labor into it.<br /><br />The render to texture tool is not that hard to use. You just need to select the method the channels to use and the outputs. The method will be either with or without projection. The channels will be your uv channel that you assigned the map to end up on. And of course the outputs will be whichever textures you want output and where.<br /><br />But of course even before any render to texture will work out properly for you, you need to have the model and it's uv's ready to go.<br /><br />In your case you have the same model that you already have and you just need to make some new uv's that will cover a single map. Whether you take the existing uv's and restructure them or make completely new ones, it does not matter. But this step is important and without you'll have trouble. Restructuring existing uv's is probably the fastest and preferred way if they are good uv's to begin with. So you can try the pack tool and see how it works for you or do it manually, or both, use the pack and then adjust it manually. After this is done it becomes real easy to render out the textures from the other model using render to texture.<br /><br />The render to texture tool usually doesn't take that much to set up. You select your new model, press "0" and then enable "Projection Mapping" and pick your old model objects that you want to render from. The only thing you need to check then is the cage. You can "reset" the cage in the projection modifier and then push it out evenly to cover the model. Since they are the same model, this would be a pretty small amount. The one thing you may have to do to prevent some black pixels showing up is to use a push modifier on one of the two models and push it by something like 0.01 amount. This prevents having some exact overlapping faces which can on occasion cause to render the wrong pixel. This is only necessary when using the exact same two models. If one is turbo smoothed or something, it's obviously not needed because they will be different.<br /><br />So after that stuff you just make the channel 1 because you're projecting you should be using channel 1 anyway. If you're not, then make it 1 on the model before hand. Also make sure it's on "Use Existing Channel". Then choose your outputs.<br /><br />If this does not work for you then you need to write down in exact detail what steps you follow to get the texture rendered. This of course only if you're interested in learning to do this for yourself. I think though that when you get it rendered you will see that it's a pretty simple procedure.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p203467" date="Posted: Sun Aug 10, 2008 1:15 pm "><author>Hostyle</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">obihb wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Ok, well it looks to me like you're at least a bit interested in doing some 3D.
