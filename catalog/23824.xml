No need to anything special, it should create the "Debug_Dedicated" folder and the WolfDED.exe in here.<br /><br />Now change the "Debug Dedicated" mode in the drop-down list and change it to "Release", here same principle, the "Release" folder should be created and the WolfMP.exe should appear in here along the dlls.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">* RTCW SP</span><br />Same kind of manipulation here, except that there's no dedicated stuff:<br />1. Generate the whole =&gt; 2 errors should appear<br />2. Go to the "extractfuncs" folder and execute "extractfuncs.bat"<br />3. Generate again the solution, the WolfSP + its dlls should be created in the Debug folder (or Release given your project mode)<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">* ET</span><br />Nothing special here, just generate the whole...<br /><br />I hope that it helped, I think your problem is due to DirectX...<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Edit:</span> to be more precise, it requires DirectInput &amp; DirectSound libraries (that are contained in the SDK), as seen in the "wolf" project &gt; header files &gt; win_local.h, you have those lines:<br />#include &lt;dinput.h&gt;<br />#include &lt;dsound.h&gt;</div>]]></body></post><post id="p226324" date="Posted: Fri Aug 13, 2010 1:53 pm "><author>Neurological</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thank you, if I'm not wong the Platform SDK is included with the VC++ 2008 right?
