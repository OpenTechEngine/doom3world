I just installed it, and I haven't had that much time to check out the new stuff, but right now I am about to check out the new "Poly-Painting" tool, and see if I can transfer it to my UV Map.
<br /><br />Here is a screenshot I took of ZBrush3 Running with one of my models in the viewport ^_^.

My favorite thing about it is if you have a problem with your UV Map even after all the painting work you've already done, you can go back to Maya (or whatever you use), re-edit your UV map, then take it back to ZBrush and replace the old UV Map with the fixed new one, then re-apply the color with no problems.<br /><br />I've already had to do that  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" />. You can also get some pretty decent skin out of it. Just check out what this guy did, he claims it was all PolyPaint (make sure and click the link to the hi-res image, it looks really good): <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.zbrushcentral.com/zbc/showthread.php?t=048743">http://www.zbrushcentral.com/zbc/showth ... p?t=048743</a><!-- m --></div>]]></body></post><post id="p178487" date="Posted: Fri May 18, 2007 9:05 pm "><author>Hostyle</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Check out the interface:

My favorite thing about it is if you have a problem with your UV Map even after all the painting work you've already done, you can go back to Maya (or whatever you use), re-edit your UV map, then take it back to ZBrush and replace the old UV Map with the fixed new one, then re-apply the color with no problems.<br /><br />I've already had to do that  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205070249im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" />. You can also get some pretty decent skin out of it.

My favorite thing about it is if you have a problem with your UV Map even after all the painting work you've already done, you can go back to Maya (or whatever you use), re-edit your UV map, then take it back to ZBrush and replace the old UV Map with the fixed new one, then re-apply the color with no problems.<br /><br />I've already had to do that  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" />. You can also get some pretty decent skin out of it.

I just installed it, and I haven't had that much time to check out the new stuff, but right now I am about to check out the new "Poly-Painting" tool, and see if I can transfer it to my UV Map.
<br /><br />Here is a screenshot I took of ZBrush3 Running with one of my models in the viewport ^_^.

My favorite thing about it is if you have a problem with your UV Map even after all the painting work you've already done, you can go back to Maya (or whatever you use), re-edit your UV map, then take it back to ZBrush and replace the old UV Map with the fixed new one, then re-apply the color with no problems.<br /><br />I've already had to do that  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" />. You can also get some pretty decent skin out of it.

My favorite thing about it is if you have a problem with your UV Map even after all the painting work you've already done, you can go back to Maya (or whatever you use), re-edit your UV map, then take it back to ZBrush and replace the old UV Map with the fixed new one, then re-apply the color with no problems.<br /><br />I've already had to do that  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" />. You can also get some pretty decent skin out of it.

<br /><br />Odd... I remember I posted my pic because I didn't see any pics of ZBrush running in here... Maybe the image didn't load when I looked in here... /shrug.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p184372" date="Posted: Tue Jul 24, 2007 2:32 am "><author>revility</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">just got myself the upgrade.

My favorite thing about it is if you have a problem with your UV Map even after all the painting work you've already done, you can go back to Maya (or whatever you use), re-edit your UV map, then take it back to ZBrush and replace the old UV Map with the fixed new one, then re-apply the color with no problems.<br /><br />I've already had to do that  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" />. You can also get some pretty decent skin out of it. Just check out what this guy did, he claims it was all PolyPaint (make sure and click the link to the hi-res image, it looks really good): <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.zbrushcentral.com/zbc/showthread.php?t=048743">http://www.zbrushcentral.com/zbc/showth ... p?t=048743</a><!-- m --></div>]]></body></post></posts></thread></xml>
