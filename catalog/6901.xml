<br/><br/>
Outdated info:&#13;
<br/>
With a bit of a delay, finally here it is:&#13;
<br/><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://home.tiscali.de/der_ton/blender-md5importer.zip" target="_blank">http://home.tiscali.de/der_ton/blender-md5importer.zip</a>&#13;
<br/>
Based on an importer by Bob Holcomb, that had the mesh import working. I modified it to handle MD5 version 10, and added the skeleton import (which turned out to be quite non-trivial) and vertex group generation.&#13;
<br/><br/>
It doesn't import md5anims currently.&#13;
<br/><br/>
How to:&#13;
<br/>
Start the script, select the md5mesh file and press "Import".&#13;
<br/>
After the import, the meshes will not be parented to the armature yet.&#13;
<br/>
You have to do that manually since there is currently no way to &#13;
<br/>
do that with a python script.&#13;
<br/>
Parent it like this:&#13;
<br/>
- select a mesh&#13;
<br/>
- shift-select the armature (both the mesh and the armature should be&#13;
<br/>
  highlighted, but the armature has a slightly brighter color)&#13;
<br/>
- press CTRL-P. Select "Armature" from the upcoming dialog, in the next&#13;
<br/>
  dialog press "Don't create vertex groups".&#13;
<br/>
- repeat this for each mesh that the model consists of&#13;
<br/><br/>
If vertices don't move with the armature, you probably have forgotten to parent&#13;
<br/>
the mesh to the armature.&#13;

<br />I am curious. Currently, I am creating only static meshes for Doom 3 with Blender (it is going well, thanks to Kat!), and no MD5 models yet.

There is a section in there though that runs you through how to assign a texture to a material and a material to a mesh.

<br /><br />There's a BVH importer script by Bob Holcomb, that's a format used in motioncapturing mostly. If you can export your animation to BVH then you should be able to import it into Blender, if everything goes well.
