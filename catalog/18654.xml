<br />just a few crits though;
<br /><br />its hard to tell if they are or not because of the small screens but I think the trees would look better structurely if the floating leaves were connected to the rest of the tree, could you post some bigger screens?
<br /><br />I think the bottom of the grass texture is too dark for the colour of the ground making them stand out too much and not realy blend in with the whole picture
