Any of you played any Metal Gear games? Notice that when you get stuck and don't know what to do, you can call your superiors on the "codec" and they give you helpful tips. What about a similar system, but minus the codec and the superiors? Picture the situation:<br />Players enter a room, where they find several switches and several doors. The switches have several weird symbols written on them. So have the doors. The players dont get what to do, so each of them presses the "say idea" button, which is conveniently mapped to the Q key on the keyboard. This will make the players' characters say out loud what they think should be done. For instance, an Archeologist character might refer to the strange scroll with similar lettering the party found earlier, and suggest that the player holding it would try desciphering the symbols on the walls, using the scroll with the code on. Such codes could be randomized every time the game restarts, and with render-to-texture technology, the symbols on the switches and similar contraptions can also be altered. No direct solutions to the problem are given, but mere hints to what the players should try. Different characters with different acquired skills should say different things in situations as this. I will need many voice actors.<br /><br />Now about "disconnecting player". If a player does disconnect without wanting to, all his things are dropped to the ground, and can be shared amongst the party of adventurers. His "magic skills" are left visualised as objects, such as crystal orbs, or floating lights. All these can be picked up and used by other players, so they can progress through the level even suffering the loss of an important character with vital skills to the current quest. <br /><br />Players suffer different "death" depending on type of damage they were dealt. Players killed by monsters in combat, may be revived later by either a medic, or by a magic ritual. Players slain by wicked magics return to the party as semi-visible ghosts, with several new abilities and drawbacks: seeing invisible monsters, being able to posess friendly characters for benefits, casting special spells, etc.<br /><br />Can Doom3/Q4 do this?<br />Few monsters, Co-Op with 3-5 players? Fairly large indoor/cave/underground/dungeon enviros?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p192212" date="Posted: Tue Dec 04, 2007 3:00 pm "><author>zenarion</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Posted on several other sites, to ask for crits and suggestions.
