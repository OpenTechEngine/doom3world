I had alot of fun creating the Shambler and had to make one of my other favourite monsters from Quake, the Demon. It's also pink.. hehee. I'm pretty sure most people will recognise this little critter. I actually wanted to make him first but decided on the Shambler because he could be used as a boss, the Demon can't.
<br /><br />As you can see it's still early days for the model. The gray part of course being my place holder for shape purpose. I'm taking a very different approuch with this model in the sense of creating detail as I go along. Usually I would create a full character before doing any details. This way I don't get tired of just having to do one thing or another and can balance out the detail with less frustration, working on smaller parts at a time.

I love how everyone's learning how to do everything now- we're going to have to market ourselves as scripters/animators/mappers/2d artists/modelers/level designers.
<br /><br />It's hard to tell what it'll look like posed. But judging by these two renders, I think its head needs to be a bit lower.  Perhaps the shoulder blades should be rotated forwards towards the chest, as well. That way it'll be nicely hump-backed and tortured looking. I also wonder if the hips shouldn't be narrower.

<br /><br />Some new screens with a more complete mesh. I'm still in tweak mode with this mesh so stuff might change a little or alot depending. I've also included the high poly wireframe for interest sake.

<br /><br />...
<br /><br />I've setup a very quick bone structure and very quick skin just for a little pose test. Deformation is obviously not that great but does the job for this test.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img110.imageshack.us/my.php?image=qdemon102cb.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img110.imageshack.us/img110/7868/qdemon102cb.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />I think the posture should be fine for the final model based on this test. I did model it originally off an import from the model from Quake so the shape should be very similar and so I should be able to get the right body posture and so on.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p102424" date="Posted: Mon Jul 04, 2005 4:31 pm "><author>MBolus</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Looking good so far.

It really can get low enough when you pose it. I like it. The lack of neck is part of the demon's charm.
<br /><br />You're far enough into the modeling process that I can't think of anything constructive to say that won't require major reworking. I'm curious, how heavily to you rely on sketches when you model? What's your workflow like?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p102449" date="Posted: Mon Jul 04, 2005 6:23 pm "><author>obihb</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold">MBolus</span>: I've moved the shoulder down on purpose for this pose. Unless you mean something else. I made it look like he hangs the shoulder sortof. I didn't really use reference much so stuff could be wrong. The only type of ref I used was a basic form of the creature's shape and some muscle ref for some stuff.
<br /><br />I'll give the horms a tweak and see what it looks like. Don't know about the claws, maybe I'll check that aswell.
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Sparky</span>: For this model I used no sketches. In general I don't use them. First time I ever did my own sketch for a model was for the Shambler. Usually I would just do it from my head or look at pictures if I wanna get something spesific right.
<br /><br />I had some muscle reference for the arms, a bit for the back and chest. The rest I sucked from my thumb.. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> To get the shape right overall I had a model I imported a long time ago from Quake to base it from. The gray mesh you see in the first shots is from a very simple model from that imported one.
<br /><br />If you had anything to say even if it needs reworking it would still be good to hear. Of course I might not actually do it but if it's worth the effort then, why not?.. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p102464" date="Posted: Mon Jul 04, 2005 8:13 pm "><author>Taffmaster</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">thats one ugly looking demon, it belongs in a zoo. any plans for releasing this deformed freak?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p102498" date="Posted: Tue Jul 05, 2005 3:31 am "><author>whatthe</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">thats one cool looking demon, excellent work, keep it up</div>]]></body></post><post id="p102592" date="Posted: Tue Jul 05, 2005 1:31 pm "><author>obihb</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold">Taffmaster</span>: Yes, I hope to release it as a new monster for Doom.

<br /><br /><br />Playing around with the vertex painter. It's the first time I really used it for this type of thing. It's pretty cool and can do layers and blend them with the same type of blend modes as in Photoshop can.
<br /><br />I did this to see what a bit of color would look like. Just having some fun. My idea in the end is to make the high poly model look as good as I can then render to texture for the low poly so I spend very little time on texturing the low poly. A great feature in Max to have.. render to texture.. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img32.imageshack.us/my.php?image=qdemon129xu.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img32.imageshack.us/img32/3189/qdemon129xu.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img32.imageshack.us/my.php?image=qdemon139fv.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img32.imageshack.us/img32/2056/qdemon139fv.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a></div>]]></body></post><post id="p102594" date="Posted: Tue Jul 05, 2005 1:53 pm "><author>CSR 1963</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Dude, awesome.

<br /><br /><br />Started to unwrap this sucker. This isn't a huge update, just more to show what I'm working towards. This has some texture on the body and I'm using my original vertex colors to do the shading for me. Works pretty well. This is the basic idea I have for the look of it. Obviously still lots to do texture wise but it's getting somewhere I think.

That does not get translated into the normal map because it only renders the mesh normals for that. &#13;
<br/><br/>
There are some seams in the normal map for sure but which I can't do anything about because it is the nature of the technology to have some seams unless you can manage a seamless UV map which is impossible. The seams aren't too "heavy" though but you'll see them if you get to look at the model in realtime and from different angles.&#13;

I've been dealing with alot of the technical bull that come with making a new monster and I think I've solved most of it now. I've also finally started some animation which is always more fun. Here's a walking cycle I've been working on. I'm mostly happy with it but there's always place for more tweaks when it comes to animation.&#13;

I like how the monster really does look quite organic and natural in the area between the leg and body, and then the tail has a very spooky bounce to it in the middle. But it does seem like it's straying a little from the original Quake monster, but I guess that's a good thing considering how primitive the animations were for that. &#13;
<br/>
Keep up the great work!&#13;
<br/><br/>
EDIT: Also, don't forget that the tail is there to counter-balance the top of his torso and his blade-arms. So if his tail tilts then his whole upper body should arcordingly.

There are some seams in the normal map for sure but which I can't do anything about because it is the nature of the technology to have some seams unless you can manage a seamless UV map which is impossible. The seams aren't too "heavy" though but you'll see them if you get to look at the model in realtime and from different angles.&#13;

I've been dealing with alot of the technical bull that come with making a new monster and I think I've solved most of it now. I've also finally started some animation which is always more fun. Here's a walking cycle I've been working on. I'm mostly happy with it but there's always place for more tweaks when it comes to animation.&#13;
