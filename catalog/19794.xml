<br /><br />I've spent weeks work working on my first ever mudbox model, it came out ok for my first model and I made a game mesh for it and baked the normal map out in maya which came out with no errors; in maya it looks great.
<br /><br />Before animating it and getting him running about I thought I'd make a dirty placeholder diffuse map and stick him in a level as a static ASE model and to my horror it was terrible.
<br /><br />Does anyone have any tips in this subject as it will help alot, I dont really want to continue now till its right.

<br /><br />I know the model aint great to begin with but I was really hoping it would be alot better than this mess so any help would really be awesome as I've hit a brick wall.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p180889" date="Posted: Wed Jun 13, 2007 10:55 pm "><author>Kristus</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Render the normalmap with renderbump instead.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p180890" date="Posted: Wed Jun 13, 2007 11:10 pm "><author>birritan</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">renderbump doesnt seemt o be wanting to do anything
