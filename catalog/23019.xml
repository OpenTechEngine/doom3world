Now i wanted to replay some old games (namely Prey and Quake4) and i face constant game freezes unter XP on BOTH games.  Both games worked fine on my old card.<br /><br />Both games run very smoothly in high details and 1280x1024 with 2xAA and i can play for a while but then suddenly the screen freezes. The sound continues to play in the background.<br />I can switch to task manager and kill the game process and anything is fine again. I can restart the game and play a while but then the same thing happens. No error message at all, just a total freeze of the screen. Other games like Hl2 are working fine.<br /><br />XP Pro is up-to date as is directx and graphics drivers (catalyst 9.7). Neither the processor (AMD Athlon64 3700+) nor the graphics card is overclocked. I say that because i´ve read on my excessive google search that the doom3 Engine does not like overclocking. BUT the HD4650 is known to work like this: the core clock frequency is lowered massively in 2d made to save energy and is boosted to 600 MHz in 3D mode ... could it be that this is the reason for this freeze?<br /><br />Any help would be greatly appreciated!<br />Kusie</div>]]></body></post><post id="p217235" date="Posted: Fri Aug 14, 2009 12:38 pm "><author>The Happy Friar</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">did you completely uninstall the nvidia drivers?
