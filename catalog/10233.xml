But if u got permission from a guy higher up from him then release if not then just go about your business im sure other guys in this community can make a model just as good or better and release it in a map or just release it.<br/>_________________<br/>Picked up a double barrel shotgun</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

So your saying the Delphi I was mapping, for a mod that no longer exists, shouldn't be released to the public? Or is that just another way of asking for people to not release work of your's with out permission? (which is fine, btw).&#13;

Good point&#13;

<br/><br/>
Especially since we're talking about content that is game ready. It just seems like a waste of time considering that a lot of effort was put into making assets work with Doom 3 specifically, only for these assets never to see the light of day.&#13;
<br/><br/>
I can understand people wanting credit for their work and how often times when people do give away assets they don't recieve any credit.&#13;
<br/><br/>
But seriously, we're all making things here and nobody is getting paid for it.&#13;
<br/><br/>
If people are talented enough to produce assets that are top notch like this model here then certainly they won't have any trouble jumping on board another mod team and getting their work out their and noticed.&#13;
<br/><br/>
That's what you all want credit for anyways right?</td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody">&#13;

Of course, no matter what, it's the author's decision, so I'll shut up now.  <img src="/web/20061013054238im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0"/></span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

But if u got permission from a guy higher up from him then release if not then just go about your business im sure other guys in this community can make a model just as good or better and release it in a map or just release it.<br/>_________________<br/>Picked up a double barrel shotgun</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>
