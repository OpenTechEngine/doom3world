<br /><br />Don't post "my new map" or I'll kill you, literally speaking.
<br /><br />Give it a name like yournick_dm_1 or whatever and use that as headline, please!
<br /><br />As the first two letters in the headline please add "SP" for single player or "MP" for multi player.
<br /><br />Posting screenshots is very fine, yet please don't throw in 20 screens at 1600*1200 - limit yourself to 3 or 4 good shots or the special cases you want to show off. The maximum image size width shouldn't be over 640 pixels - if you have higher resolution images, please post text links to them.
<br /><br />If not I'll edit them out completely - not everyone has broadband, let alone the fact that the page will become unreadable...
<br /><br />If you have gathered enough feedback in the Maps WIP froum and tweaked your map to the max, then release it here under the SAME headline as in the Maps WIP forum.
<br /><br />When done so add the link to the WIP version to your release thread  - so you increase chances that your map will get more playtime by people who only follow one of the forums.
<br /><br />The web was meant to find and share information faster and easier - not to confuse people and steal their time by searching around.

<br /><br />This i have to disagree on, to some degree.  I mean, i agree that, specifically for multiplayer, you need playtesting for a map to come together, but that doesn't mean that a multi- or single player maps needs to be tested publically.  If the person does there testing internally or from another site then why should the post it as a wip here as well?  
<br /><br />As for your other concerns (ie the steamy piles of 1's and 0's that some people call maps) its going to happen anywhere that people publically release maps.  Some of it is that the authors are new/young and really don't know.  Some people are just wankers.  For those people who don't know any better the only way to learn that is to put their 'final' map out and have people tell them how bad it is.  They'll either take it to heart and try to make a better (ie real) map or just stop mapping from frustration (and given how much effort making a good map is this isn't necessarily always a bad thing - making maps isn't for everyone)
<br /><br />I've talked to BNA! though about getting a review section up (and he was pretty positive about it) over the 'final maps' so that should be one way to augment beforehand if a map is even worth it.  Another is to check the feedback.  a third is to look at the screenshots.  Also though, worse comes to worse, you do a 2 min download, 1 min of 'wow this is bad' and them 'whooomph', into the recycle bin.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p47995" date="Posted: Tue Sep 07, 2004 9:39 pm "><author>Hemebond</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Personally, I prefer the filename format<div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">&lt;game mode&gt;_&lt;map name&gt;_&lt;version&gt;.ext</div></div>]]></body></post><post id="p30686" date="Posted: Sun Aug 08, 2004 3:54 pm "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">This forum is meant to show off and release the final version of the map you've been working on.
