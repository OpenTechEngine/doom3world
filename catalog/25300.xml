Can see glances of my maps. Where you have your Z, XY, and Camera, theyre not showing, well some. For example the window for Z, this is showing what the Camera should be showing, XY is showing what Z would be showing and then camera window is showing Z's "output/feed" have not played around with the editor for at least a year. Im not sure if it has to do with me having the game on three of my hard drives (back up's, but plugged in). This is definetly a new kind of problem, i doubt that any one has had the same problem. If any of you smarter people have any clues, it would be appreciated. I hope it will be something "challenging". There are 2 pictures attached. Thank you for taking your time to help.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p237314" date="Posted: Sat Feb 04, 2012 11:38 am "><author>slush_puppy</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I had a similiar problem on 3 different occations.
