[example: 5]<br /><br />-In an Edit poly modifier, select a polygon sublevel, then go to polygon properties, check the "clear selection" box, and enter a number near "Select ID" (start with last X submaterial +1)[example: 6]<br /><br />-If you got some polygons selected, that's a part of the problem, cause as you noticed, there are only 5 submaterials...<br />so apply the right material by entering another submaterial with the "Set ID" polygon properties.<br />(that's how you should apply your submaterials rather than detach elements, apply material, re-attach, etc...)<br /><br />Repeat the last operation with higher submaterials' ID to erase all the wrong references.<br /><br />EDIT: obihb beat me!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121041524im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p203277" date="Posted: Thu Aug 07, 2008 11:37 am "><author>Shadowflamez</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Yeah...

[example: 5]<br /><br />-In an Edit poly modifier, select a polygon sublevel, then go to polygon properties, check the "clear selection" box, and enter a number near "Select ID" (start with last X submaterial +1)[example: 6]<br /><br />-If you got some polygons selected, that's a part of the problem, cause as you noticed, there are only 5 submaterials...<br />so apply the right material by entering another submaterial with the "Set ID" polygon properties.<br />(that's how you should apply your submaterials rather than detach elements, apply material, re-attach, etc...)<br /><br />Repeat the last operation with higher submaterials' ID to erase all the wrong references.<br /><br />EDIT: obihb beat me!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121040624im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p203277" date="Posted: Thu Aug 07, 2008 11:37 am "><author>Shadowflamez</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Yeah...
