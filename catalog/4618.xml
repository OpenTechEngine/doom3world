I haven't had too much time to test it but I tried to import some Doom III models (imp and fatty) into MAX and then re-export them with my exporter and the results seem to be correct. BTW, I have only tested the exporter in MAX6.&#13;
<br/><br/>
The worst of this exporter is that takes up too much time for meshes with a medium/high poly count. That's because, to avoid duplicated vertices, I have to, for each face index, loop through the final list of vertices and compare vertex &amp; texture coordinates for each vertex in the list.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Another thing that bugs me is that, when I animate a bone using a LookAt controller (the bone is linked to a node who indicates the bone the direction to look at), the exporter doesn't detect the transform for that bone so no animated components for this bone are exported.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Anyway, hope you find it useful. There is a help file (in spanish and "english" <img src="/web/20061013061259im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0"/>) into the zip file explaining all about the exporter.&#13;
<br/><br/>
I want to thank bozo for the MD5 specs and der_ton for his MD5 viewer. That way I were able to test my exporter fast and easily. <img src="/web/20061013061259im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0"/><br/><br/><a href="/web/20061013061259/http://www.arrakis.es/~jonathan01/d3w/MD5Exporter.zip" target="_blank" class="postlink"><span style="font-weight: bold">Download MD5Export for MAX</span></a> (outdated)&#13;

I have to admit that I took a look at your exporter when I came to a point the bone orientations were not correctly. I found the solution in the:&#13;
<br/><br/>
if (q.w &lt; 0) do ....switch the sign of the quat components&#13;
<br/><br/>
and that was  before I read the post of bozo where he exposed this solution so I guess I should credit you. And well, if you see something more, similar to your code let me know, please. Besides that, I don't remember more things.&#13;
<br/><br/>
I have credited people in the help file, you included but only for the md5 viewer so I will credit you for your exporter. I'm not here to make enemies. <img src="/web/20061013061259im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0"/><br/><br/>
Said that. I want to comment something about your code. You have a function that converts a left handed matrix to a right handed one. I thought that MAX stored rotations in a right handed way. So is that for something special or to assure that the matrices are correct?. I say that because I don't convert the matrices to right handed and all seems to work. But who know, always exists a case that destroys all your theories. <img src="/web/20061013061259im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0"/><br/><br/>
One thing more. Your exporter takes less time to export the geometry than mine. As I said before, that's because, to avoid duplicated vertices, I have to, for each face index, loop through the final list of vertices and compare vertex and texture coordinates for each vertex in the list. Do you do something like that or do you export duplicated vertices?.&#13;
<br/><br/>
That's all for now. And sorry for any inconvenience.&#13;
<br/><br/>

i think, when you create bones via mirror them, than this mirrored bones have this left-handed matrixes and the code fix this&#13;

The truth is that I haven't rigged a mesh in my life so things like mirroring bones escapes from my understanding. <img src="/web/20061013061259im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0"/><br/><br/>

The thing with the mirrored bones matrices resulting in lefthanded bones came up with a model that 7318 did once. If you scale a bone negatively, then the transform matrix becomes lefthanded. &#13;
<br/>
That is also related to the fact that the "transform" property is not necessarily the same as the combined "pos * quat as matrix". That is also mentioned in the maxscript documentation:&#13;

<br/><br/>
About the duplicate vertices, I don't check for that, nope. But I'm not sure if that's necessary. Maybe that's related to another difference in our exporters. Yours collapses each mesh to use one material (even if it uses submaterials), while mine splits it into md5 submeshes according to the used submaterials. I think your way of creating submeshes is to export multiple mesh objects from 3dmax.&#13;
<br/><br/>
BTW, I encountered a real problem with exporting via maxscript, it affects both our exporters. The 6 digit precision of float output is not enough, my camera importer/exporter is done but the problem is really evident there, because the quaternions need better precision. &#13;
<br/>
The problem can also be seen when you export a mesh (with your or my exporter) and import it with my importer again, then there are some slight deviations. I'll think about a custom print function for floats. I don't know of a way to tell Maxscript to use better precision for the built-in print float.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="/web/20061013061259/http://www.doom3world.org/" target="_blank" class="postlink"><img src="/web/20061013061259im_/http://www.doom3world.org/site/img/d3w.gif" border="0"/> Staff</a>&#13;

Thanks for the explanation. I have implemented your right handed funcion and now, when using mirrored bones, the orientation is ok but the faces affected by these bones are reversed!. I'll have to take a look on it.&#13;

Exactly. With my exporter, only one material can be assigned to one mesh so if you want to export multiple meshes with different materials assigned, also, you have to have multiple meshes in MAX.&#13;

So now I have some stuff in mind. I'm thinking of supports biped bones and give the option to export "physiqued" meshes. My first attempt to write a MD5 exporter (when the leaked alpha came up) was using physique to export skinned meshes so if I have time enough, I could try this.&#13;

Seems to be clear that first triplet is the camera position, the second is the camera orientation and finally the camera fov (correct me if I'm wrong, please).&#13;
<br/><br/>
But now the cuts stuff. I think is a way to specify different "camera takes" so, in the example above, one take would be from 0 to 98, another from 99 to 148, and so on. Is this correct?.&#13;

My importer imports in the same format, so that's gonna be left in forever.

Not a bad idea at all. Anyway we are sharing code so that's a form of collaboration and a way to speed up the development. And of course, I think we, coders, are a bit reticent to work in group. Each one has his/her code style, his/her obsessions, etc. <img src="/web/20061013061259im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0"/><br/><br/>
And comming back to the exporter, I have found a "bug" in MAX. Actually I don't know if it's a bug or a windows limitation. When you call the function getSaveFileName with a long extension (more than 8 chars), MAX throws an unhandled exception. You can try that executing this in "MAXScript Listener":&#13;
<br/><br/></span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" border="0" align="center"><tr><td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td>	</tr><tr><td class="code">getSaveFileName caption:"Save MD5Camera" types:"Doom III MD5Camera (*.md5camera)|*.md5camera"</td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody">&#13;
<br/><br/>
A save dialog will be shown where you have to specify the file location and name. So if you don't add the ".md5camera" extension manually to the name of the file, the exception will be thrown.&#13;
<br/><br/>
I have seen that der_ton add automatically a file name and the extension but does exist another way around this?&#13;
<br/><br/>
When I solve this problem I'll release the new version with md5camera support.&#13;

I haven't had too much time to test it but I tried to import some Doom III models (imp and fatty) into MAX and then re-export them with my exporter and the results seem to be correct. BTW, I have only tested the exporter in MAX6.&#13;
<br/><br/>
The worst of this exporter is that takes up too much time for meshes with a medium/high poly count. That's because, to avoid duplicated vertices, I have to, for each face index, loop through the final list of vertices and compare vertex &amp; texture coordinates for each vertex in the list.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Another thing that bugs me is that, when I animate a bone using a LookAt controller (the bone is linked to a node who indicates the bone the direction to look at), the exporter doesn't detect the transform for that bone so no animated components for this bone are exported.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Anyway, hope you find it useful. There is a help file (in spanish and "english" <img src="/web/20061013054704im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0"/>) into the zip file explaining all about the exporter.&#13;

I have to admit that I took a look at your exporter when I came to a point the bone orientations were not correctly. I found the solution in the:&#13;
<br/><br/>
if (q.w &lt; 0) do ....switch the sign of the quat components&#13;
<br/><br/>
and that was  before I read the post of bozo where he exposed this solution so I guess I should credit you. And well, if you see something more, similar to your code let me know, please. Besides that, I don't remember more things.&#13;
<br/><br/>
I have credited people in the help file, you included but only for the md5 viewer so I will credit you for your exporter. I'm not here to make enemies. <img src="/web/20061013054704im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0"/><br/><br/>
Said that. I want to comment something about your code. You have a function that converts a left handed matrix to a right handed one. I thought that MAX stored rotations in a right handed way. So is that for something special or to assure that the matrices are correct?. I say that because I don't convert the matrices to right handed and all seems to work. But who know, always exists a case that destroys all your theories. <img src="/web/20061013054704im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0"/><br/><br/>
One thing more. Your exporter takes less time to export the geometry than mine. As I said before, that's because, to avoid duplicated vertices, I have to, for each face index, loop through the final list of vertices and compare vertex and texture coordinates for each vertex in the list. Do you do something like that or do you export duplicated vertices?.&#13;
<br/><br/>
That's all for now. And sorry for any inconvenience.&#13;

The thing with the mirrored bones matrices resulting in lefthanded bones came up with a model that 7318 did once. If you scale a bone negatively, then the transform matrix becomes lefthanded. &#13;
<br/>
That is also related to the fact that the "transform" property is not necessarily the same as the combined "pos * quat as matrix". That is also mentioned in the maxscript documentation:&#13;
<br/></span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" border="0" align="center"><tr><td><span class="genmed"><b>Quote:</b></span></td>	</tr><tr><td class="quote">Take care when mixing rotation derived from these matrices and rotation used in rotation-related functions or from rotation properties.</td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody">&#13;
<br/><br/>
About the duplicate vertices, I don't check for that, nope. But I'm not sure if that's necessary. Maybe that's related to another difference in our exporters. Yours collapses each mesh to use one material (even if it uses submaterials), while mine splits it into md5 submeshes according to the used submaterials. I think your way of creating submeshes is to export multiple mesh objects from 3dmax.&#13;
<br/><br/>
BTW, I encountered a real problem with exporting via maxscript, it affects both our exporters. The 6 digit precision of float output is not enough, my camera importer/exporter is done but the problem is really evident there, because the quaternions need better precision. &#13;
<br/>
The problem can also be seen when you export a mesh (with your or my exporter) and import it with my importer again, then there are some slight deviations. I'll think about a custom print function for floats. I don't know of a way to tell Maxscript to use better precision for the built-in print float.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="/web/20061013054704/http://www.doom3world.org/" target="_blank" class="postlink"><img src="/web/20061013054704im_/http://www.doom3world.org/site/img/d3w.gif" border="0"/> Staff</a>&#13;

Exactly. With my exporter, only one material can be assigned to one mesh so if you want to export multiple meshes with different materials assigned, also, you have to have multiple meshes in MAX.&#13;

Of course, I have to add support for md5camera too! <img src="/web/20061013054704im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0"/><br/><br/>

Seems to be clear that first triplet is the camera position, the second is the camera orientation and finally the camera fov (correct me if I'm wrong, please).&#13;
<br/><br/>
But now the cuts stuff. I think is a way to specify different "camera takes" so, in the example above, one take would be from 0 to 98, another from 99 to 148, and so on. Is this correct?.&#13;

My importer imports in the same format, so that's gonna be left in forever.

Not a bad idea at all. Anyway we are sharing code so that's a form of collaboration and a way to speed up the development. And of course, I think we, coders, are a bit reticent to work in group. Each one has his/her code style, his/her obsessions, etc. <img src="/web/20061013054704im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0"/><br/><br/>
And comming back to the exporter, I have found a "bug" in MAX. Actually I don't know if it's a bug or a windows limitation. When you call the function getSaveFileName with a long extension (more than 8 chars), MAX throws an unhandled exception. You can try that executing this in "MAXScript Listener":&#13;
<br/><br/></span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" border="0" align="center"><tr><td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td>	</tr><tr><td class="code">getSaveFileName caption:"Save MD5Camera" types:"Doom III MD5Camera (*.md5camera)|*.md5camera"</td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody">&#13;
<br/><br/>
A save dialog will be shown where you have to specify the file location and name. So if you don't add the ".md5camera" extension manually to the name of the file, the exception will be thrown.&#13;
<br/><br/>
I have seen that der_ton add automatically a file name and the extension but does exist another way around this?&#13;
<br/><br/>
When I solve this problem I'll release the new version with md5camera support.&#13;

Hi Guyz,&#13;
<br/><br/>
I'm really a newbie about Modelling 4 Games and i use the gmax-MD5-Exporter today the first time.&#13;
<br/><br/>
I've the same Error, but now I know how to solve ;o)&#13;
<br/><br/>
You MUST have a UVW-Map (or another Mapping-Info and Material I think) join to your Mesh. Then the gmax-Exporter works fine!&#13;

I'm so sorry for not answer your questions before.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Well, the MD5 exporter for Character Studio seems to have some problems with some types of weights, so (sometimes) the mesh deforms incorrectly. That's  the reason I have not release this exporter yet.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Yesterday I was doing some changes in the exporter (the skin modifier version) because one of the artists uses CAT as animation system and the previous version of my exporter only supported MAX bones. So the new version supports (in theory) any node you use as a bone with the skin modifier (standard MAX bones, CAT, biped I guess, etc).&#13;
<br/><br/>
You can download the new version for the skin modifier <a href="/web/20061013061107/http://www.arrakis.es/~jonathan01/d3w/MD5.MAX.Exporter.For.Skin.Modifier.zip" target="_blank" class="postlink">here</a>. Hope it works... <img src="/web/20061013061107im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0"/><br/><br/>
Here's a list of (important) things to do:&#13;
<br/><ul><br/><li>Reduce the amount of time needed to export the mesh.&#13;
<br/></li><li>A progress bar.&#13;
<br/></li></ul><br/>

As I stated before, this exporter has some problems with the weights and I don't know if I'll give it a chance so...&#13;
<br/><br/>
Fortunately, there's another option for the people that still want to make use of Character Studio and be able to export to MD5. You can download an utility plugin from <span style="font-weight: bold"><a href="/web/20061013061107/http://sparks.discreet.com/" target="_blank" class="postlink">sparks.discreet.com</a></span> named <span style="font-weight: bold">phy2skin</span> that converts a "physiqued" mesh to a skinned mesh. I have uploaded this plugin to my ftp so you don't need to register in sparks. You can download it <span style="font-weight: bold"><a href="/web/20061013061107/http://www.arrakis.es/~jonathan01/d3w/phy2skin.zip" target="_blank" class="postlink">here</a></span>.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Once you convert the physique mesh to skin, you can export your model with one of the MD5 exporters available for the skin modifier.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Hope you'll find this interesting.<br/>_________________<br/>Excuse my bad english. <img src="/web/20061013061107im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0"/></span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

I'm not sure why, maybe it's not geometry based. (Like I said, I know little about this stuff. - The mesh is an imported one, deleted the weapon, and replaced with one that I have successfully gotten into the game before It is triangle based if thats what geometry based means?) &#13;
<br/><br/>
When I press the "add" button it does nothing, Also, I've tried both selecting and deselecting the nodes, and no matter what is there the add button does nothing. (Whether it is selected or not the add button does nothing - there is no list to select from if I hit H there is though...) Also, the other add button does work, though you have to click in the corners.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Also all the other buttons work ok... &#13;
<br/><br/>
It's probably my setup or something. Thx anyway...&#13;
<br/><br/>
Anyway, it was just a 5 min test object thats not even textured or anything to see If I could get it to replace an existing weapon... &#13;
<br/><br/>
If you import a md5mesh, and animation, is there something that would need to be done, to get it to export correctly?<br/>_________________<br/>RedWolf&#13;

Are there any situations where the ADD button won't even work. (It looks like it becomes orange-ish, it doesn't do that or anything)&#13;
<br/><br/>
Like I said the other buttons work, though I have to click in the botom left corner of the camera add button....&#13;
<br/><br/>
Trying to narrow down the prob, if you have a new file open, with nothing is the "add" button clickable? If it is, then It's not my mesh(s) and it's some other problem a setting or who knows... If the add botton isn't supposed to do anything unless there is a valid mesh, then I need to figure out why it isn't valid....&#13;

I don't really know what is the problem with the model. The only modifier on the stack is the Skin modifier, I've added enough submaterials (this was the first problem, but I've overcame it).&#13;
<br/><br/>
I'm using 3dsmax 8 SP3 on WinXP x64. &#13;
<br/>
The model I've tried to export can be downloaded here:&#13;
<br/><a href="/web/20061013054722/http://holoiroda.com/2Forum_Dino.zip" target="_blank">http://holoiroda.com/2Forum_Dino.zip</a>&#13;
<br/><br/>
BTW, where can I find a list of the features that are supported / unsupported by the exporter? The readme does not contain much information about this, some bits of information can be found in this forum, but I was unable to find a comprehensive list of the things I'm allowed or not allowed to do if I ever want to export my model to MD5.&#13;
<br/><br/>
I would be very grateful if someone could help me with these issues.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Best regards,&#13;

yes, it has lost of bones which animate it. Unfortunately, I cannot load the model to an older max..&#13;

Maybe I should move to the thread of der_ton's MD5 exporter, because with that, at least 'something' gets exported (after some modifications), but it's still far from correct. Only the eyes of the dino are exported, strange, huh?&#13;

Is the whole model one single object? My exporter only exports one object (the selected one). You'll have to merge the meshes into a single one.

I'm really a newbie about Modelling 4 Games and i use the gmax-MD5-Exporter today the first time.&#13;

I've the same Error, but now I know how to solve ;o)&#13;

You MUST have a UVW-Map (or another Mapping-Info and Material I think) join to your Mesh. Then the gmax-Exporter works fine!&#13;

I haven't had too much time to test it but I tried to import some Doom III models (imp and fatty) into MAX and then re-export them with my exporter and the results seem to be correct. BTW, I have only tested the exporter in MAX6.
<br /><br />The worst of this exporter is that takes up too much time for meshes with a medium/high poly count. That's because, to avoid duplicated vertices, I have to, for each face index, loop through the final list of vertices and compare vertex &amp; texture coordinates for each vertex in the list.
<br /><br />Another thing that bugs me is that, when I animate a bone using a LookAt controller (the bone is linked to a node who indicates the bone the direction to look at), the exporter doesn't detect the transform for that bone so no animated components for this bone are exported.
<br /><br />Anyway, hope you find it useful. There is a help file (in spanish and "english" <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081119193823im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />) into the zip file explaining all about the exporter.

<br />I have to admit that I took a look at your exporter when I came to a point the bone orientations were not correctly. I found the solution in the:
<br /><br />if (q.w &lt; 0) do ....switch the sign of the quat components
<br /><br />and that was  before I read the post of bozo where he exposed this solution so I guess I should credit you. And well, if you see something more, similar to your code let me know, please. Besides that, I don't remember more things.
<br /><br />I have credited people in the help file, you included but only for the md5 viewer so I will credit you for your exporter.

I want to comment something about your code. You have a function that converts a left handed matrix to a right handed one. I thought that MAX stored rotations in a right handed way. So is that for something special or to assure that the matrices are correct?. I say that because I don't convert the matrices to right handed and all seems to work. But who know, always exists a case that destroys all your theories. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081119193823im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /><br /><br />One thing more. Your exporter takes less time to export the geometry than mine. As I said before, that's because, to avoid duplicated vertices, I have to, for each face index, loop through the final list of vertices and compare vertex and texture coordinates for each vertex in the list. Do you do something like that or do you export duplicated vertices?.
<br /><br />That's all for now. And sorry for any inconvenience.

If you scale a bone negatively, then the transform matrix becomes lefthanded. 
<br />That is also related to the fact that the "transform" property is not necessarily the same as the combined "pos * quat as matrix". That is also mentioned in the maxscript documentation:
<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Take care when mixing rotation derived from these matrices and rotation used in rotation-related functions or from rotation properties.</div>
<br /><br />About the duplicate vertices, I don't check for that, nope. But I'm not sure if that's necessary. Maybe that's related to another difference in our exporters. Yours collapses each mesh to use one material (even if it uses submaterials), while mine splits it into md5 submeshes according to the used submaterials. I think your way of creating submeshes is to export multiple mesh objects from 3dmax.
<br /><br />BTW, I encountered a real problem with exporting via maxscript, it affects both our exporters. The 6 digit precision of float output is not enough, my camera importer/exporter is done but the problem is really evident there, because the quaternions need better precision. 
<br />The problem can also be seen when you export a mesh (with your or my exporter) and import it with my importer again, then there are some slight deviations. I'll think about a custom print function for floats. I don't know of a way to tell Maxscript to use better precision for the built-in print float.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p40558" date="Posted: Mon Aug 23, 2004 3:54 pm "><author>BeRSeRKeR</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">der_ton wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Berserker, I'm totally ok with all of that. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081119193823im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div><br />Nice. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081119193823im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">der_ton wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">The thing with the mirrored bones matrices resulting in lefthanded bones came up with a model that 7318 did once.

<br /><br />So now I have some stuff in mind. I'm thinking of supports biped bones and give the option to export "physiqued" meshes. My first attempt to write a MD5 exporter (when the leaked alpha came up) was using physique to export skinned meshes so if I have time enough, I could try this.
<br /><br />Of course, I have to add support for md5camera too! <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081119193823im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Greets.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p40648" date="Posted: Mon Aug 23, 2004 7:30 pm "><author>BeRSeRKeR</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I have a question regarding md5camera file format.
<br /><br />Here is a snip of data:
<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">cuts {<br />   96<br />   148<br />   198<br />   290<br />   324<br />}<br /><br />camera {<br />   ( 1781.0610351563 293.2318115234 70.8310394287 ) ( 0.09791141 -0.0939290896 -0.714956522 ) 72.1649246216<br />   ....<br />}</div>
<br /><br />Seems to be clear that first triplet is the camera position, the second is the camera orientation and finally the camera fov (correct me if I'm wrong, please).
<br /><br />But now the cuts stuff. I think is a way to specify different "camera takes" so, in the example above, one take would be from 0 to 98, another from 99 to 148, and so on. Is this correct?.

<br />Not a bad idea at all. Anyway we are sharing code so that's a form of collaboration and a way to speed up the development. And of course, I think we, coders, are a bit reticent to work in group. Each one has his/her code style, his/her obsessions, etc. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081119193823im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />And comming back to the exporter, I have found a "bug" in MAX. Actually I don't know if it's a bug or a windows limitation. When you call the function getSaveFileName with a long extension (more than 8 chars), MAX throws an unhandled exception. You can try that executing this in "MAXScript Listener":
<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">getSaveFileName caption:"Save MD5Camera" types:"Doom III MD5Camera (*.md5camera)|*.md5camera"</div>
<br /><br />A save dialog will be shown where you have to specify the file location and name. So if you don't add the ".md5camera" extension manually to the name of the file, the exception will be thrown.
<br /><br />I have seen that der_ton add automatically a file name and the extension but does exist another way around this?
<br /><br />When I solve this problem I'll release the new version with md5camera support.
