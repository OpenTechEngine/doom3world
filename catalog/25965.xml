If we want to show id Software our disappointment with DOOM 3 BFG Edition... then we WILL create OUR OWN BFG EDITION for id Software. Which means that we will make DOOM 3 be more like DOOM 3 Alpha. NO PDA'S, NO AUDIO LOGS, NO TEXT LOGS, Storage Lockers open, DOOM 1 Looking Shotgun. More realistic weapon sounds and look. No more shrieking from the Imps! No flashlight, more action, tons of blood and gore (but not to the point where the PC lags)<br /><br />And once we make DOOM 3 like that.<br /><br />We make Ressurection of Evil like that.<br /><br />We make The Lost Mission like that.<br /><br /><br />And <span style="color: #FF0000">DOOM 1 and 2</span> This is where everyone... comes together to make one huge mod.... a remake of DOOM 1 and 2. But if it had today's technology capabilities. High-poly 3D models, high-quality remakes of the textures, remaking the levels, making all the weapons sound and feel badass, remake the music with real guitars heck if you want maybe we could even put in the actual song that inspired the level into it.<br /><br /><br />Like<br /><br />E1M1: Painkiller- Judas Priest<br /><br />E1M2: The Thing That Should Not Be - Metallica<br /><br />E1M3: Criminally Insane- SLAYER<br /><br />E1M4: Rise- Pantera<br /><br />E1M5:<br /><br />E1M6: Sanity Obscure-Believer<br /><br />E1M7:<br /><br />E1M8:<br /><br />E1M9:<br /><br />Intermission Music: We Die Young- Alice in Chains<br /><br />E2M1: Big Gun- AC/DC<br /><br />E2M2: The Call of Cthulu- Metallica<br /><br />E2M3: We Die Young- Alice in Chains<br /><br />E2M4:<br /><br />E2M5:<br /><br />E2M6:<br /><br />E2M7:<br /><br />E2M8:<br /><br />E2M9: Mouth for War- Pantera<br /><br />E3M1: Mouth for War-Pantera<br /><br />E3M2: Leather Rebel-Judas Priest<br /><br />E3M3: Behind the Crooked Cross-SLAYER<br /><br />E3M4:<br /><br />E3M5:<br /><br />E3M6:<br /><br />E3M7:<br /><br />E3M8: Silent Scream-SLAYER<br /><br />E3M9:<br /><br />E4M1:<br /><br />E4M2:<br /><br />E4M3: Behind the Crooked Cross-SLAYER<br /><br />E4M4:<br /><br />E4M5:<br /><br />E4M6:<br /><br />E4M7:<br /><br />E4M8: Silent Scream-SLAYER<br /><br />E4M9:<br /><br /><br /><br />I'm thinking for the weapons that they should be center screen like the Classic DOOM 1 and 2.....<br /><br />And they should sound badass and look like true 3D remakes of the sprites....<br /><br /><br />High poly models too.<br /><br />We'll show Risen3D and DOOMSDAY and id Software what a DOOM 1 and 2 Remake truly is!<br /><br /><br />Also give the Nazi SS Soldiers on MAP31: Wolfenstein and MAP32: Grosse<br /><br />Give them MP40's and Luger's, have tons of swastikas, don't censor shit, heck if German users complain who gives a damn? Austria for the win! <br /><br />Also make it so the player can pick up MP40's and Lugers.<br /><br />And I have an awesome idea for the Zombiemen!<br /><br />Give them Semi-Auto FAMAS (like the original) except you can pick it up and use it too.<br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319224128im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />Honestly, what do you guys think?

It should be very atmospheric and emulate the feel of the Classic Resident Evil games.<br /><br /><br />DOOM 1 and 2 remade on the DOOM 3 engine... it should take advantage of the modern technology, such as non-center screen weapons. Reloading is a must, however it must be short quick reload animations nothing fancy, we don't need COD styled "LOOK AT ME TAKING FOREVER HURH HURH!" Goldeneye Reloading is an option. You could do Goldeneye N64 Reload Animations or Simple Quick Animations.<br /><br />Iron Sights we need, not only to appeal to this generation... but to also make the game feel realistic.<br /><br /><br />Bunnyhopping, rocketjumping, strafejumping, and running 100 MPHS... that's a must!<br /><br />We need tons of blood and gore but not to the point were the PC lags...<br /><br /><br />We need much more ragdoll physics implemented.<br /><br />Destructible enviroments.<br /><br />Make the monsters look 10000X scarier. It's 2012... we can make high-poly models of the sprites right guys?<br /><br />Also, we can take a vote... I believe in a democratic system..<br /><br /><br />All in favor of center screen weapons for DOOM 1 and 2 Remake say: DOOM IS FUCKING AWESOME!<br /><br />All those NOT in favor of center screen weapons for DOOM 1 and 2 Remake say: DOOM 3 IS AWESOME!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p243484" date="Posted: Fri Oct 26, 2012 8:18 pm "><author>jmarshall23</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">DoomzRules wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">jmarshall23 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Bunnyhopping, rocketjumping, strafejumping, and running 100 MPHS<br /></div></div><br /><br />Out of all the senseless rambling that you posted, these are the only mechanics you brought up and none of them have any place in a single player environment.

There's already 101 remakes of Doom 1 &amp; 2 out there, let alone all the reworks of doom3 gameplay.  Doomzrule, you'll need to pitch something for more original (see: realistic) to get people interested in helping.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p243568" date="Posted: Sat Oct 27, 2012 8:00 am "><author>chimueloeldragon2011</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Well look, I'm not here to bitch about whether your mod caught my interest or not. First let me tell you your project is quite far fetched, not impossible of course, but something that would take ages to be completed, considering you want to remake EVERY aspect of the game (monsters, weapons, maps and what not). That would as well imply a huge team. Also, you said your skills with the Doom 3 engine were limited. Mine are as well, but at least I do know just a little bit about it. I see you really want to make this and you show you are interested, I like that, but on the other hand you would really need to get some basic knowledge before you launch yourself into something that big.<br />Also, make sure there are no contradictions. You just wrote this:<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Iron Sights we need, not only to appeal to this generation... but to also make the game feel realistic.<br /><br />Bunnyhopping, rocketjumping, strafejumping, and running 100 MPHS... that's a must!</div><br /><br />Yes, as said, those two are contradictions...<br /><br />Anyway, I'm posting here because I've been working on a continuation project for Classic Doom back in 2009/2010, with a member of this board and a small group of people (modellers, animators) I did'nt have the pleasure to chat with (*I mean, I actually knew they were on the team because of my friend). Unfortunatelly the project didn't make it far, but we got some things done.<br />If you want I can upload some of the assets, I still have some of the maps we did, most of which are incomplete. But it's something. If I wasn't working on my mod (which I really enjoy) I would for sure help you at least in the mapping field.<br />Cheers, and good luck.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p243575" date="Posted: Sat Oct 27, 2012 11:30 am "><author>obihb</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">You win...<br /><br />Dumbest post on the internet....   ever..</div>]]></body></post><post id="p243576" date="Posted: Sat Oct 27, 2012 11:37 am "><author>vertex007</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">the classic DOOM mod is already not bad, not perfect but really not bad......., it's DOOM but with tech4 and all the assets/models/textures of D3 and with a bit of knowledge and tweaking you can run it with sikkmod and/or replace the music with your own choice...

No, you would NOT want to have them as finals.</div><br />Speaking of carelessly running an image through CrazyBump, nobody mentions projects like The Dark Mod or Hexen, a couple of projects with which someone could easily point out some hideous texture work.  The Dark Mod actually agreeing with itself on this, which is very commendable and professional.  I think it's extremely rare.  It doesn't hide under a veil with nothing but a finger surfacing to blame every else for its own shortcomings.  Nonetheless, bad texture work can be seen.<br /><br />But when THEY do it, "Oh that's just temporary, yadda yadda, that will be fixed later, yadda PR yadda..."  It's the WORST of what they can do, so stay tuned folks, you're gonna be SO sorry!  It's like "It's _because_ we're so great, that we don't need to actually be great, because our board of officials are on luxurious vacations already.  Understand it, people."<br /><br />When others do it, "WATCH OUT something stinky, that is DEFINITELY their best, they worked on that 1 texture for five years and LOOK, that's all they could ever possibly do, are you now or have you ever been, avoid, avert, arrest..."  "And I should know, because I just know..."<br /><br />Someone would never try to boycott and rail down on something that legitimately is no threat to them.  If it's fail, why not let it out of the cage to prove it will actually fail.  Smashing the door in its face only makes it seem like there's actually something to fear.  I think most people are aware of this, whether they say it or not.<br /><br />This is what's known as a double-standard.  It's real hypocrisy and very sad, because only those few will ever give a damn about it anyway, and shows this is actually a very insular little community now and has almost no bearing on what happens elsewhere anymore.  A shock to some.  Some people here act as though they coded the Doom3 alpha all by themselves and everyone owes them for everything, when actually nobody really cares anyway.  This is "A forum", not "THE forum" as it once seemed.  People barely cared in the first place, honestly.  So when people compete against people who admit they are facing challenges, asking modestly for help, and not even ready to compete yet - BAM! - get shot straight out of the sky.  This can only be called insecurity on behalf of people who by now should know better, should have gotten older and wiser, otherwise they would find more worthy opponents to focus on, not always waiting to blast their bazookas at the paper ducks.  They wouldn't even be there to begin with.  They'd be too busy working on their projects to have a spare thought or any spare time.  The fact some people rail down on others at all says a lot about that.<br /><br />At the end of the day, competing with people who are not even in the race is analogous to masturbation, and railing down on someone else will not make their own incoming criticisms vanish into thin air.  You don't respond to others criticisms of your dancing skills by pointing out the kid in the wheelchair in the audience.  You don't win a race by standing at the starting line and shooting your opponents in the back as they begin running, because then it's not a race anymore, for posterity, it's nothing but a bunch of pathetic losers.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p245007" date="Posted: Wed Dec 26, 2012 11:34 am "><author>Gazado</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">As a basic level of respect for the team who worked on Classic Doom 3 mod, please do not use the mod as a base of any kind.

NO PDA'S, NO AUDIO LOGS, NO TEXT LOGS, Storage Lockers open, DOOM 1 Looking Shotgun. More realistic weapon sounds and look. No more shrieking from the Imps! No flashlight, more action, tons of blood and gore (but not to the point where the PC lags)<br /><br />And once we make DOOM 3 like that.<br /><br />We make Ressurection of Evil like that.<br /><br />We make The Lost Mission like that.<br /><br /><br />And <span style="color: #FF0000">DOOM 1 and 2</span> This is where everyone... comes together to make one huge mod.... a remake of DOOM 1 and 2.

It should be very atmospheric and emulate the feel of the Classic Resident Evil games.<br /><br /><br />DOOM 1 and 2 remade on the DOOM 3 engine... it should take advantage of the modern technology, such as non-center screen weapons. Reloading is a must, however it must be short quick reload animations nothing fancy, we don't need COD styled "LOOK AT ME TAKING FOREVER HURH HURH!" Goldeneye Reloading is an option. You could do Goldeneye N64 Reload Animations or Simple Quick Animations.<br /><br />Iron Sights we need, not only to appeal to this generation... but to also make the game feel realistic.<br /><br /><br />Bunnyhopping, rocketjumping, strafejumping, and running 100 MPHS... that's a must!<br /><br />We need tons of blood and gore but not to the point were the PC lags...<br /><br /><br />We need much more ragdoll physics implemented.<br /><br />Destructible enviroments.<br /><br />Make the monsters look 10000X scarier. It's 2012... we can make high-poly models of the sprites right guys?<br /><br />Also, we can take a vote... I believe in a democratic system..<br /><br /><br />All in favor of center screen weapons for DOOM 1 and 2 Remake say: DOOM IS FUCKING AWESOME!<br /><br />All those NOT in favor of center screen weapons for DOOM 1 and 2 Remake say: DOOM 3 IS AWESOME!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p243484" date="Posted: Fri Oct 26, 2012 8:18 pm "><author>jmarshall23</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">DoomzRules wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">jmarshall23 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Bunnyhopping, rocketjumping, strafejumping, and running 100 MPHS<br /></div></div><br /><br />Out of all the senseless rambling that you posted, these are the only mechanics you brought up and none of them have any place in a single player environment.

First let me tell you your project is quite far fetched, not impossible of course, but something that would take ages to be completed, considering you want to remake EVERY aspect of the game (monsters, weapons, maps and what not). That would as well imply a huge team. Also, you said your skills with the Doom 3 engine were limited. Mine are as well, but at least I do know just a little bit about it. I see you really want to make this and you show you are interested, I like that, but on the other hand you would really need to get some basic knowledge before you launch yourself into something that big.<br />Also, make sure there are no contradictions. You just wrote this:<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Iron Sights we need, not only to appeal to this generation... but to also make the game feel realistic.<br /><br />Bunnyhopping, rocketjumping, strafejumping, and running 100 MPHS... that's a must!</div><br /><br />Yes, as said, those two are contradictions...<br /><br />Anyway, I'm posting here because I've been working on a continuation project for Classic Doom back in 2009/2010, with a member of this board and a small group of people (modellers, animators) I did'nt have the pleasure to chat with (*I mean, I actually knew they were on the team because of my friend). Unfortunatelly the project didn't make it far, but we got some things done.<br />If you want I can upload some of the assets, I still have some of the maps we did, most of which are incomplete. But it's something. If I wasn't working on my mod (which I really enjoy) I would for sure help you at least in the mapping field.<br />Cheers, and good luck.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p243575" date="Posted: Sat Oct 27, 2012 11:30 am "><author>obihb</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">You win...<br /><br />Dumbest post on the internet....   ever..</div>]]></body></post><post id="p243576" date="Posted: Sat Oct 27, 2012 11:37 am "><author>vertex007</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">the classic DOOM mod is already not bad, not perfect but really not bad......., it's DOOM but with tech4 and all the assets/models/textures of D3 and with a bit of knowledge and tweaking you can run it with sikkmod and/or replace the music with your own choice...

No, you would NOT want to have them as finals.</div><br />Speaking of carelessly running an image through CrazyBump, nobody mentions projects like The Dark Mod or Hexen, a couple of projects with which someone could easily point out some hideous texture work.  The Dark Mod actually agreeing with itself on this, which is very commendable and professional.  I think it's extremely rare.  It doesn't hide under a veil with nothing but a finger surfacing to blame every else for its own shortcomings.  Nonetheless, bad texture work can be seen.<br /><br />But when THEY do it, "Oh that's just temporary, yadda yadda, that will be fixed later, yadda PR yadda..."  It's the WORST of what they can do, so stay tuned folks, you're gonna be SO sorry!  It's like "It's _because_ we're so great, that we don't need to actually be great, because our board of officials are on luxurious vacations already.  Understand it, people."<br /><br />When others do it, "WATCH OUT something stinky, that is DEFINITELY their best, they worked on that 1 texture for five years and LOOK, that's all they could ever possibly do, are you now or have you ever been, avoid, avert, arrest..."  "And I should know, because I just know..."<br /><br />Someone would never try to boycott and rail down on something that legitimately is no threat to them.  If it's fail, why not let it out of the cage to prove it will actually fail.  Smashing the door in its face only makes it seem like there's actually something to fear.  I think most people are aware of this, whether they say it or not.<br /><br />This is what's known as a double-standard.  It's real hypocrisy and very sad, because only those few will ever give a damn about it anyway, and shows this is actually a very insular little community now and has almost no bearing on what happens elsewhere anymore.  A shock to some.  Some people here act as though they coded the Doom3 alpha all by themselves and everyone owes them for everything, when actually nobody really cares anyway.  This is "A forum", not "THE forum" as it once seemed.  People barely cared in the first place, honestly.  So when people compete against people who admit they are facing challenges, asking modestly for help, and not even ready to compete yet - BAM! - get shot straight out of the sky.  This can only be called insecurity on behalf of people who by now should know better, should have gotten older and wiser, otherwise they would find more worthy opponents to focus on, not always waiting to blast their bazookas at the paper ducks.  They wouldn't even be there to begin with.  They'd be too busy working on their projects to have a spare thought or any spare time.  The fact some people rail down on others at all says a lot about that.<br /><br />At the end of the day, competing with people who are not even in the race is analogous to masturbation, and railing down on someone else will not make their own incoming criticisms vanish into thin air.  You don't respond to others criticisms of your dancing skills by pointing out the kid in the wheelchair in the audience.  You don't win a race by standing at the starting line and shooting your opponents in the back as they begin running, because then it's not a race anymore, for posterity, it's nothing but a bunch of pathetic losers.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p245007" date="Posted: Wed Dec 26, 2012 11:34 am "><author>Gazado</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">As a basic level of respect for the team who worked on Classic Doom 3 mod, please do not use the mod as a base of any kind. Please do download, play through and look at the base assets to learn how we put it together, however please do not redistribute the mod assets as your own work, in whole or in part, with another modification.<br /><br />We spent 3-4 years working on the project in our spare time, I am sure some members of the team would be happy for you to make use of their work on an individual basis, however there will also be members who are not. As a single, complete project, it would be most sensible to not make use of it's creative assets as it would be impossible to obtain direct permission from the individual team members (I don't have all of their contact details).<br /><br />To reiterate, please do look at the assets and learn from them to create your own, new assets, but please do not re-use or release the Classic Doom 3 work in any new projects.</div>]]></body></post></posts></thread></xml>
