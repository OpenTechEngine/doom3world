Does it have an invinsible frame where it can't be harmed? Often I shoot at it during its charge-up with that funky green stuff and it doesn't hurt it.<br /><br />Does anyone know what exactly does that green stuff do to the Grunt? Faster movement, higher health, higher damage, faster attack, etc.?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p213589" date="Posted: Mon Apr 13, 2009 10:54 am "><author>Tetzlaff</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Looking at the .def file it seems that he performs a leap attack with double damage after doping himself up...<br /><br />I wonder under which circumstances he fires his shoulder mounted chaingun, I think it only happened once during the game.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p213600" date="Posted: Mon Apr 13, 2009 6:50 pm "><author>Sikkpin</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Yeah, the first time playing through Q4, I though the grunt was melee only. But for him to fire his canon, you just need to keep you distance and if he can't get to you quickly (obstacles, whatever..), he'll fire. It surprised me the first time he did it.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p213955" date="Posted: Fri Apr 24, 2009 10:50 am "><author>Tetzlaff</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">That´s interesting. I´m just replaying Quake4 now and notice some nice details I haven´t noticed the first time. Like the Berserker´s medium-range lightning attack (not the floor-pounding attack, but the one where he uses is electrified spike arm).</div>]]></body></post></posts></thread></xml>
