Pardon the shameless plug, but the shoutcasting crew I work with over at EnemyTerritory.tv went to QuakeCon this year and we've been slowly getting all of our content out to the masses over the last few days (we had no useful bandwidth for uploading large vids while at QCon).

Could you tell if the audio feed is just the audio channel of the video? Because the last half hour of that is almost imperceptible, it's like JC was giving his keynote in a busy restaurant. It's not your fault obviously people that people start to leave the room and, apparently, play cards? during the keynote. I just wanted to know if there's any point in downloading the 1.2gb video if it's not any clearer than the audio feed. Thanks again man.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p203316" date="Posted: Thu Aug 07, 2008 9:19 pm "><author>goliathvt</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Hey folks.
