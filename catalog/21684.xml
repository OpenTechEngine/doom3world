I don't even think money is an issue anymore they just spam out titles for a publisher so they pub can stay in biz dollingout money to the devs to make more crap.....</div>]]></body></post><post id="p201655" date="Posted: Fri Jul 11, 2008 3:30 am "><author>Darkr0nin</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">ZippyDSMlee wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">Darkr0nin wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I also throughly enjoyed SS2, for different reasons.

The most glaring example would be the tommy gun. The recoil makes it practically useless even when burst firing until you upgrade it with recoil reduction. Not to mention the photograph based missions felt a bit too much like a grind. It ran slow, but this is no fault of the game, my computer has some pretty dated hardware. Other than that I quite enjoyed it. Modding it would be amazing.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p201657" date="Posted: Fri Jul 11, 2008 3:36 am "><author>ZippyDSMlee</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Darkr0nin wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">ZippyDSMlee wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">Darkr0nin wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I also throughly enjoyed SS2, for different reasons.

Turok EVO is better than this 0-o</div>]]></body></post></posts></thread></xml>
