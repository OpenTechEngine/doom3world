This update includes a host of features such as: refined hitboxes, optimized sound and network code, configurable fps caps, weapon balancing, server direct autodownloading, and addonpak fixes, to name only a few. We are especially excited to introduce our new spectator support to Quake 4 - Q4TV. The majority of our additions have been included thanks to direct community feedback. Your continued feedback on this beta will be greatly appreciated - <!-- e --><a href="mailto:q4bugs@idsoftware.com">q4bugs@idsoftware.com</a><!-- e -->&#13;<br /><br />We hope everyone enjoys the new content, features and fixes! For a more complete list of changes, please see the README&#13;<br /><br />The 1.4 beta update affects pure server and protocol consistency. Therefore, players who update to 1.4 beta from ANY previous version will only be able to connect and play against other 1.4 beta users. Save games and demos created on any previous version of the game will not be compatible with the 1.4 beta update.&#13;<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.idsoftware.com/" class="postlink">DOWNLOAD</a></div>]]></body></post><post id="p169953" date="Posted: Thu Feb 08, 2007 1:24 am "><author>Bittoman</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Also three new maps <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />  One Q3 remake (umm...Camping Grounds?), one ctf and one tourney.

They've made changes as requested by mod authors to allocate the clientNum for bots, which will also have the effect of making the bots visible externally.&#13;<br /><br />Edit: Ignore comments on userinfo.... it was the UserCmd it was getting, so that theres a consistent way of feeding the input into the engine.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p170033" date="Posted: Thu Feb 08, 2007 11:41 pm "><author>Mordenkainen</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Hopefully ladders work again in MP.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p170673" date="Posted: Thu Feb 15, 2007 9:27 pm "><author>ensiform</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">You have to enable them via code. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p171195" date="Posted: Thu Feb 22, 2007 6:44 am "><author>Mordenkainen</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">ensiform wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">You have to enable them via code. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" /></div>&#13;<br /><br />I'll never again do a custom map that uses a custom game DLL.

I'm getting constant, consistent, reproducible crashes, all over the place.&#13;<br /><br />In the opening cutscene, as the hatch in the floor of the hangar below the dropship containing Rhino Squad opens, I get a consistent crash there.&#13;<br /><br />Pass through the first door just after the first autosave point, assuming I skip the opening cutscene; crash.&#13;<br /><br />hit anything directly with the napalm launcher, crash.&#13;<br /><br />Sometimes it'll crash as I "Click to continue" after a map load.&#13;<br /><br />Anyone else getting this? Anyone else figured out a workaround?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p178035" date="Posted: Sun May 13, 2007 10:14 am "><author>AnthonyJa</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I believe there is a known issue with the latest patch and singleplayer.
