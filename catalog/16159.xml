I'm in the process of learning how to use it, and I did the old crappy subdivided extruded cube already. So I figured I'd try a semi-complex object. So I made a low poly tall cylinder, and modelled some simple horizontal grooves, and rings. Then I made a high poly version of that object and made the grooves/rings highly detailed and smooth, then sent it out to renderbump.
<br /><br />The problem I'm having is weird vertical seams forming in the renderbump (<span style="font-weight: bold">see a section of the renderbump below</span>). The low poly is a 16 sided cylinder, the high poly is 96 sided. When I use this renderbump ingame on the model it makes it look like it has 96 facets, each one having it's own shadow/hilight. So it looks VERY unsmooth. However, if I just make a flat bumpmap in Photoshop for that area, the cylinder looks perfectly smooth ingame. I'm just not quite sure what I'm doing wrong to get a nice smooth cyclinder render like on the stock Q4 models.
<br /><br />Note: I've tried using the ingame renderbump, as well as orb. Both yield the same results so it must be something I'm doing wrong. Also for what it's worth, I'm using Blender v2.41.
