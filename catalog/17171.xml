<br />it says:
<br /><br />"The files have to be processed using a built in tool to convert the Maya files to .md5mesh and .md5anim files."
<br /><br />but unfortunately i could not find this tool in the doom3 sdk.

<br />luckily i have quake4, so i started the console using Quake3Ded.exe and tried to export a sample model using:
<br /><br />exportModels test.def
<br /><br />which gives me this output:
<br /><br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">]reexportmodels test.def<br />Converting md5/berserker_ref.ma to C:/Programme/id Software/Quake 4/q4base/md5/berserker_ref.md5mesh...<br />Loading file...<br />Creating joints...<br />Creating meshes...<br />WARNING: file C:/Programme/id Software/Quake 4/q4base/def/test.def, line 4: Failed to export 'C:/Programme/id Software/Quake 4/q4base/md5/berserker_ref.ma' : kObjectNameFilter: Error getting skin cluster ((kInvalidParameter): Object is incompatible with this method)<br /></div>
<br /><br />does anyone know what the problem could be? i tried mb files and ma files exported from Maya6.0.
<br /><br />edit: i have now also been trying to use the models from the Q4SDK, but it gives me the same error.  here is my simple def file:
<br /><br />export test_neu {
<br />	options -sourcedir md5 -destdir md5
<br />	mesh    berserker_ref.ma

<br /><br />the last week i have been trying it from different games which use the doom3 engine, but without any success.
<br /><br />either the game crashes, the above error message occurs, or nothing happens at all.
<br /><br />is there no other way to create MD5s out of Maya?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p158292" date="Posted: Wed Sep 27, 2006 1:17 pm "><author>elusive</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Hm first of all don't use spaces in filename or paths.
<br />I think the error you got has something to do with the weight maps of the model. I can remember that some of our animators got that message some months ago. He binded the skeleton to the model again and it worked. 
<br />I'm not sure it's the same problem here. Doom 3 can be very creative when it comes to error messages</div>]]></body></post><post id="p156831" date="Posted: Tue Sep 12, 2006 9:21 am "><author>ehmdjii</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">hello,
