Would appreciate help on this one.<br /><br />I just installed Prey, but can't use the editor. Playing the game works fine. And opening the editor and messing around a little works fine as well.

But now I can't find the really old drivers from the ati.com website. <br /><br />So, the question is;<br /><br />Does anyone know where to get the Radeon 9800 pro drivers from early 2006?
