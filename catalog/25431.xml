I have been toiling with this for weeks, now. I went out and bought this 7900 GTX card to replace the onboard GeForce 6150 SE, but have no relief.<br /><br />PLEASE HELP!!!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p238518" date="Posted: Sun Apr 22, 2012 6:23 am "><author>doomtrinity</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Hi,<br /><br />You said this ( BTW, why not just updating the previous topic? ),<br /><div class="quotetitle">blairwag wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">downer wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I'm usually terrible about giving advice, but this thread is still going without an answer.<br />I looked up your hardware and that card and motherboard seem to both be the old PCIE 1.0, so you should be ok. Have you disabled the onboard graphics in the BIOS? Just grabbing at straws now, but is this the first time that computer had a graphics card and maybe the power supply came free with a cheap case?</div><br /><br />I appreciate your help. The only bad advice is the thoughtfulness not given. So, thank you!<br /><br />I have definitely successfully disabled the onboard geforce graphics. I had the same concern you did. But, all drivers are removed, and it doesn't show in the hardware manager - not even as an unknown device.</div><br />I've took a look to the manual of your Motherboard here, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319222405/http://www.asus.com/Motherboards/AMD_AM2/M2NMX_SE_Plus/#download" class="postlink">http://www.asus.com/Motherboards/AMD_AM2/M2NMX_SE_Plus/#download</a>, and it seems that you cannot disable the onboard graphics adapter, but you can set the priority of the graphics device. You should go in the "Advanced" section and check the display device priority, you should have something like [PCIE -&gt; PCI -&gt; IGP].</div>]]></body></post><post id="p238533" date="Posted: Mon Apr 23, 2012 4:29 pm "><author>blairwag</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanx for the reply. I started a new thread to get rid of the "6150 se" concern all together and focus on the 7900 GTX.<br /><br />Yup. The motherboard comes with e GeForce 6150 se integrated video component. And, the only way to "disable it" is to change the priority in the BIOS to select the PCIe slot first( [PCIE -&gt; PCI -&gt; IGP] ), and put a PCIe video card in it. Additionally, I made sure to remove any 6150 drivers. Now, Windows recognizes only the 7900 GTX, so I'm pretty confident I've ensured the 6150 isn't causing any problems. Could I be missing something?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p238535" date="Posted: Tue Apr 24, 2012 12:50 am "><author>tbelvin</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">It appears like your processor isn't fully supported even with the latest motherboard bios.<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319222405/http://vip.asus.com/forum/view.aspx?board_id=1&amp;model=M2N-MX+SE+PLUS&amp;id=20081202195345375&amp;page=1&amp;SLanguage=en-us">http://vip.asus.com/forum/view.aspx?boa ... uage=en-us</a><!-- m --></div>]]></body></post><post id="p238540" date="Posted: Tue Apr 24, 2012 2:53 pm "><author>blairwag</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Holy Crow!!! tbelvin - thank you SO MUCH!

Device Manufactures(*cough* ati) are natoreous for writing bad drivers, esp when it comes to OpenGL integration(which doesn't have to comply with a set standard like MS forces with DirectX), so each iteration of there drivers stuff gets fixes/implemeneted on a regular basis. So it will def be in your best interest to upgrade your video drivers, at the very least you might get a awesome speed up : ).</div>]]></body></post><post id="p238722" date="Posted: Thu May 03, 2012 2:36 pm "><author>blairwag</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I hear ya regarding keeping drivers current.  However, I've read a LOT out there where folks have found that Nvidia has made enhancements to their video drivers to improve performance of newer games, but at the expense of the older ones.  Something about the "shader" version. Now, I'm no expert, so please forgive my ignorance and/or improper terms.  Older games using version 1.1 seem to be suffering now with newer drivers.  I've read quite a bit and found that most folks find the 182.50 to be the last version for this card the Nvidia supported the older games. current drivers are at version 296.10.<br /><br />So, I'm a little nervous about upgrading the drivers.  first, I'm going to let me son have some fun playing this damned game. Then, I plan on installing the 182.50.  Will test that.  Then, will install the latest 296.10.  If performance suffers, I'll drop back down.  this may take a week or two, but I'll post my results in this forum.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p238517" date="Posted: Sun Apr 22, 2012 1:49 am "><author>blairwag</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Running Doom3, even on the lowest Doom3 video settings stalls every 15-20 seconds of play for about 10-15 seconds.<br /><br />Symptom: start running Doom3 Recruit (with showFPS = "1").

I have been toiling with this for weeks, now. I went out and bought this 7900 GTX card to replace the onboard GeForce 6150 SE, but have no relief.<br /><br />PLEASE HELP!!!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p238518" date="Posted: Sun Apr 22, 2012 6:23 am "><author>doomtrinity</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Hi,<br /><br />You said this ( BTW, why not just updating the previous topic? ),<br /><div class="quotetitle">blairwag wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">downer wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I'm usually terrible about giving advice, but this thread is still going without an answer.<br />I looked up your hardware and that card and motherboard seem to both be the old PCIE 1.0, so you should be ok. Have you disabled the onboard graphics in the BIOS? Just grabbing at straws now, but is this the first time that computer had a graphics card and maybe the power supply came free with a cheap case?</div><br /><br />I appreciate your help. The only bad advice is the thoughtfulness not given. So, thank you!<br /><br />I have definitely successfully disabled the onboard geforce graphics. I had the same concern you did. But, all drivers are removed, and it doesn't show in the hardware manager - not even as an unknown device.</div><br />I've took a look to the manual of your Motherboard here, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319223007/http://www.asus.com/Motherboards/AMD_AM2/M2NMX_SE_Plus/#download" class="postlink">http://www.asus.com/Motherboards/AMD_AM2/M2NMX_SE_Plus/#download</a>, and it seems that you cannot disable the onboard graphics adapter, but you can set the priority of the graphics device. You should go in the "Advanced" section and check the display device priority, you should have something like [PCIE -&gt; PCI -&gt; IGP].</div>]]></body></post><post id="p238533" date="Posted: Mon Apr 23, 2012 4:29 pm "><author>blairwag</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanx for the reply. I started a new thread to get rid of the "6150 se" concern all together and focus on the 7900 GTX.<br /><br />Yup. The motherboard comes with e GeForce 6150 se integrated video component. And, the only way to "disable it" is to change the priority in the BIOS to select the PCIe slot first( [PCIE -&gt; PCI -&gt; IGP] ), and put a PCIe video card in it. Additionally, I made sure to remove any 6150 drivers. Now, Windows recognizes only the 7900 GTX, so I'm pretty confident I've ensured the 6150 isn't causing any problems. Could I be missing something?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p238535" date="Posted: Tue Apr 24, 2012 12:50 am "><author>tbelvin</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">It appears like your processor isn't fully supported even with the latest motherboard bios.<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319223007/http://vip.asus.com/forum/view.aspx?board_id=1&amp;model=M2N-MX+SE+PLUS&amp;id=20081202195345375&amp;page=1&amp;SLanguage=en-us">http://vip.asus.com/forum/view.aspx?boa ... uage=en-us</a><!-- m --></div>]]></body></post><post id="p238540" date="Posted: Tue Apr 24, 2012 2:53 pm "><author>blairwag</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Holy Crow!!! tbelvin - thank you SO MUCH!  I may not like it, but at least I have something to go on.<br />I never, in a million years, would have expected a CPU to MB compatibility issue.<br />I never would have thought to go to the ASUS forums - guess I need to broaden my horizons.<br />I am so grateful and so thankful to you (tbelvin) for considering my problem, looking into it, and for any research you did.<br />Knowing the problem is half the battle.  Man, I was so close to giving up. Now, I have new hope and new life!<br />OK - off to ASUS to find a solution.<br /><br />I love this forum and all of you who contribute! tbelvin, you rock!<br /><br />I will post my progress and eventual solution for the benefit of others.

Device Manufactures(*cough* ati) are natoreous for writing bad drivers, esp when it comes to OpenGL integration(which doesn't have to comply with a set standard like MS forces with DirectX), so each iteration of there drivers stuff gets fixes/implemeneted on a regular basis. So it will def be in your best interest to upgrade your video drivers, at the very least you might get a awesome speed up : ).</div>]]></body></post><post id="p238722" date="Posted: Thu May 03, 2012 2:36 pm "><author>blairwag</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I hear ya regarding keeping drivers current.  However, I've read a LOT out there where folks have found that Nvidia has made enhancements to their video drivers to improve performance of newer games, but at the expense of the older ones.  Something about the "shader" version. Now, I'm no expert, so please forgive my ignorance and/or improper terms.  Older games using version 1.1 seem to be suffering now with newer drivers.  I've read quite a bit and found that most folks find the 182.50 to be the last version for this card the Nvidia supported the older games. current drivers are at version 296.10.<br /><br />So, I'm a little nervous about upgrading the drivers.  first, I'm going to let me son have some fun playing this damned game. Then, I plan on installing the 182.50.  Will test that.  Then, will install the latest 296.10.  If performance suffers, I'll drop back down.  this may take a week or two, but I'll post my results in this forum.</div>]]></body></post></posts></thread></xml>
