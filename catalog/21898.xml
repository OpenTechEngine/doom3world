Their proof is your internet Address showing that your Internet address downloaded said file on said date.  They have the address, time, date, MD5 checksum of the file downloaded, size,  etc.  To refute that you need to go through hoops to prove that it wasn't you, and so far the law is not up to par with technology.  Its your burden to show then why and how this file was transferred over your Internet connection if it wasn't you getting the file.
