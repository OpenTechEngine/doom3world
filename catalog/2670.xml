<br /><br />I did include one higher poly version because people might want to look at it and learn.
<br /><br />What do you mean with incomplete? Please be more specific.
<br /><br />The small ones are the versions I use in LightWave (different grid units).
<br />Later on I scale the model up to be game ready.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p26736" date="Posted: Wed Jul 21, 2004 12:59 am "><author>eskimo roll</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Has any made any linkage buttons for external sites usong the doom3world.org <span class="posthilit">logo</span>, I'd suggest white &amp; black versions maybe along with a psd that can be used to make any background colour.
<br /><br />additional hits from external linkage would help to get better search engine ratings.

<br /><br />Buttons are a good idea, but the problem is that other Doom3 sites fear to loose hits by linking us.
<br /><br />There are only very few sitest who currently link to Doom3world.
<br /><br />It's been much more, but a few people, traceable back to come from a certain corner of the web, made sure to email every webmaster in the world to ensure that a link to Doom3world.org get's removed.
<br /><br />I'm currently doing a lot of backoffice work for <span class="posthilit">D3W</span> - when I'm done our external link rating will be much better again.
<br /><br />And - Google doesn't really like phpBB urls, there are mods which rewrite the output url's for Google, but it's not worth the hassle.
<br /><br />Still we're listed on dmoz which is always a good thing:

<br /><br />Somebody made a nice small button one day, don't know where I have it...
<br /><br />Everybody: 
<br />feel free to have fun with our <span class="posthilit">logo</span> and make something cool with it, even better - something funny.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p26749" date="Posted: Wed Jul 21, 2004 8:00 am "><author>Zenix</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">This site show's up on Google...
