<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Some basics first</span>: Hold Shift+click to select objects, ESC to deselect everything, CTRL+Shift+click to select faces to use different textures on the same brush.
<br /><br />The map: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100522175331/http://w1.313.telia.com/~u31309293/doorGUI.map" class="postlink">http://w1.313.telia.com/~u31309293/doorGUI.map</a>
<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 125%; line-height: normal"><span style="font-weight: bold">1.</span></span>
<br />Create the door with whatever you want, brushes or models (<span style="font-style: italic">right-click on the grid and press New Model and choose any of the base/models/mapobjects/doors</span>)
<br /> + a model that can use GUIs and add one of those with the "Gui..." button in the Entity Edit Window (<span style="font-style: italic">New Model - any base/models/mapobjects/guiobject</span>)
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100522175331/http://w1.313.telia.com/~u31309293/1.gif" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100522175331im_/http://w1.313.telia.com/~u31309293/1-1.gif" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 125%; line-height: normal"><span style="font-weight: bold">2.</span></span>
<br />Select the GUI entity first and then the doors. Now press CTRL+K to add the doors as targets for the GUI.
<br /><br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100522175331/http://w1.313.telia.com/~u31309293/3.gif" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100522175331im_/http://w1.313.telia.com/~u31309293/3-3.gif" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br /><br />Make sure your doors are locked = 1 or 2, unless you want to close the doors with the button.
<br /><br /><br />I hope this will help someone who has a hard time figuring this out (like me).
<br /><br />Please comment on anything i said wrong or whatever, this is my first time with a game editor.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p30506" date="Posted: Sun Aug 08, 2004 8:15 am "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Nice one - try to explain every image to greater depth, I can imagine people new to this to stumble into problems <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100522175331im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p30588" date="Posted: Sun Aug 08, 2004 11:46 am "><author>Burrito</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Nice one, thanks.

<br /><br />If you target the relay trigger first then the func_static with the gui the static won't send the command to the relay so you got to target the static first then the relay.
<br /><br />Also in my test you don't need the relay_trigger. If you target the static with the gui and then the func_doors and hit crtl k the static will set target to them.
<br /><br />Also was wondering in anyone figured out the keypads yet?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p31024" date="Posted: Mon Aug 09, 2004 3:05 am "><author>MisterCrow</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Ok how the heck did you make those saucerlamps on the ceiling project lights around the map? I've been messing around with this crap for a good hour or two and I can't get this crap to behave like it's supposed to.
<br /><br />I can't figure out how to get the light to cast from somewhere OTHER than the top (center isn't working)...it's REAL simple but geez this editor makes it a HUGE chore to figure this out.
<br /><br />Make a light --&gt; Click model --&gt; Choose saucerlamp --&gt; Position --&gt; Rotate / Tilt --&gt; Change light type to projection --&gt; Adjust (near-impossible to adjust with the notches on the 2D views) --&gt; Something.
<br /><br />That doesn't work...what am I doing wrong?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p31352" date="Posted: Mon Aug 09, 2004 2:37 pm "><author>Njal</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">How do i lock the door once it's closes?
<br />So if i don't run through it when i unlock and open it it locks again and i have to press the button. Also to lock the door once you're through so you can't get back.
<br /><br />I suck at all kinds of programing and I'm lazy so if scripting is need please just hand me the code <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100522175331im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p31437" date="Posted: Mon Aug 09, 2004 5:30 pm "><author>Njal</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Here's how far I've gotten:
<br /><br />I can open the doors with the GUI, and when they close they are locked with the help of '<span style="font-style: italic">triggerClosed</span>' and the target '<span style="font-style: italic">target_lock</span>' but how do i reset the GUI so the button appears again when the doors are locked again?
<br /><br />I'm using the guis/admin/admincontrol.gui with a 'Security Override' button to do stuff but once you press it there is no other button to press to unlock again.

<br />The trouble I had with the tutorial is the trigger relay. It wasn't mentioned in the tutorial (though it is in the images) The tutorial still helped a bunch, sine I am very new. Looking at the map itself helped. Is the trigger relay generated automatically? I'll list the steps I did to get it to work. for the inexperienced (Like me)  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100522175331im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" /><br /><br />Right-Click&gt;function&gt;func_door
<br />   in the entity tab for door click model, choose  
<br />           models/mapobjects/doors/door of your choice
<br />           clone door(space), delete old func-door (maybe just bug for me,
<br />           but door  doesn't show up if i don't do this)
<br />           add lock variable set to 1 or 2
<br /><br />Right-Click&gt;new model&gt;model with a gui
<br />           i chose models/mapobjects/filler/laptop.lwo
<br />           click the gui button under entity tab, add gui
<br />           i chose guis/alphalabs1/securitystation.gui
<br /><br />Right-Click&gt;trigger&gt;trigger relay
<br /><br />Hit esc to make sure everything is clear
<br /><br />Select gui object (entity) and then select trigger relay.  hit Ctrl+k
<br /><br />Hit esc
<br /><br />Select trigger relay the func door entity. hit Ctrl+k
<br /><br />And thats what worked for me. Still trying to be able to lock and unlock the door repeatedly. This just unlocks and keeps it unlocked. How is that done? Any ideas?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p35477" date="Posted: Sat Aug 14, 2004 8:02 pm "><author>psychonub</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">paynterDigital wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">And thats what worked for me.

<br /><br />iam having the sameproblem with the keycode doors, once it is unlocked enter the code again and it says it is locked, but is not.
<br /><br />what is the trigger_relay for? on my door all i did was fill out the gui_parm and then made the target the door name.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p36353" date="Posted: Mon Aug 16, 2004 10:43 am "><author>Demigod</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">A friendly bump as I would like to know how to have doors relock/ be opened multiple times off a gui</div>]]></body></post><post id="p37905" date="Posted: Wed Aug 18, 2004 8:13 pm "><author>gunwolf</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Tried the tutorial step by step by <span style="font-weight: bold">paynterDigital</span> above but couldn't get it to work. 
<br />Door started off and remain unlocked 
<br />and the GUI interface just made the door sound as I clicked it - door did nothing.
