<br /><br />The most important thing: "Q4" 1.3 or 1.4.0 is needed to play the map (1.4.1 has problems with a sp mode).

But the implementation of the cutscene and the idea with those guys and searchlights was pretty cool. The rest of the map was, as already mentioned, short but sweet. For me the length isn't really a downside. And I liked the bossfight, although I was in godmode then.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081120191559im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p194922" date="Posted: Wed Feb 13, 2008 3:28 pm "><author>ajm113</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">der_ton wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">although I was in godmode then.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081120191559im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" /></div><br /><br />I have one word about that.<br /><br />CHEATER!!!   <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081120191559im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p178184" date="Posted: Tue May 15, 2007 1:23 am "><author>Lukin</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">A little single player project for "Quake 4". It took me about 20 days to made the entire thing - even my mp maps were not made that fast so have mercy if you'll find something ugly, etc. 
<br /><br />Anyway I think you may enjoy these few minutes spend on the level. Although the map is not revolutionary by any means there are some surprises which I hope you'll like. 
<br /><br />The most important thing: "Q4" 1.3 or 1.4.0 is needed to play the map (1.4.1 has problems with a sp mode).

The action overall was quite solid, and the layout definitely kept me interested.  Your MP experience has clearly paid off.  The cutscenes were great, I especially liked the lights out section!
<br /><br />This of course is keeping in mind the 3 week timelimit you did this in.  Had this been the product of a normal cycle, I'd certainly be more critical, but for 3 weeks you have don exceptionally well.  Overall the geometry was the clear loser, as the level did have some variety in the designs and like I said, the layout was great!  But the whole look of the level clearly suffered from a lack of polish and detail.  Although the gameplay still managed to be quite entertaining.
<br /><br />I'd say that you should most definitely do another SP level, and this time, a full one!  I'd <span style="font-style: italic">really</span> like to see what you could achieve over a matter of months!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p194504" date="Posted: Sun Feb 03, 2008 8:35 am "><author>ajm113</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I had fun, but I think the first boss level needs to be worked on a tiny bit and after I beaten him.<br /><br />I think their is a trigger event to tell when the door is opened so you could have went to the cute scene. When the player first opened the door. Then teleport the player in front of the door then locking it. The area also kinda need some more cover and or health in a few places. - Just to idiot prof it.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081120191559im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /><br /><br />Very Good Work!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081120191559im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p194919" date="Posted: Wed Feb 13, 2008 2:52 pm "><author>der_ton</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I found the lights out part to be really difficult.
