It's loading my mod when I want to connect to the server, display the connect message,then it's stops,load the original quake 4 and then connect again.I think there is something whit the dll that telling the program which folder to look when It's trying to connect.Or maybe some file is missing and he seek it on the q4base folder.I belive I'm not the only one whit this problem because there is a lot of multiplayer mods.But I don't know where to look and I can't fix it.<br /><br />Thank you for your time. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225114426im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p220052" date="Posted: Tue Nov 03, 2009 12:39 pm "><author>AnthonyJa</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">You need to:<br /><ul><li>place your dll inside a pk4 file (not named pak* or game*, so I would name it "yourmod-game-v1.pk4"), in the directory "yourmod"</li><li>also include in that pk4 file a binary.conf file, which is a text file containing the number "0" (to mean "windows")</li><li>- don't place any other files in that pk4, but make sure that all your other map/textures/def etc are in a pk4 (eg "yourmod-media-v1.pk4")</li><li>- run the server with +set si_pure 1 +set net_serverAllowDownloads 1 +set net_serverDownload 3 +set net_serverDlBaseURL "" +set fs_game yourmod</li></ul><br />The client should now successfully download your mod from your server. <br /><br />I'm guessing you currently aren't pk4'ing the DLL and so the client will instead extract the one from the default game pk4's and use that instead.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p220067" date="Posted: Wed Nov 04, 2009 3:22 pm "><author>Shadowflamez</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I have done it today.I have put all of the files of the mod to a second pk4 file named "cm_pak00.pk4" and in the first pk<br /> -
