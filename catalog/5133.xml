<br /><br />Wow, that was amazing!  The tips for both Wings3D and how to use ORB were perfect.  That's helped me a great deal in moving forward with my modeling.
<br /><br />I'm eagerly awaiting your animation tutorial...
<br /><br />Thanks!

<br /><br />I think it wohld look much better if you add some translucency to the wings (if that´s possible)...
<br /><br />PS: I´m really looking forward to see the animations tutorial <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100522163001im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p45419" date="Posted: Wed Sep 01, 2004 6:55 pm "><author>Brain Trepaning</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Wow, thanks for the tutorial.

<br /><br />I assume this is an attempt at satire !!
<br /><br />I use maya and can follow the Tut perfectly bud.. Keep up the great work</div>]]></body></post><post id="p45771" date="Posted: Thu Sep 02, 2004 1:35 pm "><author>def46</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Unfortunately (because I can't afford it) it IS using Maya.
<br /><br />I tried UV Mapping with Wings 3d yesterday, and while the placing of 'charts' and 'cuts' was a great tool, I realised that the real interesting parts of Levitateme's Video Tutorial that drBadvibes links to, is actually 'welding' back together differents charts of the UV skin after scaling/rotating, making an easier to paint skin, and one with less seams. This I couldnt do in Wings3d, and apparently from the video tutorial the guy switched over to Maya to do all this finetuning. So I switched back to 3DS and editing the UV I was able to move vertices, but I dont know if it's possible to 'weld' skin parts back together like in the video tutorial ?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p46046" date="Posted: Thu Sep 02, 2004 11:54 pm "><author>]-UnderTOW-[</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">uberstonks wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I assume this is an attempt at satire !!</div>

<br /><br />been cutting my teeth yesterday texturing a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100522163001/http://mr2k.3dvf.net/tutorials/max/polygones/tut_crash_bandicoot_05.htm" class="postlink">low poly crash bandicoot</a> from a tutorial. It's the first time I do some serious uv mapping but I've got the hang of Wings3d &amp; max Unwrap UVW. 
<br /><br />However I was wondering how do you deal with mirrored parts ?
<br /><br />For example mirrored hands, legs, torso, even face sometimes if there are no asymmetrical details : you end up with one 'chart' for each side. It's possible to move , rotate them etc exactly the same and overlap them on the UV mesh but is seems very unpractical to me. A workaround I did was cut the whole model in two, organize the charts, stitch here and there, scale and rotate, and then, mirror the model and weld it back in one piece. Then the mirrored parts had the UV charts duplicated properly. 
<br /><br />That seemed unpractical though, I was hoping there is a better way to do this ?
<br /><br />PPS: also noticed after export from Wings3D back to 3DS, I lost the smoothing groups, they showed alright in wings3d, but not anymore in Max :/  Any idea why ?</div>]]></body></post></posts></thread></xml>
