Last year I worked on an ET:QW vehicle mod via scripting. It progressed pretty far, however, it could not continue because the movement of the vehicle was tied to the controls in such a way that the scripting could not handle. The script events would override the ingame physics and cause problems along slanted surfaces. The only answer to this, as far as I can see, is the hard coding of the script's functions(as in purpose), into the game.<br /><br />I know where to look for the vehicles, and am pretty specific about what I need. If you need to know where to look in the source code, I can likely help.<br /><br />What needs to be done isn't terribly complex, and if you hit some kind of stump, it's very likely it can be overcome by looking at code in already in the game, as what we are doing is largely merging two vehicles currently present.<br /><br />If you want to know more information, send me a private message! Thanks!<br /><br />I almost forgot to mention, the artwork for the vehicle is done, and will actually be redone as I have improved my skills. Once this very small project is complete, it could be an interesting facet for your resume or portfolio. Thanks, again.<br /><br /><br /><a href="/web/20110926182619/http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/854/macaskill.jpg/" class="postlink"><img src="/web/20110926182619im_/http://img854.imageshack.us/img854/7388/macaskill.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a></div>]]></body></post><post id="p232329" date="Posted: Thu Aug 04, 2011 1:13 am "><author>Super Happy Cow</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Hello.
