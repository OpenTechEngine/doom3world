Are newer versions of Q3Radiant incompatible with those old .map files created by the version I mentioned above? I just tried to open one map with "Q3Radiant Build 202", and it returned an error about parsing entities with a "{".<br /><br />2. Did the old Q3Radiant by any chance screw up the texture alignments on all the brushes in old maps? Whereas the original PK3s I created were fine, one day a few years later I opened up one of my .map files in another version of Q3R and ALL the textures were misaligned. What happened?<br /><br />Any answers any of you can give would be greatfully appreciated.  <img src="/web/20100702042723im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p225172" date="Posted: Tue Jun 29, 2010 2:57 am "><author>The Happy Friar</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I think I read in a release note somewhere that at one point texture alignment was "fixed".

The non-integer numbers in the middle of each line must be the texture alignments, right? In that case, it would take ages to correct in the later versions of Q3R.<br /><br />Why did this happen? How could they have made such a mistake?<br /><br />But then I may have used a later version of Q3R to compile and THEN it went wrong? Luckily, the .bsps that resulted are fine.<br /><br />Any ideas?</div>]]></body></post></posts></thread></xml>
