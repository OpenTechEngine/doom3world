Original Prey end in open way, one adventure end and other just begin.  Prey is very good game, but unfortunately it is not appreciated and not good know (many people just categorize it as another doom3 clone in dark futuristic corridors without playing in it), full of interesting ideas - combat, puzzle and plot twist. Main hero got his character  (not like in d3 or q4, more like Duke). I was sad, I was in hope there will be at least some good mission pack for this game.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p218454" date="Posted: Wed Sep 09, 2009 7:24 pm "><author>David_020</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225044844/http://www.shacknews.com/laryn.x?story=60360">http://www.shacknews.com/laryn.x?story=60360</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Not sure what this means to Prey 2 but HumanHead had a spike in hiring recently.
