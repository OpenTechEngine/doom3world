I still can't afford to buy a keyboard at $1000, or 900.... I hope its more than slightly less. If not then I'm sticking to my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081119153830/http://www.razerzone.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=2_21&amp;products_id=40" class="postlink">Razer Tarantula</a>. Btw, I think they mentioned Razer in there, but they spelled it Razor =/.<br /><br />I'm not jumping to conclusions on the price, I'm just reacting to what Gizmodo said. And of course they know nothing of what the companies making their keyboards will price them.<br /><br />This is good news still though. I got so gitty at the OLED keyboard product, but I shot myself when I saw the price. Prices going down is always a good thing.<br /><br />But like I said, until it gets down to a reasonable price, I'll just stick to my Tarantula. And I'll probably continue to stick to it until Razer themselves push out an OLED keyboard... I'm a Razer fanboy. (They make awesome products, what can I say...)</div>]]></body></post><post id="p194199" date="Posted: Wed Jan 23, 2008 7:40 am "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I'll wait till they produce a 65 inch version for 1.500 USD to read my favourite website on each key.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p194204" date="Posted: Wed Jan 23, 2008 1:37 pm "><author>The Happy Friar</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">BNA! wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I'll wait till they produce a 65 inch version for 1.500 USD to read my favourite website on each key.</div><br /><br /><br />see, I especially love that because that's $1.50 in USD.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081119153830im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p194226" date="Posted: Thu Jan 24, 2008 8:24 am "><author>stabinbac</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">So, how log until someone gets an led keyboard animated to display porn?

So essentially, you can put whatever you want on there, including GIF animations. I'm sure other companies that develop new OLED keyboards will allow for the same thing, and if they don't then their customers will hack it so they can.</div>]]></body></post></posts></thread></xml>
