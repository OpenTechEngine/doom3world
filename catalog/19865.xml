<br /><br />Nup, haven't tried it.  Given the fact that the stock d3 engine doesn't seem to support above 16k megatextures, or any compression, it seems pointless going through the effort of opening up the beta archives and extracting it out.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p181795" date="Posted: Sat Jun 23, 2007 12:57 pm "><author>Enforcer</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">This wont work in q4 will it?

<br /><br />Why bother with the low resolution masks ingame for stuff like roads when the entire point is that you just have them as part of the megatexture in the first place? <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081120190228im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  As I said I am gradually writing up a tutorial on how to use AO's megagen tool, but if you have a look through the files now you will notice that I actually already used  low resolution images as masks to add things like roads and wall outlines into the megatexture.
<br /><br />In the D3 engine itself, the megatexture layer just acts like a diffuse layer in any other material, so you can add onto it any sort of blends you want.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p182005" date="Posted: Mon Jun 25, 2007 7:31 am "><author>parsonsbear</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">So the low resolution masks would be to hand draw stuff pre-generation to indicate placement without having to work in photoshop at the final resolution?

<br /><br />If I'm reading that correctly, yes.
<br /><br />The megagen tool has three different options.
<br /><br />1) Height based texture distribution
<br /><br />2) Slope based texture distribution
<br /><br />3) Mask based texture distribution
<br /><br />For the mask based distribution I just took a preview image of the megatexture into photoshop, created a new layer, and drew the roads in it in greyscale.  Took out that layer as a 256 colour greyscale image and used it as the basis for a rule.
<br /><br />edit: You can if desired extract out sections of the full scale megatexture to manually add details in photoshop, but I never got around to this apart from a few experimentations.  I chose not to do it for this project because it would then make it impossible for people to recreate the complete megatexture themselves just using the megagen tool.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p182094" date="Posted: Mon Jun 25, 2007 8:47 pm "><author>parsonsbear</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks for the info tron- the extraction process would involve indicating a rectangle in the megatexture, which outputs the local/diffuse for that section at full res, which you can edit in photoshop and send back to the megatexture?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p184905" date="Posted: Tue Jul 31, 2007 7:39 pm "><author>OnlyOneKenobi</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I dowloaded the Megatexture mod and the Megagen zip file from the links that you provided, but when I try to run the ReactorEngine.exe I get an error message <br /><br />"This application has failed to start because d3dx9_30.dll was not found.

<br /><br />Why bother with the low resolution masks ingame for stuff like roads when the entire point is that you just have them as part of the megatexture in the first place? <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081120191155im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  As I said I am gradually writing up a tutorial on how to use AO's megagen tool, but if you have a look through the files now you will notice that I actually already used  low resolution images as masks to add things like roads and wall outlines into the megatexture.

<br /><br />If I'm reading that correctly, yes.
<br /><br />The megagen tool has three different options.
<br /><br />1) Height based texture distribution
<br /><br />2) Slope based texture distribution
<br /><br />3) Mask based texture distribution
<br /><br />For the mask based distribution I just took a preview image of the megatexture into photoshop, created a new layer, and drew the roads in it in greyscale.  Took out that layer as a 256 colour greyscale image and used it as the basis for a rule.
<br /><br />edit: You can if desired extract out sections of the full scale megatexture to manually add details in photoshop, but I never got around to this apart from a few experimentations.  I chose not to do it for this project because it would then make it impossible for people to recreate the complete megatexture themselves just using the megagen tool.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p182094" date="Posted: Mon Jun 25, 2007 8:47 pm "><author>parsonsbear</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks for the info tron- the extraction process would involve indicating a rectangle in the megatexture, which outputs the local/diffuse for that section at full res, which you can edit in photoshop and send back to the megatexture?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p184905" date="Posted: Tue Jul 31, 2007 7:39 pm "><author>OnlyOneKenobi</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I dowloaded the Megatexture mod and the Megagen zip file from the links that you provided, but when I try to run the ReactorEngine.exe I get an error message <br /><br />"This application has failed to start because d3dx9_30.dll was not found.

<br /><br />To save on filesize since Doom3 uses uncompressed Megatextures, the mod is distributed with a 2k*2k megatexture.  Doom3 however supports up to 16k*16k, so you'll have to generate that yourself.

<br /><br />Megagen comes with all the neccesary textures and rules set up to create the full resolution megatexture for the terrain, along with a readme file explaining how to do it.
<br /><br />It's a bit messily put together since it was used as a testbed for various features of the megagen tool as it was developed.  I have been busy lately, but am slowly putting together a tutorial to show how to use it to create you own megatextures based off your own terrain meshes.[/url]</div>]]></body></post><post id="p181736" date="Posted: Fri Jun 22, 2007 8:01 pm "><author>mikebart</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Nice one, Ill be expecting to see some nice etqw maps from you guys, not long now eh</div>]]></body></post><post id="p181741" date="Posted: Fri Jun 22, 2007 8:33 pm "><author>Bo$bevok</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">s w e e t . . .</div>]]></body></post><post id="p181743" date="Posted: Fri Jun 22, 2007 8:54 pm "><author>parsonsbear</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I noticed AO (who originally released this) works for splashdamage now, is that new?

<br /><br />Nup, haven't tried it.
