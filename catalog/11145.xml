<br /><br />As the founder of the project, I have no problems with someone else stepping up and taking over.
<br /><br />I can't see the project continuing forward in it's current state so you all can have at it.
<br /><br />My comment from the news post is quoted below...
<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Just to give credibility to this post, I'm the same rich_is_bored on doom3world.org who started the D3CDIT project to begin with.<br /><br />I've been asked a few times what the status of the project is. As you all know, the project has been in hiatus for several reasons...<br /><br />* The map needs optimized but the current layout does not allow for it.<br />* Several Doom 3 based games have been announced that already prove the point the project was trying to make.<br />* World of Warcraft is apparently a very fun game that has pretty much stolen goliath's attention and since he was running the file server we'd have to work out a new way of collecting assets.<br /><br />Personally, I don't see the project getting back underway unless it's in the form of a completely different map.<br /><br />Why? Well, we all know the answer to that. The map just doesn't run very well in it's current state. I and apparently the rest of the community (remember this was and still is a community project) can't figure out a way to place visportals in the wide open spaces of the square to regain the peak performance of earlier builds.<br /><br />I'm guessing the concept of a city square was just too ambitious a goal.<br /><br />As for me, I've been spending my time spilling my beans on the Doom 3 Wiki so you all have a solid resource for modding the game.<br /><br />You all are more than welcome to pick up where we left off. Feel free to use assets from the current project and if you ever sort out a way to optimize the current map, aside from removing all the interiors of buildings, please, let me know. I'd be very curious to see how you did it.<br /><br />What I suggest is that you start a new map with a euro theme but instead of trying to mimic the mistakes we made with our previous builds you design a layout that caters to optimization.<br /><br />We could never figure out a way to make proper use of vis portals with the current layout. Figure out how to do that with a city style map and you're golden.<br /><br />I also suggest, you visit <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121122450/http://www.doom3world.org/">http://www.doom3world.org</a><!-- m --> and post in the D3CDIT section to let everyone know that you'd like to get the ball rolling on a new iteration of the project.<br /><br />You have my approval. The hardest part is gaining interest.<br /><br />-Rich</div>
<br /><br />I've emailed the individual just to touch base and let him know I am fine with him taking on the task. I've told him to touch base here in the D3CDIT section to get the ball rolling.
