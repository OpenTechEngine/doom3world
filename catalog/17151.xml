<br/><br/>
Does Doom3 treat Heightmaps and Normal Maps differently?&#13;
<br/><br/>
For Example, say you built a simple type of geometry for a normal map test. This geometry would just be a plane, with a few faces extruded outwards towards the camera, making it so all the faces in the model would be either 0 or 90 degree angles. &#13;
<br/><br/>
From what I understand, when rendered out, this test will result in a normal map with just a flat plane, not extra detail, as normal maps only work of of angles and not off of actual height correct? &#13;
<br/><br/>
So to go and ask what I really want to know:&#13;
<br/><br/>
Do heightmaps get converted to normal maps in the level loading process and thus also only work of of angle and not height? Or does it actually store height info?&#13;
<br/><br/><br/>
The reason I ask this is I am wondering if, in order to be able to see "theoretical Z axis information" (fake height off the plane) one could render both a normal map for angle info, and then some sort of height map off a model for height information.&#13;
<br/><br/><br/>
I hope my question makes sense. Sorry if this is such a monotonous question, Its just been bothering me for quite some time now.&#13;

They get converted to a normalmap during the loading of the images.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Since the surface of a plane is never extruded by the bumpmapping process no actual "height" information is ever really relevant unless it is a physical piece of geometry.  This doesn't mean the system is limited but instead means you have to either create the geometry with Radiant or a model editor (excellant idea) and then render a normal from there and apply additional minor surface variations (bumps, low level detail, scratches, gouges, etc.) using the normal map and height map(s).  This means it takes a bit more work but imo you really get a much more superior visual as a result.</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

Yeah I see what you mean, that definatly would yeld the best results, never really thought about doing that with editor patches but it definatly makes sense now that I think of it, especially if Im making the textures for that specific location anyway <img src="/web/20061013024651im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0"/><br/><br/>
What I also meant in asking does it carry any height info is not necessarily a physical, geometric extrusion from the mesh, but rather, some sort of lighting type info. as in a plane that is theoretically closer to the light source(even though the geometry doesnt physically make it so) is slightly brighter than a plane that is theoretically father into the mesh.&#13;
<br/><br/>
I hope that made sense, thanks <img src="/web/20061013024651im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0"/><br/><br/>

I realize that some things just are FAR more practical in a heightmap such as small scratches then actually modeling them... but just to make sure I have one more clarification question:&#13;
<br/><br/>
If one has enough time to model out exactly what they want(say with Zbrush to create even the small scratches) then is it better to only use a complex normal map rather then an additional heightmap to conserve texture memory? Or am I missing another hidden benefit?&#13;
