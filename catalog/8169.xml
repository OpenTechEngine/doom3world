I hope to be able to do my own modeling soon. I am a programmer and have done some team work on a Java Card Game, and did a clone of Tetris in Visual Basic.Net. But I want to do all aspects of game development so I can do a complete game by myself.&#13;<br />With a lot of work I may be able to accomplish this feat.&#13;<br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p71154" date="Posted: Sat Jan 08, 2005 4:19 pm "><author>obsidian</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Some of the best resources for beginners are the ones that come with MAX.
