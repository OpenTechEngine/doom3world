<br /><br />Correct.  Almost any map can include DM gametype support, but we do not wish entries that only support the DM gametype, as part of the reason for creating the pak is to increase the number of maps in the gametypes that need it most (ie, not DM).  If your map is by first nature just a DM map, I suggest that dependent on its size you make it either 1v1 or TDM compatible.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p166724" date="Posted: Sun Jan 07, 2007 4:57 pm "><author>Koroshiya Ichi</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I've made a map for this, but unfortunately due to a number of reasons (mainly performance) I won't be submitting it.
<br /><br />However this is my first ever multiplayer map and if you guys could just give me some feedback on how you feel it looks visually and atmospherically and any advice that'd be greatly greatly appreciated.
<br /><br />The map is ideally made for 1on1 DM, or 3on3 TDM. The inspiration was the sort of 'floating castles' featured in many fantasy novels, integrated with the harsh industrial style of Quake 4 for more of an 'oil rig' theme to it. Unfortuantely due to the rules against custom models the Rock Formations were made completely from splines, greatly harming performance.
<br /><br />As I say though this is my first ever multiplayer map so wasn't expecting too much, if anyone could give advice on how something like this could be enhanced visually though that'd be muchly appreciated! Cheers

<br /><br />Correct.  Almost any map can include DM gametype support, but we do not wish entries that only support the DM gametype, as part of the reason for creating the pak is to increase the number of maps in the gametypes that need it most (ie, not DM).  If your map is by first nature just a DM map, I suggest that dependent on its size you make it either 1v1 or TDM compatible.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p166724" date="Posted: Sun Jan 07, 2007 4:57 pm "><author>Koroshiya Ichi</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I've made a map for this, but unfortunately due to a number of reasons (mainly performance) I won't be submitting it.
<br /><br />However this is my first ever multiplayer map and if you guys could just give me some feedback on how you feel it looks visually and atmospherically and any advice that'd be greatly greatly appreciated.
<br /><br />The map is ideally made for 1on1 DM, or 3on3 TDM. The inspiration was the sort of 'floating castles' featured in many fantasy novels, integrated with the harsh industrial style of Quake 4 for more of an 'oil rig' theme to it. Unfortuantely due to the rules against custom models the Rock Formations were made completely from splines, greatly harming performance.
<br /><br />As I say though this is my first ever multiplayer map so wasn't expecting too much, if anyone could give advice on how something like this could be enhanced visually though that'd be muchly appreciated! Cheers

Quake community mappers have shown amazing talent and innovation and we would like to recognize those talents and challenge them to show us what they can do.
<br /><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Community Map Pak Contest</span>
<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Prizes:</span>
<br /><br />    * Winning participants will have their map included in an official community map pak released by id.
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Basic Rules:</span>
<br /><br />    * Maps must be submitted by their author and be of their own design.
<br />    * Maps may not use custom textures or models.
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><br />How are the maps being judged?</span>
<br /><br />    * Maps will be judged on their playability, performance, atmosphere, originality, technical quality, gametype flexibility and file size efficiency.
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">How many maps will be included?</span>
<br /><br />    * 8-12 maps will be selected, spanning multiple gametypes.
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What gametypes does the Q4CMP seek to include?</span>
<br /><br />    * We are accepting submissions that include support for any of the following gametypes: 1v1, Team Deathmatch, CTF, Arena CTF and DeadZone.
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">I understand custom textures cannot be used, but what about custom materials and fx files?</span>
<br /><br />    * You may include custom script files such as fx and material files, but you may not include or reference custom textures, models or sound files.
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">How many entries am I allowed to submit?</span>

<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Who will be judging the submissions?</span>
<br /><br />    * You! As the deadline draws near be on the lookout for an offiicial polling station near you.
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Where do you send the maps?</span>
<br /><br />    * Map submissions should be emailed to: <!-- e --><a href="mailto:syncerror@idsoftware.com">syncerror@idsoftware.com</a><!-- e -->

<br /><br />Well, for starters, they designed the game, so they'd be pretty on-top of what is or isn't custom.
<br /><br />The idea behind not using custom textures is to keep the filesize down.

<br /><br />- The "edit version" where everything is getting thrown into

<br /><br />On windows I recommend using NTFS' junction points.  I have a dev tree, a vanilla tree, and a tree dedicated to my team's subversion repository, all on my data drive.  But Windows thinks I have just one install on my programs drive.  This is done by using linkd to junction C:\Program Files\Doom 3 to the specific install of the game I want to use.  This flexible setup will help windows and doom both forgive each other's differences when it comes to handling the filesystem.
<br /><br />It's a little complicated, but if you're juggling multiple trees it can really help.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p166292" date="Posted: Wed Jan 03, 2007 12:58 am "><author>bolleh</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">kat wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I'd reckon that's a no as well, you can imagine what that would be like to check... they'd have to looks at the syntax of each material to make sure it was actually correct and not a half arsed hack (like I'd do!) so as not to cause any rendering or general material system errors!.

<br />well, its actually kinda simple <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081119153310im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />just check the sent in pk4 for any image files(which im sure they will allready do). off course ignore/replace the levelshot image. since you just use ingame textures to comply with you shader you merely use the game's base resources. or maybe just take an existing q4 shader and adjust it slightly like taking one of the texture layers out or simply change a certain blend effect
<br /><br />i know im kinda nagging with these questions, its just that its fun to take something limited and pulling something new off and see others do the same, not just geometry wise but also inventiveness.
<br /><br />if you cant break a limitation, you'd have to go around it id say <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081119153310im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p166299" date="Posted: Wed Jan 03, 2007 1:38 am "><author>kat</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">It's not the assets that's the problem but the correct material syntax... they'd need to make sure that all the materials are technically correct for all render modes (vp and none vp).</div>]]></body></post><post id="p166453" date="Posted: Thu Jan 04, 2007 10:59 am "><author>Lukin</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">If so they should announce that.

<br /><br />"Submissions for our Quake 4 Community Map Pak have begun rolling in and with the January 31st deadline slowly approaching we would like to address the questions that have been brought up with the announcement of the Q4CMP Contest.
<br /><br />What gametypes does the Q4CMP seek to include?
<br /><br />    * We are accepting submissions that include support for any of the following gametypes: 1v1, Team Deathmatch, CTF, Arena CTF and DeadZone.
<br /><br />I understand custom textures cannot be used, but what about custom materials and fx files?
<br /><br />    * You may include custom script files such as fx and material files, but you may not include or reference custom textures, models or sound files.
<br /><br />How many entries am I allowed to submit?
<br /><br />    * Submit as many as you like! We are accepting both existing community maps that have already been released as well as new creations.
<br /><br />What format should I submit the map?
<br /><br />    * We prefer that maps be properly packaged with their .map, .proc, .cm, .def and loadscreen screenshot files, however can accept just the .map. The maps will be repackaged for both the voting process and final Community Pak.
<br /><br />Who will be judging the submissions?
<br /><br />    * You! As the deadline draws near be on the lookout for an offiicial polling station near you.
<br /><br />Where can I find community resources and tutorials on Quake 4 map making?
<br /><br />    * idDevNet
<br />    * Doom3World.org
<br />    * modwiki.net
<br />    * Quake3World.com
<br />    * Rust GameDesign
<br /><br />Please feel free to submit all questions, inquiries or submissions to SyncError.

<br /><br />Correct.  Almost any map can include DM gametype support, but we do not wish entries that only support the DM gametype, as part of the reason for creating the pak is to increase the number of maps in the gametypes that need it most (ie, not DM).  If your map is by first nature just a DM map, I suggest that dependent on its size you make it either 1v1 or TDM compatible.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p166724" date="Posted: Sun Jan 07, 2007 4:57 pm "><author>Koroshiya Ichi</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I've made a map for this, but unfortunately due to a number of reasons (mainly performance) I won't be submitting it.

<br /><br />The map is ideally made for 1on1 DM, or 3on3 TDM.

<br /><br />On windows I recommend using NTFS' junction points.  I have a dev tree, a vanilla tree, and a tree dedicated to my team's subversion repository, all on my data drive.  But Windows thinks I have just one install on my programs drive.  This is done by using linkd to junction C:\Program Files\Doom 3 to the specific install of the game I want to use.  This flexible setup will help windows and doom both forgive each other's differences when it comes to handling the filesystem.
<br /><br />It's a little complicated, but if you're juggling multiple trees it can really help.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p166292" date="Posted: Wed Jan 03, 2007 12:58 am "><author>bolleh</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">kat wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I'd reckon that's a no as well, you can imagine what that would be like to check... they'd have to looks at the syntax of each material to make sure it was actually correct and not a half arsed hack (like I'd do!) so as not to cause any rendering or general material system errors!.

<br />well, its actually kinda simple <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081119153310im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />just check the sent in pk4 for any image files(which im sure they will allready do). off course ignore/replace the levelshot image. since you just use ingame textures to comply with you shader you merely use the game's base resources. or maybe just take an existing q4 shader and adjust it slightly like taking one of the texture layers out or simply change a certain blend effect
<br /><br />i know im kinda nagging with these questions, its just that its fun to take something limited and pulling something new off and see others do the same, not just geometry wise but also inventiveness.

<br /><br />Correct.  Almost any map can include DM gametype support, but we do not wish entries that only support the DM gametype, as part of the reason for creating the pak is to increase the number of maps in the gametypes that need it most (ie, not DM).  If your map is by first nature just a DM map, I suggest that dependent on its size you make it either 1v1 or TDM compatible.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p166724" date="Posted: Sun Jan 07, 2007 4:57 pm "><author>Koroshiya Ichi</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I've made a map for this, but unfortunately due to a number of reasons (mainly performance) I won't be submitting it.
<br /><br />However this is my first ever multiplayer map and if you guys could just give me some feedback on how you feel it looks visually and atmospherically and any advice that'd be greatly greatly appreciated.
<br /><br />The map is ideally made for 1on1 DM, or 3on3 TDM. The inspiration was the sort of 'floating castles' featured in many fantasy novels, integrated with the harsh industrial style of Quake 4 for more of an 'oil rig' theme to it. Unfortuantely due to the rules against custom models the Rock Formations were made completely from splines, greatly harming performance.
<br /><br />As I say though this is my first ever multiplayer map so wasn't expecting too much, if anyone could give advice on how something like this could be enhanced visually though that'd be muchly appreciated! Cheers

The other thing is the angled floating jumpads. Add detail and make them look like useful bases for the jumpads instead of triangles.
<br /><br />My favorite part of this map, I think, are the loading vehicles docked to receive the freight tanks. That is a great touch <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225043001im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />[edit] You should probably post this in the WIP section instead of here.

<br /><br />Correct.  Almost any map can include DM gametype support, but we do not wish entries that only support the DM gametype, as part of the reason for creating the pak is to increase the number of maps in the gametypes that need it most (ie, not DM).  If your map is by first nature just a DM map, I suggest that dependent on its size you make it either 1v1 or TDM compatible.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p166724" date="Posted: Sun Jan 07, 2007 4:57 pm "><author>Koroshiya Ichi</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I've made a map for this, but unfortunately due to a number of reasons (mainly performance) I won't be submitting it.
<br /><br />However this is my first ever multiplayer map and if you guys could just give me some feedback on how you feel it looks visually and atmospherically and any advice that'd be greatly greatly appreciated.
<br /><br />The map is ideally made for 1on1 DM, or 3on3 TDM. The inspiration was the sort of 'floating castles' featured in many fantasy novels, integrated with the harsh industrial style of Quake 4 for more of an 'oil rig' theme to it. Unfortuantely due to the rules against custom models the Rock Formations were made completely from splines, greatly harming performance.
<br /><br />As I say though this is my first ever multiplayer map so wasn't expecting too much, if anyone could give advice on how something like this could be enhanced visually though that'd be muchly appreciated! Cheers

Quake community mappers have shown amazing talent and innovation and we would like to recognize those talents and challenge them to show us what they can do.
<br /><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Community Map Pak Contest</span>
<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Prizes:</span>
<br /><br />    * Winning participants will have their map included in an official community map pak released by id.
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Basic Rules:</span>
<br /><br />    * Maps must be submitted by their author and be of their own design.
<br />    * Maps may not use custom textures or models.
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><br />How are the maps being judged?</span>
<br /><br />    * Maps will be judged on their playability, performance, atmosphere, originality, technical quality, gametype flexibility and file size efficiency.
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">How many maps will be included?</span>
<br /><br />    * 8-12 maps will be selected, spanning multiple gametypes.
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What gametypes does the Q4CMP seek to include?</span>
<br /><br />    * We are accepting submissions that include support for any of the following gametypes: 1v1, Team Deathmatch, CTF, Arena CTF and DeadZone.
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">I understand custom textures cannot be used, but what about custom materials and fx files?</span>
<br /><br />    * You may include custom script files such as fx and material files, but you may not include or reference custom textures, models or sound files.
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">How many entries am I allowed to submit?</span>
<br /><br />    * Submit as many as you like! We are accepting both existing community maps that have already been released as well as new creations.
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What format should I submit the map?</span>
<br /><br />    * We prefer that maps be properly packaged with their .map, .proc, .cm, .def and loadscreen screenshot files, however can accept just the .map. The maps will be repackaged for both the voting process and final Community Pak.
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Who will be judging the submissions?</span>
<br /><br />    * You! As the deadline draws near be on the lookout for an offiicial polling station near you.
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Where do you send the maps?</span>
<br /><br />    * Map submissions should be emailed to: <!-- e --><a href="mailto:syncerror@idsoftware.com">syncerror@idsoftware.com</a><!-- e -->
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Deadlines:</span>
<br /><br />    * The deadline for entries is January 31st.

<br/><br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Prizes:</span>&#13;
<br/><br/>
    * Winning participants will have their map included in an official community map pak released by id.&#13;
<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Basic Rules:</span>&#13;
<br/><br/>
    * Maps must be submitted by their author and be of their own design.&#13;
<br/>
    * Maps may not use custom textures or models.&#13;
<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">&#13;
<br/>
How are the maps being judged?</span>&#13;
<br/><br/>
    * Maps will be judged on their playability, performance, atmosphere, originality, technical quality, gametype flexibility and file size efficiency.&#13;
<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">How many maps will be included?</span>&#13;
<br/><br/>
    * 8-12 maps will be selected, spanning multiple gametypes.&#13;
<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">What gametypes does the Q4CMP seek to include?</span>&#13;
<br/><br/>
    * We are accepting submissions that include support for any of the following gametypes: 1v1, Team Deathmatch, CTF, Arena CTF and DeadZone.&#13;
<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">I understand custom textures cannot be used, but what about custom materials and fx files?</span>&#13;
<br/><br/>

<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Who will be judging the submissions?</span>&#13;
<br/><br/>
    * You! As the deadline draws near be on the lookout for an offiicial polling station near you.&#13;
<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Where do you send the maps?</span>&#13;
<br/><br/>
    * Map submissions should be emailed to: <a href="mailto:syncerror@idsoftware.com">syncerror@idsoftware.com</a>&#13;

<br /><br />Well, for starters, they designed the game, so they'd be pretty on-top of what is or isn't custom.
<br /><br />The idea behind not using custom textures is to keep the filesize down.

Quake community mappers have shown amazing talent and innovation and we would like to recognize those talents and challenge them to show us what they can do.&#13;
<br/><br/><br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Community Map Pak Contest</span>&#13;
<br/><br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Prizes:</span>&#13;
<br/><br/>
    * Winning participants will have their map included in an official community map pak released by id.&#13;
<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Basic Rules:</span>&#13;
<br/><br/>
    * Maps must be submitted by their author and be of their own design.&#13;
<br/>
    * Maps may not use custom textures or models.&#13;
<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">&#13;
<br/>
How are the maps being judged?</span>&#13;
<br/><br/>
    * Maps will be judged on their playability, performance, atmosphere, originality, technical quality, gametype flexibility and file size efficiency.&#13;
<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">How many maps will be included?</span>&#13;
<br/><br/>
    * 8-12 maps will be selected, spanning multiple gametypes.&#13;
<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">What gametypes does the Q4CMP seek to include?</span>&#13;
<br/><br/>
    * We are accepting submissions that include support for any of the following gametypes: 1v1, Team Deathmatch, CTF, Arena CTF and DeadZone.&#13;
<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">I understand custom textures cannot be used, but what about custom materials and fx files?</span>&#13;
<br/><br/>
    * You may include custom script files such as fx and material files, but you may not include or reference custom textures, models or sound files.&#13;
<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">How many entries am I allowed to submit?</span>&#13;
<br/><br/>
    * Submit as many as you like! We are accepting both existing community maps that have already been released as well as new creations.&#13;
<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">What format should I submit the map?</span>&#13;
<br/><br/>
    * We prefer that maps be properly packaged with their .map, .proc, .cm, .def and loadscreen screenshot files, however can accept just the .map. The maps will be repackaged for both the voting process and final Community Pak.&#13;
<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Who will be judging the submissions?</span>&#13;
<br/><br/>
    * You! As the deadline draws near be on the lookout for an offiicial polling station near you.&#13;
<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Where do you send the maps?</span>&#13;
<br/><br/>
    * Map submissions should be emailed to: <a href="mailto:syncerror@idsoftware.com">syncerror@idsoftware.com</a>&#13;
<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Deadlines:</span>&#13;
<br/><br/>
    * The deadline for entries is January 31st.&#13;

i havent mapped since june or so when my pc crashed and i lost all my data/partitions including all my maps and textures.&#13;

is there a prize or something for the "best" map in the pack? might be a nice drive for alot of mappers, a simple item signed by the id software team or something <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0"/><br/><br/>
a doom/quake shirt signed by J. Carmack, A. Carmack, J. Romero and T. Hall...thats gotta be a dream prize for most i think <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0"/><br/><br/><br/>

trick question for syncerror:&#13;
<br/><br/>
no custom textures allowed, obviously mappers will supply a levelshot with their levels. is it allowed to use that levelshot as a texture in the level?&#13;

technically not really a texture but more of a cheeky workaround <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0"/></span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

<br/><br/><br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Community Map Pak Contest</span>&#13;
<br/><br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Prizes:</span>&#13;
<br/><br/>
    * Winning participants will have their map included in an official community map pak released by id.&#13;
<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Basic Rules:</span>&#13;
<br/><br/>
    * Maps must be submitted by their author and be of their own design.&#13;
<br/>
    * Maps may not use custom textures or models.&#13;
<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">&#13;
<br/>
How are the maps being judged?</span>&#13;
<br/><br/>
    * Maps will be judged on their playability, performance, atmosphere, originality, technical quality, gametype flexibility and file size efficiency.&#13;
<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">How many maps will be included?</span>&#13;
<br/><br/>
    * 8-12 maps will be selected, spanning multiple gametypes.&#13;
<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">What gametypes does the Q4CMP seek to include?</span>&#13;
<br/><br/>
    * We are accepting submissions that include support for any of the following gametypes: 1v1, Team Deathmatch, CTF, Arena CTF and DeadZone.&#13;
<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">I understand custom textures cannot be used, but what about custom materials and fx files?</span>&#13;
<br/><br/>
    * You may include custom script files such as fx and material files, but you may not include or reference custom textures, models or sound files.&#13;
<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">How many entries am I allowed to submit?</span>&#13;
<br/><br/>
    * Submit as many as you like! We are accepting both existing community maps that have already been released as well as new creations.&#13;
<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">What format should I submit the map?</span>&#13;
<br/><br/>
    * We prefer that maps be properly packaged with their .map, .proc, .cm, .def and loadscreen screenshot files, however can accept just the .map. The maps will be repackaged for both the voting process and final Community Pak.&#13;
<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Who will be judging the submissions?</span>&#13;
<br/><br/>
    * You! As the deadline draws near be on the lookout for an offiicial polling station near you.&#13;
<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Where do you send the maps?</span>&#13;
<br/><br/>
    * Map submissions should be emailed to: <a href="mailto:syncerror@idsoftware.com">syncerror@idsoftware.com</a>&#13;
<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Deadlines:</span>&#13;
<br/><br/>
    * The deadline for entries is January 31st.&#13;

i havent mapped since june or so when my pc crashed and i lost all my data/partitions including all my maps and textures.&#13;
<br/><br/>
is there a prize or something for the "best" map in the pack? might be a nice drive for alot of mappers, a simple item signed by the id software team or something <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0"/><br/><br/>
a doom/quake shirt signed by J. Carmack, A. Carmack, J. Romero and T. Hall...thats gotta be a dream prize for most i think <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0"/><br/><br/><br/>
&lt;edit&gt;&#13;
<br/>
trick question for syncerror:&#13;
<br/><br/>
no custom textures allowed, obviously mappers will supply a levelshot with their levels. is it allowed to use that levelshot as a texture in the level?&#13;
<br/><br/>
technically not really a texture but more of a cheeky workaround <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0"/></span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

<br /><br />Well, for starters, they designed the game, so they'd be pretty on-top of what is or isn't custom.
<br /><br />The idea behind not using custom textures is to keep the filesize down.

<br /><br />Any good mapper has at least 2 installs for the game he's mapping for:
<br /><br />- The "edit version" where everything is getting thrown into

<br /><br />On windows I recommend using NTFS' junction points.  I have a dev tree, a vanilla tree, and a tree dedicated to my team's subversion repository, all on my data drive.  But Windows thinks I have just one install on my programs drive.  This is done by using linkd to junction C:\Program Files\Doom 3 to the specific install of the game I want to use.  This flexible setup will help windows and doom both forgive each other's differences when it comes to handling the filesystem.
<br /><br />It's a little complicated, but if you're juggling multiple trees it can really help.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p166292" date="Posted: Wed Jan 03, 2007 12:58 am "><author>bolleh</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">kat wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I'd reckon that's a no as well, you can imagine what that would be like to check... they'd have to looks at the syntax of each material to make sure it was actually correct and not a half arsed hack (like I'd do!) so as not to cause any rendering or general material system errors!.

<br />well, its actually kinda simple <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />just check the sent in pk4 for any image files(which im sure they will allready do). off course ignore/replace the levelshot image. since you just use ingame textures to comply with you shader you merely use the game's base resources. or maybe just take an existing q4 shader and adjust it slightly like taking one of the texture layers out or simply change a certain blend effect
<br /><br />i know im kinda nagging with these questions, its just that its fun to take something limited and pulling something new off and see others do the same, not just geometry wise but also inventiveness.
<br /><br />if you cant break a limitation, you'd have to go around it id say <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p166299" date="Posted: Wed Jan 03, 2007 1:38 am "><author>kat</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">It's not the assets that's the problem but the correct material syntax... they'd need to make sure that all the materials are technically correct for all render modes (vp and none vp).</div>]]></body></post><post id="p166453" date="Posted: Thu Jan 04, 2007 10:59 am "><author>Lukin</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">If so they should announce that.

<br /><br />"Submissions for our Quake 4 Community Map Pak have begun rolling in and with the January 31st deadline slowly approaching we would like to address the questions that have been brought up with the announcement of the Q4CMP Contest.
<br /><br />What gametypes does the Q4CMP seek to include?
<br /><br />    * We are accepting submissions that include support for any of the following gametypes: 1v1, Team Deathmatch, CTF, Arena CTF and DeadZone.
<br /><br />I understand custom textures cannot be used, but what about custom materials and fx files?
<br /><br />    * You may include custom script files such as fx and material files, but you may not include or reference custom textures, models or sound files.
<br /><br />How many entries am I allowed to submit?
<br /><br />    * Submit as many as you like! We are accepting both existing community maps that have already been released as well as new creations.
<br /><br />What format should I submit the map?
<br /><br />    * We prefer that maps be properly packaged with their .map, .proc, .cm, .def and loadscreen screenshot files, however can accept just the .map. The maps will be repackaged for both the voting process and final Community Pak.
<br /><br />Who will be judging the submissions?
<br /><br />    * You! As the deadline draws near be on the lookout for an offiicial polling station near you.
<br /><br />Where can I find community resources and tutorials on Quake 4 map making?
<br /><br />    * idDevNet
<br />    * Doom3World.org
<br />    * modwiki.net
<br />    * Quake3World.com
<br />    * Rust GameDesign
<br /><br />Please feel free to submit all questions, inquiries or submissions to SyncError.

<br /><br />On windows I recommend using NTFS' junction points.  I have a dev tree, a vanilla tree, and a tree dedicated to my team's subversion repository, all on my data drive.  But Windows thinks I have just one install on my programs drive.  This is done by using linkd to junction C:\Program Files\Doom 3 to the specific install of the game I want to use.  This flexible setup will help windows and doom both forgive each other's differences when it comes to handling the filesystem.

<br />well, its actually kinda simple <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />just check the sent in pk4 for any image files(which im sure they will allready do). off course ignore/replace the levelshot image. since you just use ingame textures to comply with you shader you merely use the game's base resources. or maybe just take an existing q4 shader and adjust it slightly like taking one of the texture layers out or simply change a certain blend effect
<br /><br />i know im kinda nagging with these questions, its just that its fun to take something limited and pulling something new off and see others do the same, not just geometry wise but also inventiveness.
<br /><br />if you cant break a limitation, you'd have to go around it id say <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>

						<div class="postbody">I thought I'd share the new contest details from id's site:
<br /><br />"Submissions for our Quake 4 Community Map Pak have begun rolling in and with the January 31st deadline slowly approaching we would like to address the questions that have been brought up with the announcement of the Q4CMP Contest.
<br /><br />What gametypes does the Q4CMP seek to include?
<br /><br />    * We are accepting submissions that include support for any of the following gametypes: 1v1, Team Deathmatch, CTF, Arena CTF and DeadZone.
<br /><br />I understand custom textures cannot be used, but what about custom materials and fx files?
<br /><br />    * You may include custom script files such as fx and material files, but you may not include or reference custom textures, models or sound files.
<br /><br />How many entries am I allowed to submit?
<br /><br />    * Submit as many as you like! We are accepting both existing community maps that have already been released as well as new creations.
<br /><br />What format should I submit the map?
<br /><br />    * We prefer that maps be properly packaged with their .map, .proc, .cm, .def and loadscreen screenshot files, however can accept just the .map. The maps will be repackaged for both the voting process and final Community Pak.
<br /><br />Who will be judging the submissions?
<br /><br />    * You! As the deadline draws near be on the lookout for an offiicial polling station near you.
<br /><br />Where can I find community resources and tutorials on Quake 4 map making?
<br /><br />    * idDevNet
<br />    * Doom3World.org
<br />    * modwiki.net
<br />    * Quake3World.com
<br />    * Rust GameDesign
<br /><br />Please feel free to submit all questions, inquiries or submissions to SyncError. "</div>

<br /><br />Any good mapper has at least 2 installs for the game he's mapping for:
<br /><br />- The "edit version" where everything is getting thrown into
<br />- The "clean edit version" which is nothing more than a 100% vanilla install to check for missing files in your otherwise produced map and for 100% sure stock asset mapping.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p165977" date="Posted: Sat Dec 30, 2006 8:12 am "><author>heXum</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Quaker-X's question is still valid, though.

<br /><br />On windows I recommend using NTFS' junction points.  I have a dev tree, a vanilla tree, and a tree dedicated to my team's subversion repository, all on my data drive.  But Windows thinks I have just one install on my programs drive.  This is done by using linkd to junction C:\Program Files\Doom 3 to the specific install of the game I want to use.  This flexible setup will help windows and doom both forgive each other's differences when it comes to handling the filesystem.
<br /><br />It's a little complicated, but if you're juggling multiple trees it can really help.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p166292" date="Posted: Wed Jan 03, 2007 12:58 am "><author>bolleh</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">kat wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I'd reckon that's a no as well, you can imagine what that would be like to check... they'd have to looks at the syntax of each material to make sure it was actually correct and not a half arsed hack (like I'd do!) so as not to cause any rendering or general material system errors!.

<br />well, its actually kinda simple <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />just check the sent in pk4 for any image files(which im sure they will allready do). off course ignore/replace the levelshot image. since you just use ingame textures to comply with you shader you merely use the game's base resources. or maybe just take an existing q4 shader and adjust it slightly like taking one of the texture layers out or simply change a certain blend effect
<br /><br />i know im kinda nagging with these questions, its just that its fun to take something limited and pulling something new off and see others do the same, not just geometry wise but also inventiveness.
<br /><br />if you cant break a limitation, you'd have to go around it id say <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p166299" date="Posted: Wed Jan 03, 2007 1:38 am "><author>kat</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">It's not the assets that's the problem but the correct material syntax... they'd need to make sure that all the materials are technically correct for all render modes (vp and none vp).</div>]]></body></post><post id="p166453" date="Posted: Thu Jan 04, 2007 10:59 am "><author>Lukin</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">If so they should announce that.

<br /><br />"Submissions for our Quake 4 Community Map Pak have begun rolling in and with the January 31st deadline slowly approaching we would like to address the questions that have been brought up with the announcement of the Q4CMP Contest.
<br /><br />What gametypes does the Q4CMP seek to include?
<br /><br />    * We are accepting submissions that include support for any of the following gametypes: 1v1, Team Deathmatch, CTF, Arena CTF and DeadZone.
<br /><br />I understand custom textures cannot be used, but what about custom materials and fx files?
<br /><br />    * You may include custom script files such as fx and material files, but you may not include or reference custom textures, models or sound files.
<br /><br />How many entries am I allowed to submit?
<br /><br />    * Submit as many as you like! We are accepting both existing community maps that have already been released as well as new creations.
<br /><br />What format should I submit the map?
<br /><br />    * We prefer that maps be properly packaged with their .map, .proc, .cm, .def and loadscreen screenshot files, however can accept just the .map. The maps will be repackaged for both the voting process and final Community Pak.
<br /><br />Who will be judging the submissions?
<br /><br />    * You! As the deadline draws near be on the lookout for an offiicial polling station near you.
<br /><br />Where can I find community resources and tutorials on Quake 4 map making?
<br /><br />    * idDevNet
<br />    * Doom3World.org
<br />    * modwiki.net
<br />    * Quake3World.com
<br />    * Rust GameDesign
<br /><br />Please feel free to submit all questions, inquiries or submissions to SyncError.

<br /><br />On windows I recommend using NTFS' junction points.  I have a dev tree, a vanilla tree, and a tree dedicated to my team's subversion repository, all on my data drive.  But Windows thinks I have just one install on my programs drive.  This is done by using linkd to junction C:\Program Files\Doom 3 to the specific install of the game I want to use.  This flexible setup will help windows and doom both forgive each other's differences when it comes to handling the filesystem.
<br /><br />It's a little complicated, but if you're juggling multiple trees it can really help.</div>

						<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">kat wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I'd reckon that's a no as well, you can imagine what that would be like to check... they'd have to looks at the syntax of each material to make sure it was actually correct and not a half arsed hack (like I'd do!) so as not to cause any rendering or general material system errors!. Quite a bit of work I would have thought  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /></div>
<br />well, its actually kinda simple <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />just check the sent in pk4 for any image files(which im sure they will allready do). off course ignore/replace the levelshot image. since you just use ingame textures to comply with you shader you merely use the game's base resources. or maybe just take an existing q4 shader and adjust it slightly like taking one of the texture layers out or simply change a certain blend effect
<br /><br />i know im kinda nagging with these questions, its just that its fun to take something limited and pulling something new off and see others do the same, not just geometry wise but also inventiveness.
<br /><br />if you cant break a limitation, you'd have to go around it id say <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>

						<div class="postbody">I thought I'd share the new contest details from id's site:
<br /><br />"Submissions for our Quake 4 Community Map Pak have begun rolling in and with the January 31st deadline slowly approaching we would like to address the questions that have been brought up with the announcement of the Q4CMP Contest.
<br /><br />What gametypes does the Q4CMP seek to include?
<br /><br />    * We are accepting submissions that include support for any of the following gametypes: 1v1, Team Deathmatch, CTF, Arena CTF and DeadZone.
<br /><br />I understand custom textures cannot be used, but what about custom materials and fx files?
<br /><br />    * You may include custom script files such as fx and material files, but you may not include or reference custom textures, models or sound files.
<br /><br />How many entries am I allowed to submit?
<br /><br />    * Submit as many as you like! We are accepting both existing community maps that have already been released as well as new creations.
<br /><br />What format should I submit the map?
<br /><br />    * We prefer that maps be properly packaged with their .map, .proc, .cm, .def and loadscreen screenshot files, however can accept just the .map. The maps will be repackaged for both the voting process and final Community Pak.
<br /><br />Who will be judging the submissions?
<br /><br />    * You! As the deadline draws near be on the lookout for an offiicial polling station near you.
<br /><br />Where can I find community resources and tutorials on Quake 4 map making?
<br /><br />    * idDevNet
<br />    * Doom3World.org
<br />    * modwiki.net
<br />    * Quake3World.com
<br />    * Rust GameDesign

<br /><br />On windows I recommend using NTFS' junction points.  I have a dev tree, a vanilla tree, and a tree dedicated to my team's subversion repository, all on my data drive.  But Windows thinks I have just one install on my programs drive.  This is done by using linkd to junction C:\Program Files\Doom 3 to the specific install of the game I want to use.  This flexible setup will help windows and doom both forgive each other's differences when it comes to handling the filesystem.

<br />well, its actually kinda simple <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />just check the sent in pk4 for any image files(which im sure they will allready do). off course ignore/replace the levelshot image. since you just use ingame textures to comply with you shader you merely use the game's base resources. or maybe just take an existing q4 shader and adjust it slightly like taking one of the texture layers out or simply change a certain blend effect
<br /><br />i know im kinda nagging with these questions, its just that its fun to take something limited and pulling something new off and see others do the same, not just geometry wise but also inventiveness.
<br /><br />if you cant break a limitation, you'd have to go around it id say <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p166299" date="Posted: Wed Jan 03, 2007 1:38 am "><author>kat</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">It's not the assets that's the problem but the correct material syntax... they'd need to make sure that all the materials are technically correct for all render modes (vp and none vp).</div>]]></body></post><post id="p166453" date="Posted: Thu Jan 04, 2007 10:59 am "><author>Lukin</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">If so they should announce that.

<br /><br />"Submissions for our Quake 4 Community Map Pak have begun rolling in and with the January 31st deadline slowly approaching we would like to address the questions that have been brought up with the announcement of the Q4CMP Contest.
<br /><br />What gametypes does the Q4CMP seek to include?
<br /><br />    * We are accepting submissions that include support for any of the following gametypes: 1v1, Team Deathmatch, CTF, Arena CTF and DeadZone.
<br /><br />I understand custom textures cannot be used, but what about custom materials and fx files?
<br /><br />    * You may include custom script files such as fx and material files, but you may not include or reference custom textures, models or sound files.
<br /><br />How many entries am I allowed to submit?
<br /><br />    * Submit as many as you like! We are accepting both existing community maps that have already been released as well as new creations.
<br /><br />What format should I submit the map?
<br /><br />    * We prefer that maps be properly packaged with their .map, .proc, .cm, .def and loadscreen screenshot files, however can accept just the .map. The maps will be repackaged for both the voting process and final Community Pak.
<br /><br />Who will be judging the submissions?
<br /><br />    * You! As the deadline draws near be on the lookout for an offiicial polling station near you.
<br /><br />Where can I find community resources and tutorials on Quake 4 map making?
<br /><br />    * idDevNet
<br />    * Doom3World.org
<br />    * modwiki.net
<br />    * Quake3World.com
<br />    * Rust GameDesign
<br /><br />Please feel free to submit all questions, inquiries or submissions to SyncError.

But Windows thinks I have just one install on my programs drive.  This is done by using linkd to junction C:\Program Files\Doom 3 to the specific install of the game I want to use.  This flexible setup will help windows and doom both forgive each other's differences when it comes to handling the filesystem.

						<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">kat wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I'd reckon that's a no as well, you can imagine what that would be like to check... they'd have to looks at the syntax of each material to make sure it was actually correct and not a half arsed hack (like I'd do!) so as not to cause any rendering or general material system errors!. Quite a bit of work I would have thought  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /></div>
<br />well, its actually kinda simple <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />just check the sent in pk4 for any image files(which im sure they will allready do). off course ignore/replace the levelshot image. since you just use ingame textures to comply with you shader you merely use the game's base resources. or maybe just take an existing q4 shader and adjust it slightly like taking one of the texture layers out or simply change a certain blend effect
<br /><br />i know im kinda nagging with these questions, its just that its fun to take something limited and pulling something new off and see others do the same, not just geometry wise but also inventiveness.
<br /><br />if you cant break a limitation, you'd have to go around it id say <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>

<br /><br />"Submissions for our Quake 4 Community Map Pak have begun rolling in and with the January 31st deadline slowly approaching we would like to address the questions that have been brought up with the announcement of the Q4CMP Contest.
<br /><br />What gametypes does the Q4CMP seek to include?
<br /><br />    * We are accepting submissions that include support for any of the following gametypes: 1v1, Team Deathmatch, CTF, Arena CTF and DeadZone.
<br /><br />I understand custom textures cannot be used, but what about custom materials and fx files?
<br /><br />    * You may include custom script files such as fx and material files, but you may not include or reference custom textures, models or sound files.
<br /><br />How many entries am I allowed to submit?
<br /><br />    * Submit as many as you like! We are accepting both existing community maps that have already been released as well as new creations.
<br /><br />What format should I submit the map?
<br /><br />    * We prefer that maps be properly packaged with their .map, .proc, .cm, .def and loadscreen screenshot files, however can accept just the .map. The maps will be repackaged for both the voting process and final Community Pak.
<br /><br />Who will be judging the submissions?
<br /><br />    * You! As the deadline draws near be on the lookout for an offiicial polling station near you.
<br /><br />Where can I find community resources and tutorials on Quake 4 map making?
<br /><br />    * idDevNet
<br />    * Doom3World.org
<br />    * modwiki.net
<br />    * Quake3World.com
<br />    * Rust GameDesign
<br /><br />Please feel free to submit all questions, inquiries or submissions to SyncError. "</div>

<br /><br />On windows I recommend using NTFS' junction points.  I have a dev tree, a vanilla tree, and a tree dedicated to my team's subversion repository, all on my data drive.  But Windows thinks I have just one install on my programs drive.  This is done by using linkd to junction C:\Program Files\Doom 3 to the specific install of the game I want to use.  This flexible setup will help windows and doom both forgive each other's differences when it comes to handling the filesystem.
<br /><br />It's a little complicated, but if you're juggling multiple trees it can really help.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p166292" date="Posted: Wed Jan 03, 2007 12:58 am "><author>bolleh</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">kat wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I'd reckon that's a no as well, you can imagine what that would be like to check... they'd have to looks at the syntax of each material to make sure it was actually correct and not a half arsed hack (like I'd do!) so as not to cause any rendering or general material system errors!.

<br />well, its actually kinda simple <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />just check the sent in pk4 for any image files(which im sure they will allready do). off course ignore/replace the levelshot image. since you just use ingame textures to comply with you shader you merely use the game's base resources. or maybe just take an existing q4 shader and adjust it slightly like taking one of the texture layers out or simply change a certain blend effect
<br /><br />i know im kinda nagging with these questions, its just that its fun to take something limited and pulling something new off and see others do the same, not just geometry wise but also inventiveness.
<br /><br />if you cant break a limitation, you'd have to go around it id say <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p166299" date="Posted: Wed Jan 03, 2007 1:38 am "><author>kat</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">It's not the assets that's the problem but the correct material syntax... they'd need to make sure that all the materials are technically correct for all render modes (vp and none vp).</div>]]></body></post><post id="p166453" date="Posted: Thu Jan 04, 2007 10:59 am "><author>Lukin</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">If so they should announce that.

<br /><br />"Submissions for our Quake 4 Community Map Pak have begun rolling in and with the January 31st deadline slowly approaching we would like to address the questions that have been brought up with the announcement of the Q4CMP Contest.
<br /><br />What gametypes does the Q4CMP seek to include?
<br /><br />    * We are accepting submissions that include support for any of the following gametypes: 1v1, Team Deathmatch, CTF, Arena CTF and DeadZone.
<br /><br />I understand custom textures cannot be used, but what about custom materials and fx files?
<br /><br />    * You may include custom script files such as fx and material files, but you may not include or reference custom textures, models or sound files.
<br /><br />How many entries am I allowed to submit?
<br /><br />    * Submit as many as you like! We are accepting both existing community maps that have already been released as well as new creations.
<br /><br />What format should I submit the map?
<br /><br />    * We prefer that maps be properly packaged with their .map, .proc, .cm, .def and loadscreen screenshot files, however can accept just the .map. The maps will be repackaged for both the voting process and final Community Pak.
<br /><br />Who will be judging the submissions?
<br /><br />    * You! As the deadline draws near be on the lookout for an offiicial polling station near you.
<br /><br />Where can I find community resources and tutorials on Quake 4 map making?
<br /><br />    * idDevNet
<br />    * Doom3World.org
<br />    * modwiki.net
<br />    * Quake3World.com
<br />    * Rust GameDesign

<br /><br />On windows I recommend using NTFS' junction points.  I have a dev tree, a vanilla tree, and a tree dedicated to my team's subversion repository, all on my data drive.  But Windows thinks I have just one install on my programs drive.  This is done by using linkd to junction C:\Program Files\Doom 3 to the specific install of the game I want to use.  This flexible setup will help windows and doom both forgive each other's differences when it comes to handling the filesystem.
<br /><br />It's a little complicated, but if you're juggling multiple trees it can really help.</div>

<br />well, its actually kinda simple <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />just check the sent in pk4 for any image files(which im sure they will allready do). off course ignore/replace the levelshot image. since you just use ingame textures to comply with you shader you merely use the game's base resources. or maybe just take an existing q4 shader and adjust it slightly like taking one of the texture layers out or simply change a certain blend effect
<br /><br />i know im kinda nagging with these questions, its just that its fun to take something limited and pulling something new off and see others do the same, not just geometry wise but also inventiveness.
<br /><br />if you cant break a limitation, you'd have to go around it id say <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>

						<div class="postbody">I thought I'd share the new contest details from id's site:
<br /><br />"Submissions for our Quake 4 Community Map Pak have begun rolling in and with the January 31st deadline slowly approaching we would like to address the questions that have been brought up with the announcement of the Q4CMP Contest.
<br /><br />What gametypes does the Q4CMP seek to include?
<br /><br />    * We are accepting submissions that include support for any of the following gametypes: 1v1, Team Deathmatch, CTF, Arena CTF and DeadZone.
<br /><br />I understand custom textures cannot be used, but what about custom materials and fx files?
<br /><br />    * You may include custom script files such as fx and material files, but you may not include or reference custom textures, models or sound files.
<br /><br />How many entries am I allowed to submit?
<br /><br />    * Submit as many as you like! We are accepting both existing community maps that have already been released as well as new creations.
<br /><br />What format should I submit the map?
<br /><br />    * We prefer that maps be properly packaged with their .map, .proc, .cm, .def and loadscreen screenshot files, however can accept just the .map. The maps will be repackaged for both the voting process and final Community Pak.
<br /><br />Who will be judging the submissions?
<br /><br />    * You! As the deadline draws near be on the lookout for an offiicial polling station near you.
<br /><br />Where can I find community resources and tutorials on Quake 4 map making?
<br /><br />    * idDevNet
<br />    * Doom3World.org
<br />    * modwiki.net
<br />    * Quake3World.com
<br />    * Rust GameDesign
<br /><br />Please feel free to submit all questions, inquiries or submissions to SyncError. "</div>

<br /><br />On windows I recommend using NTFS' junction points.  I have a dev tree, a vanilla tree, and a tree dedicated to my team's subversion repository, all on my data drive.  But Windows thinks I have just one install on my programs drive.  This is done by using linkd to junction C:\Program Files\Doom 3 to the specific install of the game I want to use.  This flexible setup will help windows and doom both forgive each other's differences when it comes to handling the filesystem.
<br /><br />It's a little complicated, but if you're juggling multiple trees it can really help.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p166292" date="Posted: Wed Jan 03, 2007 12:58 am "><author>bolleh</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">kat wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I'd reckon that's a no as well, you can imagine what that would be like to check... they'd have to looks at the syntax of each material to make sure it was actually correct and not a half arsed hack (like I'd do!) so as not to cause any rendering or general material system errors!.

<br />well, its actually kinda simple <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />just check the sent in pk4 for any image files(which im sure they will allready do). off course ignore/replace the levelshot image. since you just use ingame textures to comply with you shader you merely use the game's base resources. or maybe just take an existing q4 shader and adjust it slightly like taking one of the texture layers out or simply change a certain blend effect
<br /><br />i know im kinda nagging with these questions, its just that its fun to take something limited and pulling something new off and see others do the same, not just geometry wise but also inventiveness.
<br /><br />if you cant break a limitation, you'd have to go around it id say <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p166299" date="Posted: Wed Jan 03, 2007 1:38 am "><author>kat</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">It's not the assets that's the problem but the correct material syntax... they'd need to make sure that all the materials are technically correct for all render modes (vp and none vp).</div>]]></body></post><post id="p166453" date="Posted: Thu Jan 04, 2007 10:59 am "><author>Lukin</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">If so they should announce that.

<br /><br />"Submissions for our Quake 4 Community Map Pak have begun rolling in and with the January 31st deadline slowly approaching we would like to address the questions that have been brought up with the announcement of the Q4CMP Contest.
<br /><br />What gametypes does the Q4CMP seek to include?
<br /><br />    * We are accepting submissions that include support for any of the following gametypes: 1v1, Team Deathmatch, CTF, Arena CTF and DeadZone.
<br /><br />I understand custom textures cannot be used, but what about custom materials and fx files?
<br /><br />    * You may include custom script files such as fx and material files, but you may not include or reference custom textures, models or sound files.
<br /><br />How many entries am I allowed to submit?
<br /><br />    * Submit as many as you like! We are accepting both existing community maps that have already been released as well as new creations.
<br /><br />What format should I submit the map?
<br /><br />    * We prefer that maps be properly packaged with their .map, .proc, .cm, .def and loadscreen screenshot files, however can accept just the .map. The maps will be repackaged for both the voting process and final Community Pak.
<br /><br />Who will be judging the submissions?
<br /><br />    * You! As the deadline draws near be on the lookout for an offiicial polling station near you.
<br /><br />Where can I find community resources and tutorials on Quake 4 map making?
<br /><br />    * idDevNet
<br />    * Doom3World.org
<br />    * modwiki.net
<br />    * Quake3World.com
<br />    * Rust GameDesign
<br /><br />Please feel free to submit all questions, inquiries or submissions to SyncError.

But Windows thinks I have just one install on my programs drive.  This is done by using linkd to junction C:\Program Files\Doom 3 to the specific install of the game I want to use.  This flexible setup will help windows and doom both forgive each other's differences when it comes to handling the filesystem.

						<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">kat wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I'd reckon that's a no as well, you can imagine what that would be like to check... they'd have to looks at the syntax of each material to make sure it was actually correct and not a half arsed hack (like I'd do!) so as not to cause any rendering or general material system errors!. Quite a bit of work I would have thought  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /></div>
<br />well, its actually kinda simple <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />just check the sent in pk4 for any image files(which im sure they will allready do). off course ignore/replace the levelshot image. since you just use ingame textures to comply with you shader you merely use the game's base resources. or maybe just take an existing q4 shader and adjust it slightly like taking one of the texture layers out or simply change a certain blend effect
<br /><br />i know im kinda nagging with these questions, its just that its fun to take something limited and pulling something new off and see others do the same, not just geometry wise but also inventiveness.
<br /><br />if you cant break a limitation, you'd have to go around it id say <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>

<br /><br />"Submissions for our Quake 4 Community Map Pak have begun rolling in and with the January 31st deadline slowly approaching we would like to address the questions that have been brought up with the announcement of the Q4CMP Contest.
<br /><br />What gametypes does the Q4CMP seek to include?
<br /><br />    * We are accepting submissions that include support for any of the following gametypes: 1v1, Team Deathmatch, CTF, Arena CTF and DeadZone.
<br /><br />I understand custom textures cannot be used, but what about custom materials and fx files?
<br /><br />    * You may include custom script files such as fx and material files, but you may not include or reference custom textures, models or sound files.
<br /><br />How many entries am I allowed to submit?
<br /><br />    * Submit as many as you like! We are accepting both existing community maps that have already been released as well as new creations.
<br /><br />What format should I submit the map?
<br /><br />    * We prefer that maps be properly packaged with their .map, .proc, .cm, .def and loadscreen screenshot files, however can accept just the .map. The maps will be repackaged for both the voting process and final Community Pak.
<br /><br />Who will be judging the submissions?
<br /><br />    * You! As the deadline draws near be on the lookout for an offiicial polling station near you.
<br /><br />Where can I find community resources and tutorials on Quake 4 map making?
<br /><br />    * idDevNet
<br />    * Doom3World.org
<br />    * modwiki.net
<br />    * Quake3World.com
<br />    * Rust GameDesign
<br /><br />Please feel free to submit all questions, inquiries or submissions to SyncError. "</div>

<br /><br />On windows I recommend using NTFS' junction points.  I have a dev tree, a vanilla tree, and a tree dedicated to my team's subversion repository, all on my data drive.  But Windows thinks I have just one install on my programs drive.  This is done by using linkd to junction C:\Program Files\Doom 3 to the specific install of the game I want to use.  This flexible setup will help windows and doom both forgive each other's differences when it comes to handling the filesystem.
<br /><br />It's a little complicated, but if you're juggling multiple trees it can really help.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p166292" date="Posted: Wed Jan 03, 2007 12:58 am "><author>bolleh</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">kat wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I'd reckon that's a no as well, you can imagine what that would be like to check... they'd have to looks at the syntax of each material to make sure it was actually correct and not a half arsed hack (like I'd do!) so as not to cause any rendering or general material system errors!.

<br />well, its actually kinda simple <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />just check the sent in pk4 for any image files(which im sure they will allready do). off course ignore/replace the levelshot image. since you just use ingame textures to comply with you shader you merely use the game's base resources. or maybe just take an existing q4 shader and adjust it slightly like taking one of the texture layers out or simply change a certain blend effect
<br /><br />i know im kinda nagging with these questions, its just that its fun to take something limited and pulling something new off and see others do the same, not just geometry wise but also inventiveness.
<br /><br />if you cant break a limitation, you'd have to go around it id say <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p166299" date="Posted: Wed Jan 03, 2007 1:38 am "><author>kat</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">It's not the assets that's the problem but the correct material syntax... they'd need to make sure that all the materials are technically correct for all render modes (vp and none vp).</div>]]></body></post><post id="p166453" date="Posted: Thu Jan 04, 2007 10:59 am "><author>Lukin</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">If so they should announce that.

<br /><br />"Submissions for our Quake 4 Community Map Pak have begun rolling in and with the January 31st deadline slowly approaching we would like to address the questions that have been brought up with the announcement of the Q4CMP Contest.
<br /><br />What gametypes does the Q4CMP seek to include?
<br /><br />    * We are accepting submissions that include support for any of the following gametypes: 1v1, Team Deathmatch, CTF, Arena CTF and DeadZone.
<br /><br />I understand custom textures cannot be used, but what about custom materials and fx files?
<br /><br />    * You may include custom script files such as fx and material files, but you may not include or reference custom textures, models or sound files.
<br /><br />How many entries am I allowed to submit?
<br /><br />    * Submit as many as you like! We are accepting both existing community maps that have already been released as well as new creations.
<br /><br />What format should I submit the map?
<br /><br />    * We prefer that maps be properly packaged with their .map, .proc, .cm, .def and loadscreen screenshot files, however can accept just the .map. The maps will be repackaged for both the voting process and final Community Pak.
<br /><br />Who will be judging the submissions?
<br /><br />    * You! As the deadline draws near be on the lookout for an offiicial polling station near you.
<br /><br />Where can I find community resources and tutorials on Quake 4 map making?

But Windows thinks I have just one install on my programs drive.  This is done by using linkd to junction C:\Program Files\Doom 3 to the specific install of the game I want to use.  This flexible setup will help windows and doom both forgive each other's differences when it comes to handling the filesystem.

<br />well, its actually kinda simple <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />just check the sent in pk4 for any image files(which im sure they will allready do). off course ignore/replace the levelshot image. since you just use ingame textures to comply with you shader you merely use the game's base resources. or maybe just take an existing q4 shader and adjust it slightly like taking one of the texture layers out or simply change a certain blend effect
<br /><br />i know im kinda nagging with these questions, its just that its fun to take something limited and pulling something new off and see others do the same, not just geometry wise but also inventiveness.
<br /><br />if you cant break a limitation, you'd have to go around it id say <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>

						<div class="postbody">I thought I'd share the new contest details from id's site:
<br /><br />"Submissions for our Quake 4 Community Map Pak have begun rolling in and with the January 31st deadline slowly approaching we would like to address the questions that have been brought up with the announcement of the Q4CMP Contest.
<br /><br />What gametypes does the Q4CMP seek to include?
<br /><br />    * We are accepting submissions that include support for any of the following gametypes: 1v1, Team Deathmatch, CTF, Arena CTF and DeadZone.
<br /><br />I understand custom textures cannot be used, but what about custom materials and fx files?
<br /><br />    * You may include custom script files such as fx and material files, but you may not include or reference custom textures, models or sound files.
<br /><br />How many entries am I allowed to submit?
<br /><br />    * Submit as many as you like! We are accepting both existing community maps that have already been released as well as new creations.
<br /><br />What format should I submit the map?
<br /><br />    * We prefer that maps be properly packaged with their .map, .proc, .cm, .def and loadscreen screenshot files, however can accept just the .map. The maps will be repackaged for both the voting process and final Community Pak.
<br /><br />Who will be judging the submissions?
<br /><br />    * You! As the deadline draws near be on the lookout for an offiicial polling station near you.
<br /><br />Where can I find community resources and tutorials on Quake 4 map making?
<br /><br />    * idDevNet
<br />    * Doom3World.org
<br />    * modwiki.net
<br />    * Quake3World.com
<br />    * Rust GameDesign
<br /><br />Please feel free to submit all questions, inquiries or submissions to SyncError. "</div>

<br/><br/>
Correct.  Almost any map can include DM gametype support, but we do not wish entries that only support the DM gametype, as part of the reason for creating the pak is to increase the number of maps in the gametypes that need it most (ie, not DM).  If your map is by first nature just a DM map, I suggest that dependent on its size you make it either 1v1 or TDM compatible.</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

However this is my first ever multiplayer map and if you guys could just give me some feedback on how you feel it looks visually and atmospherically and any advice that'd be greatly greatly appreciated.&#13;
<br/><br/>
The map is ideally made for 1on1 DM, or 3on3 TDM. The inspiration was the sort of 'floating castles' featured in many fantasy novels, integrated with the harsh industrial style of Quake 4 for more of an 'oil rig' theme to it. Unfortuantely due to the rules against custom models the Rock Formations were made completely from splines, greatly harming performance.&#13;
<br/><br/>
As I say though this is my first ever multiplayer map so wasn't expecting too much, if anyone could give advice on how something like this could be enhanced visually though that'd be muchly appreciated! Cheers&#13;

<br/><br/>
Personally, there are a few things I'd change, but I'll stick with the two that stand out the most. First, the area in the last picture is way too dark. Lighten it up quite a bit. The other thing is the angled floating jumpads. Add detail and make them look like useful bases for the jumpads instead of triangles.&#13;
<br/><br/>
My favorite part of this map, I think, are the loading vehicles docked to receive the freight tanks. That is a great touch <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0"/><br/><br/>
[edit] You should probably post this in the WIP section instead of here.&#13;

I know what you mean about those specific features, to be honest though I didnt start those things until I was after the point of realising it wasn't going to be submitted, so the level of effort/enthusiasm was kinda small at that point.&#13;
<br/><br/>
I totally agree with you though, and if I ever rebuild this map I'll aim to keep the same level of detail everywhere. That room is kinda dark, contrasts a little too much with the outside style.&#13;
<br/><br/>
And im extreeeeeeemely glad you noticed the trucks recieving cargo <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0"/> I wasn't sure if anyone would notice that from these shots, I was scripting the crane to move along the arm too just to add to the detail. I'm glad you like it <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0"/><br/><br/>
