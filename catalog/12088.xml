I basically just wanted to make the Q3A weapons for the Doom engine but what I've decided in stead is to make them for Quake4.
<br /><br />I'll post the progress off the weapons here as I get work done on them. This is really just a side project for the pure fun of it. It's something I work on now and then just to get into something different from my usual stuff.
<br /><br />Here's some wip shots of the shotgun and the rocket launcher..

<br /><br />For the rocket launcher I've been doing some initial tests in the engine to see how the normal map works and so on. None of these are final shots.
<br /><br />What I'm trying to do with these weapons is basically get the original feel of the weapon but add some stuff here and there to make it feel more like it fits into this new engine.
<br /><br />I'm still not sure if I'll make all of them but I wanted to make the shotgun and rocket at the very least and probably the railgun. I've made another railgun previously but not a remake of Q3A so I'll make a new one for that. It's just such a cool gun to make.. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p109573" date="Posted: Mon Aug 22, 2005 1:07 pm "><author>zeh</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">They're looking cool. Could you add some render from the 'player' point of view?
<br /><br />Also, not as a criticism, but as a curiosity, are you using the original textures on that shots for now, or are they new?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p109577" date="Posted: Mon Aug 22, 2005 1:15 pm "><author>obihb</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks.  I'l post some view shots when i've made those models. It'll be pretty simple though, like in Q3A, just the barrel will be visible.
<br /><br />The textures are all new, I'm not re-using anything from Q3A. Just the screenshots to make the model from.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p109615" date="Posted: Mon Aug 22, 2005 3:37 pm "><author>_shank</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thats f*** sweet...only if we could use the clay rendered model <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p109965" date="Posted: Tue Aug 23, 2005 6:06 pm "><author>MelvinB</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">You already know my opinion.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />It's a shame Raven isn't sticking to Quake3's original weapon-models.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p110017" date="Posted: Wed Aug 24, 2005 3:49 am "><author>Duff</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">i want you to have my babys, although im pretty sure you're a male too so im not sure how we'd go about it. maybe render us some babys?  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_surprised.gif" alt=":o" title="Surprised" /><br /><br /><br /><br />any chance of you releasing these for DOOM 3? even if just to replace the gun models we have now to play around with in SP?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p110018" date="Posted: Wed Aug 24, 2005 3:57 am "><author>psyborg</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">models looks great.

<br /><br />I guess my initial tests would be inside Doom so maybe I can pack that up when they're finished and release them.
<br /><br />Good to see there are some other people that wanna see these weapons in the game as much as I do.. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p110058" date="Posted: Wed Aug 24, 2005 12:39 pm "><author>Daniel Schimmer</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Woo, looking forward to seeing that, awesome work dude!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p110075" date="Posted: Wed Aug 24, 2005 3:10 pm "><author>Vile</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Now that's fukking awesome obihb!!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /><br /><br />Please promise you will also make the BFG  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br />However, great work dude!!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p110086" date="Posted: Wed Aug 24, 2005 5:20 pm "><author>obihb</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks.
<br /><br />BFG?..  Is the BFG part of Q4 multiplayer?. I don't know. I'll see though, the idea was to only make some the weapons. I'll see later though what happens.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p110182" date="Posted: Thu Aug 25, 2005 1:19 pm "><author>obihb</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Ok, the UV's for this model just bugged the hell out of me so I just made the proper UV's to get it over with. I've also made basically the final normal map and new diffuse and spec. 
<br /><br />Although much can change as time goes by, this is pretty much what it'll end up looking like I think. At the very least I still need to do some tweaks on the diffuse map.

I'm really loving all your work. The shotgun is looking great and the rocket launcher too. But I think you've made the barrel on the rocket launch way to shiny (too much specularity) and also a bit too bumpy. I always loved the smooth look of the rocket launcher, making it look like it was just too perfectly smooth to be used as a weapon (whatever that means...).
<br /><br />Also, I'm just curious which program you use, and how do you get those lovely clay renders?
<br /><br />Keep it up, and I look forward to your next weapon(s)!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p110530" date="Posted: Sun Aug 28, 2005 10:33 am "><author>obihb</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks..
<br /><br />I can play more with bumpyness an spec for sure. Definately need to work more on diffuse aswell.
<br /><br />I model everything using 3DS Max.
<br /><br />The renders for the shotgun are done with Mental Ray and I apply a "Ambient/Reflective Occlusion" material as the diffuse map to get the effect of global light plus normal blinn shading. The big shot with shadow casting on the ground was rendered with Brazil, skylight plus area light.
<br /><br />The rocket is rendered with Brazil using the skylight plus area light.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p110536" date="Posted: Sun Aug 28, 2005 11:32 am "><author>SyPHer_</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks for the tips, got some lovely renders going now, and they don't take too long either!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p120184" date="Posted: Sat Nov 05, 2005 5:46 am "><author>Cyper</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Those look fantastic, the skins look like they need a little work, but nothing too bad.
<br /><br />I had a look at your site, maybe make the barrel, or any metal part of the guns the same type of metal texture that you used on your female DFMARINE you made if possible, it looks fantastic on there.
<br /><br />BTW - I want the ninja turtle model for my player model in EVERY game i play ;D</div>]]></body></post><post id="p120205" date="Posted: Sat Nov 05, 2005 11:10 am "><author>obihb</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks..
<br /><br />Yeah, the textures at the momemt are WIP although probably about 80% of what I'd like for a final texture on the RL.
<br /><br />The metal material on that female model is probably not able to work in the game engine because of what I did to make it inside Max. Although I've noticed in Quake4 they do have some reflective surfaces like a brushed metal type look, so maybe it could be possible to get something similar. I'll definately take a look at those things when I get to that point.
<br /><br />The Turtle.. yeah.. heheheee..   I'm also a really big Turtles fan. I would like to at some point make him a player at least in Quake4. I wanted to for Doom3 but I never liked the multiplayer in D3 and I don't think it was that popular in the rest of the world so it didn't feel worth making. Maybe Q4 does better then it'll be worth making a Turtle playable character.. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post></posts></thread></xml>
