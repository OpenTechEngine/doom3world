Apparently, it was supposed to be a lot bigger, but it had to be reduced in size, as it caused crashes, I believe.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p184864" date="Posted: Tue Jul 31, 2007 12:29 pm "><author>Hexen Terzo</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">yeah looks great!!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p184960" date="Posted: Wed Aug 01, 2007 1:53 pm "><author>vinnie_jones</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">i like these mitm stuff altho they all lag me to a grindin halt hehe</div>]]></body></post><post id="p187081" date="Posted: Thu Aug 23, 2007 4:07 am "><author>ColdT</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">vinnie_jones wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">i like these mitm stuff altho they all lag me to a grindin halt hehe</div>Sorry performance is not great for you, vinnie. I feel the same - my old P4 2.4 + Radeon 9800Pro is really holding me back. When we do get an upgrade though, we'll have lots of stuff to replay  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /><br /><br />The latest news is that this project has turned into two maps. Ghetto 1 is as described above. It is a classic make it to morning i.e. find guns and ammo while it is light; when it gets dark, all hell breaks loose... can you make it to morning? It has an experimental pop-up script that improves performance a little but at the expense of too much work for me so don't expect me to develop it further.<br /><br />Ghetto 2 is an arcade style map. It has three areas: a busy road where you can shoot cars for health and ammo; a landfill site where you can scavenge some goodies and a carpark/alley where you fight waves of beasts and blowup stuff.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p187164" date="Posted: Fri Aug 24, 2007 12:19 am "><author>vinnie_jones</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">well its not THAT bad generally, its, obviously, when theres like<br />10 trites and 8 lost souls (least fav enemy in doom btw but nm ^^)<br />spawning at the exact same time that the lag occurs,<br />this new map/s seems cool, wanna try them !  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p187236" date="Posted: Fri Aug 24, 2007 9:40 pm "><author>Bo$bevok</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">i like these maps and i eagerly await this ghetto chapter.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p187387" date="Posted: Mon Aug 27, 2007 5:04 pm "><author>Paveway</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Do those screenshots use original RoE texture or are there some custom ones?
