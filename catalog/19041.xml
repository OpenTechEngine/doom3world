<br />I've been using 9.0 for testing and it looks like it should work with both 9 and 9.2.  I haven't gotten anything into the game engine yet.  The last test I did was to load a mesh from the game, export it back out and use dertons' viewer to look at it.  I'll definitely try to have some kind of guide for setting up and transferring assets between the two.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p178572" date="Posted: Sun May 20, 2007 1:14 am "><author>clintonman</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">It's done. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205022501im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br />The Lightwave plugins for importing and exporting meshes and animations is done.  It has been tested in lw9 and 9.2 but probably works back to version 6.5 or 7.  Next up is to completely redo the website with proper instructions.

I know what I'm doing in the modeller, but have almost no experience with layout/scenes.<br /><br />I load my character into the layout (skelegon layer already deleted).  I select all the layers objects, but I can find no way to "run MD5_BoneLoad".  <br /><br />When I go to utilities--&gt;plugins, there is no "generic" or "generic plugins" tab.  When I go to "additional", the MD5 plugins do not show up.  I know they are installed, as I already loaded the md5mesh.  When I go to "edit plugins" I find "MD5_Boneload" listed as a "Layout Command" plugin, but I still have no idea how to run it.<br /><br />Any help would be appreciated.<br /><br />edit: here's an image, showing how nothing appears in the 'additional plugins' window, yet the md5 plugins show up when I open the edit plugins window.  They seem to be there, so how the heck do I access them?<br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205022501im_/http://www.mindplaces.com/save/lightwave1.jpg" alt="Image" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p195885" date="Posted: Sun Mar 02, 2008 8:00 pm "><author>clintonman</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Looks like you have a lot of plugins missing from the utilites-additional menu.

I tracked down a single mesh that was causing it, and when I redid the mesh the error went away.<br /><br />Still having one problem, however.  I've successfully used the exporter for a few heads and the werebeast above, so I went for broke and tried modifying one of our existing md5mesh characters.  <br /><br />Everything seemed to go smoothly...I got no errors and the game loads fine.  Unfortunately, this is what I get:<br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205022659im_/http://www.mindplaces.com/save/md5_2.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />The animations actually play normally, but the upper torso is rotated ninety degrees at the belt (actually a single mesh is cut in half there, as the whole tunic is a single mesh).  Everything else seems perfect.

<br />I've been using 9.0 for testing and it looks like it should work with both 9 and 9.2.  I haven't gotten anything into the game engine yet.  The last test I did was to load a mesh from the game, export it back out and use dertons' viewer to look at it.  I'll definitely try to have some kind of guide for setting up and transferring assets between the two.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p178572" date="Posted: Sun May 20, 2007 2:14 am "><author>clintonman</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">It's done. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225075915im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br />The Lightwave plugins for importing and exporting meshes and animations is done.  It has been tested in lw9 and 9.2 but probably works back to version 6.5 or 7.  Next up is to completely redo the website with proper instructions.

I had one mesh/layer pointing to two different uvmaps, and the exporter only recognized the first one.  It was an easy fix.<br /><br />The second issue is less of a deal-breaker, but it's still a bit perplexing.  I have a series of rings with a transparent hair texture around the shoulders.  The shader is here:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">models/mymodels/werewolf_hair<br />     {<br />    twosided<br />    nonsolid<br /><br />     {  blend   diffusemap<br />       map models/md5/chars/monsters/werebeast/werewolf_hair_d.tga<br />        alphaTest 0.5         }<br /><br />        bumpmap models/md5/chars/monsters/werebeast/werewolf_hair_local.tga<br />        }</div><br /><br />On the .lwo (left, below) the hair actually appears two-sided, as I would expect.

Unfortunately, this is what I get:<br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225081830im_/http://www.mindplaces.com/save/md5_2.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />The animations actually play normally, but the upper torso is rotated ninety degrees at the belt (actually a single mesh is cut in half there, as the whole tunic is a single mesh).  Everything else seems perfect.  Oddly, when I load the map in the editor, the AI look correct, and even play their animations normally.<br /><br />Any suggestions of what might cause that?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p197927" date="Posted: Wed Apr 23, 2008 3:25 am "><author>Springheel</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Well, after a lot of testing and teeth gnashing, I figured out what the problem was, though not why it happened.

<br />I've been using 9.0 for testing and it looks like it should work with both 9 and 9.2.  I haven't gotten anything into the game engine yet.  The last test I did was to load a mesh from the game, export it back out and use dertons' viewer to look at it.  I'll definitely try to have some kind of guide for setting up and transferring assets between the two.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p178572" date="Posted: Sun May 20, 2007 2:14 am "><author>clintonman</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">It's done. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225075915im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br />The Lightwave plugins for importing and exporting meshes and animations is done.  It has been tested in lw9 and 9.2 but probably works back to version 6.5 or 7.  Next up is to completely redo the website with proper instructions.

I'm thinking that the coordinates for the head are in a really tight group so that the only thing visible is the color of a single pixel. I have a pretty good idea on how to test that. Add a scrolling additive map to your material shader. Something simple like this...<br /><br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">			<img src="download/file.php?id=90" alt="pinkband.png" /><br /><span class="gensmall">pinkband.png [ 475 Bytes | Viewed 1094 times ]</span>

I had one mesh/layer pointing to two different uvmaps, and the exporter only recognized the first one.  It was an easy fix.<br /><br />The second issue is less of a deal-breaker, but it's still a bit perplexing.  I have a series of rings with a transparent hair texture around the shoulders.  The shader is here:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">models/mymodels/werewolf_hair<br />     {<br />    twosided<br />    nonsolid<br /><br />     {  blend   diffusemap<br />       map models/md5/chars/monsters/werebeast/werewolf_hair_d.tga<br />        alphaTest 0.5         }<br /><br />        bumpmap models/md5/chars/monsters/werebeast/werewolf_hair_local.tga<br />        }</div><br /><br />On the .lwo (left, below) the hair actually appears two-sided, as I would expect.  On the md5mesh, however (below, right), it is NOT two-sided.  When you look from below it isn't there at all (but, it is correct when viewed from the top, so it's not a uvmap issue).<br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225080657im_/http://www.mindplaces.com/save/werebeast2.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Any idea why it would be twosided in the .lwo but not the .md5mesh?  Are there other keywords I should try?  I've tested the ones I could think of without effect.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p197068" date="Posted: Fri Mar 28, 2008 4:36 am "><author>rich_is_bored</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Looks like I'm going to be 1 for 2 because I'm not sure what would cause that.<br /><br />Have you tried exporting the model with the "two-sided" setting for your surface disabled in Lightwave? MD5meshes don't have a cooresponding property so it shouldn't make a difference but without any real idea as to what would cause that anything could be suspect.<br /><br />Another thing to try is to use "twoSided" with a capital S in your material shader as opposed to how you have it now.

<br />I've been using 9.0 for testing and it looks like it should work with both 9 and 9.2.  I haven't gotten anything into the game engine yet.  The last test I did was to load a mesh from the game, export it back out and use dertons' viewer to look at it.

<br />I've been using 9.0 for testing and it looks like it should work with both 9 and 9.2.  I haven't gotten anything into the game engine yet.  The last test I did was to load a mesh from the game, export it back out and use dertons' viewer to look at it.

It has been tested in lw9 and 9.2 but probably works back to version 6.5 or 7.  Next up is to completely redo the website with proper instructions.

<br />I've been using 9.0 for testing and it looks like it should work with both 9 and 9.2.  I haven't gotten anything into the game engine yet.  The last test I did was to load a mesh from the game, export it back out and use dertons' viewer to look at it.  I'll definitely try to have some kind of guide for setting up and transferring assets between the two.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p178572" date="Posted: Sun May 20, 2007 1:14 am "><author>clintonman</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">It's done. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br />The Lightwave plugins for importing and exporting meshes and animations is done.  It has been tested in lw9 and 9.2 but probably works back to version 6.5 or 7.  Next up is to completely redo the website with proper instructions.

I know what I'm doing in the modeller, but have almost no experience with layout/scenes.<br /><br />I load my character into the layout (skelegon layer already deleted).  I select all the layers objects, but I can find no way to "run MD5_BoneLoad".  <br /><br />When I go to utilities--&gt;plugins, there is no "generic" or "generic plugins" tab.  When I go to "additional", the MD5 plugins do not show up.  I know they are installed, as I already loaded the md5mesh.  When I go to "edit plugins" I find "MD5_Boneload" listed as a "Layout Command" plugin, but I still have no idea how to run it.<br /><br />Any help would be appreciated.<br /><br />edit: here's an image, showing how nothing appears in the 'additional plugins' window, yet the md5 plugins show up when I open the edit plugins window.
