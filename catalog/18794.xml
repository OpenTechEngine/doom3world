<br /><br />You have to bake the normals of the highpoly onto the low poly by any of the following method:-
<br /><br />1. Use the integrated Doom3 normal baker.

<br /><br />Take a screenshot of your gun from every axis and use it as a backdrop image in LightWave. Then model your gun on top of that.
<br /><br />You can also keep your highpoly in a background layer and model your lowpoly according to that.

<br /><br />You have to bake the normals of the highpoly onto the low poly by any of the following method:-
<br /><br />1. Use the integrated Doom3 normal baker.
<br />2. Use the software you are using to bake it.

<br /><br />Take a screenshot of your gun from every axis and use it as a backdrop image in LightWave. Then model your gun on top of that.
<br /><br />You can also keep your highpoly in a background layer and model your lowpoly according to that.

You have to bake the normals of the highpoly onto the low poly by any of the following method:-&#13;
<br/><br/>
1. Use the integrated Doom3 normal baker.&#13;
<br/>
2. Use the software you are using to bake it.&#13;

Take a screenshot of your gun from every axis and use it as a backdrop image in LightWave. Then model your gun on top of that.&#13;
<br/><br/>
You can also keep your highpoly in a background layer and model your lowpoly according to that.&#13;
<br/><br/>
I usually model something with a few thousand polygons and use this model for both - manual optimization for a lowpoly and as a base to increase detail.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/" target="_blank" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/site/img/d3w.gif" border="0"/> Staff - The world is yours</a>, soon in 6 degrees of freedom!&#13;

I understand that i have to make a low poly now and apply the normal map/height map/bump map or something to the low poly, uv map it and then get it into the game? &#13;
<br/><br/>
Here are some quick shots of the high-poly model, I'm not too big on detail; I just wanted to get it done and finished and figure this whole thing out so I know how to do it for future purposes. Very poor lighting and angles, I know. &#13;

<br/><br/>
Now, my question is, how should I start making the low-poly model? Where do I start to make it as identical as possible? Then once I'm finished with that, how/what do I do with the normal map thing? If you guys could guide me through the process, that'd be great.<br/>_________________<br/>.Mods.C++.Animation.Graphics.Doom.WebDesign.&#13;

How do I 'create' a normal map? All I know how to do from here on out is make the low poly, and uv map it. &#13;

You have to bake the normals of the highpoly onto the low poly by any of the following method:-&#13;
<br/><br/>
1. Use the integrated Doom3 normal baker.&#13;
<br/>
2. Use the software you are using to bake it.&#13;
<br/><br/>

Take a screenshot of your gun from every axis and use it as a backdrop image in LightWave. Then model your gun on top of that.&#13;
<br/><br/>
You can also keep your highpoly in a background layer and model your lowpoly according to that.&#13;
<br/><br/>
I usually model something with a few thousand polygons and use this model for both - manual optimization for a lowpoly and as a base to increase detail.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/" target="_blank" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/site/img/d3w.gif" border="0"/> Staff - The world is yours</a>, soon in 6 degrees of freedom!&#13;
