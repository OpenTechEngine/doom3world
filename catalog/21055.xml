That doesn't say anything about the quality of work and the special knowledge that sounddesigners can use to create unique sounds for their needs. If anything, my post only underlines that fact that it's something a person needs to learn and hone his/her skills.<br /><br />But an announcer voice isn't rocket science, it's just that what I said: pitch, reverb, some delay and perhaps a chorus for extra effect. We shouldn't make sounddesign look harder than it is.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p193774" date="Posted: Sat Jan 12, 2008 1:16 pm "><author>Douglas Quaid</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">let's shake on it <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081204151441im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081204151441/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z9NUxQLvWg">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z9NUxQLvWg</a><!-- m --></div>]]></body></post><post id="p193779" date="Posted: Sat Jan 12, 2008 4:28 pm "><author>TTK-Bandit</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">will try it, thanx..<br />I know its better to have an audio artist for this stuff, but I don't have one, so I gotta improvise something.<br /><br />edit:<br />ok, kind of a short trial period, it stopped playing back my sample after 2-3 minutes, now all I can do is check out the interface without hearing anything.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p193781" date="Posted: Sat Jan 12, 2008 6:39 pm "><author>Douglas Quaid</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">just upload your samples and ill do it for you</div>]]></body></post><post id="p193807" date="Posted: Sun Jan 13, 2008 10:51 am "><author>TTK-Bandit</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">thanx, but 1.
