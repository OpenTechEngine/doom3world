<br /><br />Use a Sub/Multi Material insteed of a Standard one in the material editor, and then apply it to the model.

<br /><br />Don´t know about the performance, but it´s probably reasonable to export only the moving parts as md5 because md5s don´t come with a collision model.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p172564" date="Posted: Fri Mar 09, 2007 12:10 pm "><author>6th Venom</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">mikebart wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Sorry to step in with another question but how much difference would it make in regards to performance if I were to export a building as an animated md5mesh, with curtains flapping and Ivy swaying in the wind?</div>
<br /><br />Using a MD5mesh rather than an ASE will not do anything in performance hit, performances are more about how many lights per face/poly in the scene, how complex is the shadow calculation, and visportals.
<br /><br />The way i'll do if i should, be to create the whole thing into one md5mesh, and create a simple clip model and export it as a ASE, applying on it a clip material.
