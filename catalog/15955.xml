Anyway, glad to read it brought a couple of "heh"s out of your crusty old self, Zombie13. That's enough to make it all worthwhile. That, and the babes it will get me! &#13;

Here's a screenshot from Duck Nukem, for those too intelligent to waste their time downloading my mods:&#13;

I use GOD mode and/or GIVE ALL for all my gaming needs!&#13;

I have NO idea if this mod can actually be beaten by standard play, as I never had a chance to run through it before the deadline, sorry! I'm going to look into what makes "good game play" now that I have the time. (Any recommended tutorials greatly appreciated)&#13;
<br/><br/>
The mod's really all about the rock and roll anyway! <img src="/web/20070213092436im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0"/><br/><br/>

I haven't have enough time to finish your mod yet, but I like it so far. I had to use GOD mode from the very start.  I really don't mind those mapping "mistakes" at all, I think it's part of the style.  Anyway, congrats!</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

I left the remainder of the HUD items I found in your mod in case anyone was poking around. I didn't use them, just the text display, but they sure are worth people checking out. That HUD text display is awesome, because it'd be really easy to make multi-language patches.
