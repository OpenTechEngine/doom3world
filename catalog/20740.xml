It is set one month after the main events in Prey and follows Tommy after his first victory, when he discovers that the Dark Ones have returned and a seemingly omnipotent force is slowly unravelling his reality.<br /><br />For the second episode, I need a voice actor to play the part of Enisi, Tommy's grandfather. If you haven't played the game, Enisi is a wise old man, who teaches and advises Tommy.<br />There are 5 lines you'll have to pronounce, which comprise a dialogue between Tommy and Enisi. Please PM me if you're interested.</div>]]></body></post></posts></thread></xml>
