Outside of these (hopefully) rare situations, the panel is transparent and the project goes how it is going now. The only other thing I think they should do is to try and sort out any differing opinions among participants of the project.

Popular people win (And people are unlikely to educade themselves about a person before making a decision) Thats the reason I'd like to have a well thought out argument for the decisions made, they have the capacity to change peoples opinions as well as explain things and educate people of the unknown. You could educate people of your past or the past of a nominee.
<br /><br />Im also having my doubts about a panel, at which point do we consider a decision made if there isnt one person there to keep the peace? Or listen to other peoples ideas and make a decision based on that? If there isnt anyone there to decide, and the panel is too big or people dont want to budge from they're ideas then chaos breaks loose.
<br /><br />So I guess what Im trying to say is Im fine with a panel if the right people are chosen. Responsible people with skill, experience, and knowledge.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p67820" date="Posted: Wed Dec 15, 2004 3:11 am "><author>blushing_bride</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">have a three person panel, say rich_is_bored, goliath as they are close to the project and BNA as well cos he's slightly on the outside and can therefore have a different perspective. 
<br /><br />Three people can make quick decisions. For example they look at my building and 2 of them think it has too many brushes then they can say that they as a group think it needs changing. That way none of them will have to say "hey your building is poop" they can say "we decided your building is poop".
