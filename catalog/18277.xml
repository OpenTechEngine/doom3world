<br /><br />There are vast amount of tutorials on rigging a model for animation. And few few on the actual animating. 
<br /><br />The 2 common way to animate are FK(Forward Kinematic) &amp; IK(Inverse Kinematics).
<br /><br />Most .md5 exporters I have used support the 2 different ways, however using the FK to animate will most likely cause less problems when it comes to exporting to the .md5 format.
<br /><br />It has been a while since I used a .md5 exporter so this could have all changed.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p166215" date="Posted: Tue Jan 02, 2007 2:55 am "><author>hellborg</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">For md5mesh output, you need to use armature animation. It does not matter which IK setup you use to help with animation, as it is anyways *not* exported to the md5mesh file. You can setup an IK to help design your animation, but depending on your IK setup you might need to bake the animation before exporting it.
<br /><br />The workflow is pretty simple, you make your armature, parent it to your triangulated mesh, you name the bones, most importantly the origin bone as the reference for the game engine. You can automatically assign, name and apply weights for skin deformation and you can then edit the weight with weight painting. You animate, you bake the animation, sometimes you need to bake the scaling, rotations, etc and you can then use ton's exporter to generate the md5mesh. I then usually manally asign the materials by editing the md5mesh.
<br /><br />The simplest thing to get started is probably to first import a Doom3 mesh (with ton's importer), examine it, modify it, or generate a new animation, and then to use the exporter and test the results in the game engine. It's pretty straightforward.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p166222" date="Posted: Tue Jan 02, 2007 5:52 am "><author>motorsep</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Ic.. thanks for advice.

I find FK being easier to animate with but can give a more unrealistic movement if your not carefull.
<br /><br />IK is abit harder to rigg up, but can give more fluent animation.
