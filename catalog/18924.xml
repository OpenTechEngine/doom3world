<br /><br />The game will not check in what mtr the materials are stored, so you can't point a mymaterials.mtr file directly.
<br /><br />Another thing important is that your ASE must have only one material inside (see *MATERIAL_COUNT 1 in it to check), cause if not, i think the engine automaticly take the last one.
<br />(to be sure to export only one, check that you got only one material in your whole scene before exporting selected object)
<br /><br />And last, seams you don't need a skin file in your case, cause you just want to apply your original texture on your ase.
<br />Skins are here to make different versions of a model, applying on it different variance of its texture. (like a orangesuitzombie, redsuitzombie, greysuitzombie, etc...)
