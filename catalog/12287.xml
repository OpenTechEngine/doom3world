<br /><br /> i dont think it would be completely safe to make a switch though since zbrush looks to be more for 3D painting and sculping modeling,

<br /><br />If it's for a game, you can make the model with zspheres in just a couple of minutes, then you export it to your 3d app. 
<br /><br />In the 3d app, you add a good edge flow for animation and reduce or increase the poly amount to what you want your ingame model to have, then you export that back into zbrush, and start to add details for your normal map extraction.

<br /><br />If it's for a game, you can make the model with zspheres in just a couple of minutes, then you export it to your 3d app. 
<br /><br />In the 3d app, you add a good edge flow for animation and reduce or increase the poly amount to what you want your ingame model to have, then you export that back into zbrush, and start to add details for your normal map extraction.
