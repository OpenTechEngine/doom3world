<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Inside 3D Studio Max 2: Vol 1 (New Riders)</span>
<br />2.5" thick cinder block of a book. A little outdated, but still very good and in-depth. There might be a newer version. Volume 2 and 3 I didn't bother getting since I never got all the way through volume 1 yet.
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">3D Studio Max 3 Magic (New Riders)</span>
<br />Mainly for special effects and animation. Not much use for the average game developer.
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">3ds MAX 4 Workshop (QUE)</span>
<br />Mainly for the whole cinematic animation workflow. Good for animators, not for game developers.
<br /><br />Also several other books from <span style="font-weight: bold">Ballistic</span> dealing with CG techniques in general which are a good read.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p166082" date="Posted: Sun Dec 31, 2006 8:13 pm "><author>obsidian</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">BTW, isn't 3ds MAX 9 out now?
