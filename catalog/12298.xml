Ssh, don't tell Zakath- he'll yell at me for not working on the mod. (Zakath, dearest- I love you but I have to enlarge my skill base.)
<br /><br />I'm going to do a horse's eye. A bit of the surrounding area made it into the model, but the focus here is going to be on the area around the eye itself. I thought it would be a fun way to practice making fine surface details like wrinkles and muscle bulges and folds. I made the original mesh in LightWave, and have only subdivided it once so far. I think I'll post one screenshot every couple of subdivision levels.

<br />3. Yes, the tool is all you need to save. The document is just a 2d image. If you change your alphas or add a texture, you can save them in the tool.
<br />4. Yes and No, It's easier to start with a mouse, because then you use the move tool, and not the pressure sensitive draw tool. I did my WIP with the mouse, my update was made with a tablet.
<br />5. Add ALT to that list, to inverse the tool, and SHIFT to toggle smooth. Also CTRL + 1 will repeat the last stroke, both when sculpting and painting.
<br />6. The only thing you need is the T for edit mode, the W and R are used to position objects on the canvas. It's just used if you want to make a zbrush drawing, instead of modelling, or want to position 3d objects when you use the projection master.
<br />7. Shift will also snap your rotations.
<br /><br />About number 2.
<br /><br /><br />If you want to export your model to a game, you should complete the edge flow and polycount on it before you import, you can then edit it, and aslong as you don't delete the lowest subdivision level, you can export it back. To start with zspheres, export to LW, clean the mesh up, and then import it, should be the best workflow. I'm no expert yet, so don't take my word for it just yet <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205065933im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />And don't forget to go throught the zscript tutorials! then get awesome free zbrush video tutorials from kurvstudios.com...</div>]]></body></post><post id="p111570" date="Posted: Tue Sep 06, 2005 1:45 am "><author>Sparky</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205065933/http://img209.imageshack.us/my.php?image=horseeye027du.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205065933im_/http://img209.imageshack.us/img209/7418/horseeye027du.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>

<br />Questions and notes:<ol style="list-style-type: arabic-numbers"><li>Go into projection master mode by pressing G, then enter. Do the same thing to go back to edit mode. (Thanks again, 1eyed!)

Donno, here are some ideas.
<br /><br />Diffuse, clone your texture, fill it with a color, paint with only RGB and no material or shading. In  the projection master, only pickup color, no material or shading
<br /><br />Specular, clone your texture, fill it with grey or white, render your shading into it, then tweak it to make a specular.
<br /><br />3. You can uvmap before you import a model
<br /><br />I'd recommend you practice before you go start a new project. Do all zscripts tutorials! From your questions I know you didn't do it before you started this <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205065933im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />then, you HAVE TO GET THIS!

<br /><br />The Practical Guide is comprised of nearly 500 pages of tutorials. Introductory tutorials teach the ZBrush 2 interface, including such topics as the new curve controls and creating a startup document.

Donno, here are some ideas.
<br /><br />Diffuse, clone your texture, fill it with a color, paint with only RGB and no material or shading. In  the projection master, only pickup color, no material or shading
<br /><br />Specular, clone your texture, fill it with grey or white, render your shading into it, then tweak it to make a specular.
<br /><br />3. You can uvmap before you import a model
<br /><br />I'd recommend you practice before you go start a new project. Do all zscripts tutorials! From your questions I know you didn't do it before you started this <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205070000im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />then, you HAVE TO GET THIS! The Zbrush 2 practical guide.
<br /><br />The Practical Guide is comprised of nearly 500 pages of tutorials. Introductory tutorials teach the ZBrush 2 interface, including such topics as the new curve controls and creating a startup document.

<br /><br />Diffuse, clone your texture, fill it with a color, paint with only RGB and no material or shading. In  the projection master, only pickup color, no material or shading

Donno, here are some ideas.
<br /><br />Diffuse, clone your texture, fill it with a color, paint with only RGB and no material or shading. In  the projection master, only pickup color, no material or shading
<br /><br />Specular, clone your texture, fill it with grey or white, render your shading into it, then tweak it to make a specular.
<br /><br />3. You can uvmap before you import a model
<br /><br />I'd recommend you practice before you go start a new project. Do all zscripts tutorials! From your questions I know you didn't do it before you started this <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />then, you HAVE TO GET THIS!

Ssh, don't tell Zakath- he'll yell at me for not working on the mod. (Zakath, dearest- I love you but I have to enlarge my skill base.)
<br /><br />I'm going to do a horse's eye. A bit of the surrounding area made it into the model, but the focus here is going to be on the area around the eye itself. I thought it would be a fun way to practice making fine surface details like wrinkles and muscle bulges and folds. I made the original mesh in LightWave, and have only subdivided it once so far. I think I'll post one screenshot every couple of subdivision levels.

<br />3. Yes, the tool is all you need to save. The document is just a 2d image. If you change your alphas or add a texture, you can save them in the tool.
<br />4. Yes and No, It's easier to start with a mouse, because then you use the move tool, and not the pressure sensitive draw tool. I did my WIP with the mouse, my update was made with a tablet.
<br />5. Add ALT to that list, to inverse the tool, and SHIFT to toggle smooth. Also CTRL + 1 will repeat the last stroke, both when sculpting and painting.
<br />6. The only thing you need is the T for edit mode, the W and R are used to position objects on the canvas. It's just used if you want to make a zbrush drawing, instead of modelling, or want to position 3d objects when you use the projection master.
<br />7. Shift will also snap your rotations.
<br /><br />About number 2.
