It is a free 3D game, tank kick cars' ass game.<br />It is with DOOM3 style -- DARK <span style="color: #FF0000">(EDIT: And silly darkness is the only thing you may construct as a far fetched similarity to Doom3)</span><br />You are travel in a dark world, especially in the night mode, you rely on the spot light of your tank.<br />It is real dark, not fake.<br />When I start to create a new game on android just after playing DOOM3 the 10th time, I think, it's better in DOOM3 style, mistery in the dark!<br /><br />It's cool that I finished it, you know, game programming is very hard for none game developer, you must read many book on this subject,maths,physics,opengl,special effects,lighting.....<br />It is frustrated sometimes, at that time, I play DOOM3 or RAGE for a while, and think if john carmack come accross this problem, how can he do?
