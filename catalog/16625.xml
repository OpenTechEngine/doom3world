<br /><br />HDR is hard to work with in still images, it looks better in gameplay while in screenshots it will always be a certain exposure, the exposure depends on the location and the orientation of the player at the time.
<br />So the HDR won't be toned down.
<br /><br />Regarding the "little things" there is only a few things I can do.
<br /><br />I would probably need some models and may be some new materials altogether. Grass is present but I can add the sprite counterpart to the replace the current grass texture seen in the screenshot.
<br /><br />Thanks for the comments so far,

<br /><br />Regarding the "little things" there is only a few things I can do.
<br /><br />I would probably need some models and may be some new materials altogether. Grass is present but I can add the sprite counterpart to the replace the current grass texture seen in the screenshot.
<br /><br />Thanks for the comments so far,
