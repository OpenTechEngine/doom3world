<br />So...almost two years after making those models for doom3, I started to be really fed up by the ton of virtual dust they accumulated, so I decided to convert and release them for quake 4, at least they could be of some use for someone...
<br /><br />anyways, starting with the idgirl, original concept by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203103031/http://www.barontieri.com/" class="postlink">BARoNTiERi</a>
<br /><br />she weights something like 2600 tris, 512 textures for the body, 256 for the head, 128 for the mask and 64 for the hair

<br /><br />And now, the Spaceman, concept by barontieri again.
<br />2022 tris, 1024 for the body, 512 for the head and 128 for the mask

<br /><br />Quake 4 and the latest patch are needed.
<br /><br />I'm mostly looking for bug and rigging issues, but as usual comments and critics are more than welcome, just keep in mind that these models are almost 2 years old, so FAR from what I could do now ( my next project being the gorre model remake, as I took part in the q3 remix thingie over at polycount <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203103031im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />)
<br /><br />Pleas don't spread them too much, these are not the final releases and are more likely subject to change before final, I will make sure to go as fast as possible to release them to the worldwideintarweb.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p143820" date="Posted: Mon May 22, 2006 6:50 am "><author>kat</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Jeez!
