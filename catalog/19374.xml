<br /><br />I am working on my map named Beta Labs. I will create a mappack with about 4 maps: beta labs sector 1, blabs sector 2, sector 3 and hell. This is my first map(pack), so it doesnt look so professional.
<br /><br />There are some of screens of my map (updated):

But it also looks like everything is on the same horizontal level - if that´s true, try to add some height variation, a second floor, walkways and the like. Some vertical combat, not just horizontal.
<br /><br />Also giving the whole map a "lab" theme again is a bit unoriginal, though it doesn´t matter if the gameplay is good <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081117071452im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p176863" date="Posted: Thu Apr 26, 2007 7:25 pm "><author>mfh1900</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">it is not a horizontal level, because i have some stairs. even if u dont like my map - it is my first map i made, so it is not a professional map</div>]]></body></post><post id="p176866" date="Posted: Thu Apr 26, 2007 8:09 pm "><author>efx</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">mfh1900 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">it is not a horizontal level, because i have some stairs. even if u dont like my map - it is my first map i made.

<br /><br />If you're going to post your work here you're going to have to expect to take critiscm. I don't know if it's a language thing here but you're coming across as a bit defensive.
<br /><br />Might as well give some comments too. What I like is that you're aligning the textures well and that's fairly uncommon for people starting out. The architecture, while somewhat flat as someone stated and maybe a bit boxy looks believable enough to be a real structure.
<br /><br />My negative points are that if you need a flashlight to show off your map it's too dark. In general the map could do with a bit more light in it. Also, in the 4th screenshot from the top with the busted little pipe with the fire coming out  I wouldn't seal the pipe with a patch like you did but rather create an inside pipe that's a little smaller than the outside one and line up a series of meshes as an outside "ring" of sorts.
<br /><br />Keep it up.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p176911" date="Posted: Fri Apr 27, 2007 8:37 am "><author>mfh1900</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I ve got three new screens:

The 2 panel ceiling texture and the walls look very plain.  As well, you have a light in that picture with no apparent light source.
<br /><br />Try to match all lighting with some brushwork/light models.  These and other small things seem like tedium, but collectively, if they aren't done, it really throws off a person's perception of the map because it doesn't follow our built in expectations of seeing a light source when there is a lighting change.  As well, seeing a single texture tiled to heck down a long wall.  Most architects wouldn't have long plain walls and neither should d3/q4 level designers.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p176970" date="Posted: Sat Apr 28, 2007 12:32 am "><author>vinnie_jones</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">as soon as i get my replacement 7600gt im gonna try this, looks cool, stairs or no stairs  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081117071452im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081117071452im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p176987" date="Posted: Sat Apr 28, 2007 11:49 am "><author>mfh1900</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Infernal=WFR wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">The left most image of that circular hallway.
