Carmacks original shader just was slightly faster and yielded a slight slight visual increase, so there wasn't that much of a difference you guys did a good job. The speed boost/quality increase came from increasing the clip level size to 2048, and instead of having a levelsizexlevelsize texture for each level, I switched it over to one texture and uploaded the miplevels required for each miplevel, rather than the old implementation for uploading the entire level(even though it technically was 1/4 size of the original but it still filled up the entire texture space), and than the old code generated mipmaps on the fly which obviously had to go.<br /><br />That mixed with dxt5 compression and realtime lighting makes megatextures usable. Stencil shadows just obviously have to go which I'm pretty close to finishing up the tutorial on.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p243961" date="Posted: Mon Nov 05, 2012 7:45 am "><author>Tron</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">It's amazing progress you've made, potential for some really nice looking terrain now.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p243822" date="Posted: Fri Nov 02, 2012 5:55 am "><author>jmarshall23</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">			<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319220828/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/download/file.php?id=886&amp;mode=view"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319220828im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/download/file.php?id=886&amp;t=1" alt="megatexture_r3_1.png" /></a><br /><span class="gensmall">megatexture_r3_1.png [ 1.27 MB | Viewed 434 times ]</span>

Carmacks original shader just was slightly faster and yielded a slight slight visual increase, so there wasn't that much of a difference you guys did a good job. The speed boost/quality increase came from increasing the clip level size to 2048, and instead of having a levelsizexlevelsize texture for each level, I switched it over to one texture and uploaded the miplevels required for each miplevel, rather than the old implementation for uploading the entire level(even though it technically was 1/4 size of the original but it still filled up the entire texture space), and than the old code generated mipmaps on the fly which obviously had to go.<br /><br />That mixed with dxt5 compression and realtime lighting makes megatextures usable. Stencil shadows just obviously have to go which I'm pretty close to finishing up the tutorial on.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p243961" date="Posted: Mon Nov 05, 2012 7:45 am "><author>Tron</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">It's amazing progress you've made, potential for some really nice looking terrain now.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p243822" date="Posted: Fri Nov 02, 2012 5:55 am "><author>jmarshall23</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">			<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319220828/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/download/file.php?id=886&amp;mode=view"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319220828im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/download/file.php?id=886&amp;t=1" alt="megatexture_r3_1.png" /></a><br /><span class="gensmall">megatexture_r3_1.png [ 1.27 MB | Viewed 434 times ]</span>

To install drag and drop into your doom 3 folder, this is fully compatible with Sikkmod. <br /><br />Features:<br /><ul>MegaTexture clip levels are now 2048(was 512), which allows for the detail required for Quake Wars terrain dimensions. The surrounding pixels around the player will be way more detailed, as evident in the screenshots. <br />The old code blitted each clip level to different texture, and in realtime generated the mipmaps for those levels. The new code blits to ONE texture and blits each clip level to that textures mipmap. Which gives a huge speed boost required for blitting 2048x2048 clip levels.<br />Megatexture's can now have realtime lightning and bump mapping on them.<br />MegaGen now generates mega local maps(specular is in the r channel, and the local r channel is in the alpha). <br />Speed up megagen by 10%. <br />MegaLevel's are now stored in seperate files a long with the clipmap.<br />No longer based off the Tron's/AO's megatexture shader, but rather based off of the megatexture shader in the bfg edition. <br /></ul><br />BUGS:<br /><ul>There is a bug were the stuff that is far far far far away renders black, I just noticed it now I'll fix it in the next release.<br />Terrain self shadowing looks horrible because of stencil shadows I'll drop in shadow mapping from idtech 4 cdk when I can.<br /></ul><br />Building a megatexture<br /><ul>Edit or create your own megaproject(look at the sample for how to setup the project).<br />Run Doom 3 open the console and type megagen &lt;megaproject&gt; you build your megaraw and megalocal files.<br />makemegatexture &lt;megaproject&gt;<br /><br />Time to build a megatexture, makemegatexture takes my computer about 7 minutes and megagen takes about 6 for a 32768x32768 megatexture.<br /></ul></div>]]></body></post><post id="p243831" date="Posted: Fri Nov 02, 2012 3:19 pm "><author>jmarshall23</author><body><![CDATA[<div

Perhaps, I'll feel differently once I drop my 8800 for something faster although I'll probably just end up with a 560 so no idea if even that would be good enough. Keeping in mind that anything using CDK will likely be at least a year after your first solid release so by then most people should have pretty good hardware anyway.<br /><br />I just...

Carmacks original shader just was slightly faster and yielded a slight slight visual increase, so there wasn't that much of a difference you guys did a good job. The speed boost/quality increase came from increasing the clip level size to 2048, and instead of having a levelsizexlevelsize texture for each level, I switched it over to one texture and uploaded the miplevels required for each miplevel, rather than the old implementation for uploading the entire level(even though it technically was 1/4 size of the original but it still filled up the entire texture space), and than the old code generated mipmaps on the fly which obviously had to go.<br /><br />That mixed with dxt5 compression and realtime lighting makes megatextures usable. Stencil shadows just obviously have to go which I'm pretty close to finishing up the tutorial on.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p243961" date="Posted: Mon Nov 05, 2012 7:45 am "><author>Tron</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">It's amazing progress you've made, potential for some really nice looking terrain now.</div>]]></body></post></posts></thread></xml>
