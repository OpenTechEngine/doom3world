<br /><br /><span style="color: red"><span style="font-weight: bold">Teleporting</span></span>
<br /><br /><span style="color: olive">I am going to explain this in text, as once again, I have respect towards 56k'ers.</span>
<br /><br /><br /><span style="color: red"><span style="font-weight: bold">Prerequisets:</span></span>
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">This requires previous expierences with basic tasks, e.g. creating a boxed map.</div><br /><br /><span style="color: red"><span style="font-weight: bold">Starting off:</span></span><br /><span style="color: olive"><br />What we are going to do is add an <span style="font-style: italic">info_player_teleport</span>, place this where you will like to teleport to.</span><br /><br /><span style="color: red"><span style="font-weight: bold">Explain Info_Player_Teleport Entity</span></span><br /><span style="color: olive"><br />Within the entity options of info_player_teleport are the two options <span style="font-style: italic">VisualView</span> and <span style="font-style: italic">VisualEffect</span>.<br /><br />These names are quite off, as they can be summarized really easily.</span><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">VisualView:<br />This acts as a 1st person view from a third-source target, e.g, a camera.<br /></div><br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">VisualEffect:<br />This is how long you will stay in position of [i]VisualView[/i], or how long you will be looking from the third-source targets point of view.<br /></div>
<br /><br /><span style="color: olive"><br />We are going to add a visualview to our <span style="font-style: italic">info_player_teleport</span>, but to do so, we are going to have to add a few other objects beforehand.<br /><br />First add a <span style="font-style: italic">func_cameraview</span>, give it a name like, "TelView". This will be our camera, position this where you would like the camera to be.<br /><br />Next add a <span style="font-style: italic">target_null</span>. This will act as a point of where our camera will  be facing, or looking into.<br /></span>
<br /><br /><span style="color: red"><span style="font-weight: bold">Final Touches</span></span>
<br /><span style="color: olive">Now we are just going to connect entities.</span>
<br /><br /><br /><span style="color: red"><span style="font-style: italic">First entity</span></span>
<br /><span style="color: olive">We will create a <span style="font-style: italic">trigger_multiple</span> [Thanks Swelt] and connect it with the info_player_teleport.<br />Use <span style="font-weight: bold">Control-K or Selection-&gt;Connect Entities</span></span>
<br /><br /><span style="color: red"><span style="font-style: italic">Second entity</span></span>
<br /><span style="color: olive">We will now connect func_cameraview and target_null.<br /></span>
<br /><span style="color: red"><span style="font-style: italic">Final Touch</span></span>
<br /><span style="color: olive">Remember <span style="font-style: italic">info_player_teleport's VisualView</span> and <span style="font-style: italic">VisualEffect</span>? Well, for the value of visualview plugin the name of func_cameraview, and under visualeffect, plugin the time for how long you wish to stay in position of the camera.</span>
<br /><span style="color: green"><br />That is all, just run the trigger and watch the magic happen.</span></div>]]></body></post><post id="p51027" date="Posted: Fri Sep 17, 2004 8:58 am "><author>swelt</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">trigger_multiple rather than trigger_once.

<br /><br />If you don't specify a visualEffect or a visualView it will be 'instant'.
<br /><br />But otherwise, yes, a 0 visualEffect would make sense to be instant.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p51114" date="Posted: Fri Sep 17, 2004 3:30 pm "><author>swelt</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Fair enough.

It's not essential, but there are possibilities there to do something else.
<br /><br />No idea what you've done to your map to stop it loading.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p54277" date="Posted: Thu Sep 30, 2004 1:39 pm "><author>just1n</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">evilartist wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Is there something I'm supposed to know before reading this tutorial or is my brain going crazy?

<br /><br />My tutorial would not do anything to your map.
<br /><br />Open it up in a text editor and remove the first entity.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p54287" date="Posted: Thu Sep 30, 2004 3:09 pm "><author>evilartist</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">How do you do the screaming intestine cut scene when teleporting?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p54363" date="Posted: Thu Sep 30, 2004 9:47 pm "><author>just1n</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Go into one of the Delta levels and copy the func_static, you will see it is just a huge oval shaped static object.
<br /><br />Place a fuc_cameraview inside the func_static. Then create a target_null, the position where it will point will be this.

<br /><br />1. create box the size of the trigger you want to use as a relay..
<br />  ie.. multiplayer texture and make sure its a multiplayer trigger
<br />  not a worldspawn when you deselect
<br /><br />2. create info_player_teleport  at area to teleport to
<br /><br />3. 1 select multiplayer trigger first
<br />4. 2 then info player teleport
<br />5 hit ctrl + k
<br />6 done</div>]]></body></post><post id="p136808" date="Posted: Wed Mar 15, 2006 9:46 pm "><author>Atwistedmind</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">or exit doom and restart... that always works for me, Its an age old problem...</div>]]></body></post><post id="p136883" date="Posted: Thu Mar 16, 2006 9:37 am "><author>gav89</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thnks mate it worked. I also tried experimenting with other stuff and found out you can get a GUI to set it off. What I did was I created a brush then I chose the model models/mapobjects/guiobjects/techdrpanel1/techdrpanel1.lwo and then I chose any GUI and finally I linked it to the teleporter and now you can use the GUI to activate the teleporter pretty cool. and again thnks the most simplest solution staring me in the face. The simple thick idiot thing of if in doubt switch off then on.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p179252" date="Posted: Tue May 29, 2007 1:29 am "><author>Sol342</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I'm new to DOOMEdit but i have worked a map for over 20 hours on this map ...
