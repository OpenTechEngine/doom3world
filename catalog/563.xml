<br /><br />Here are all the surce files you need:
<br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080418195836/http://www.doom3world.org/doom3/files/renderbumpflat.zip" class="postlink">Souce file download - 110kb</a>
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">The download contains:</span>
<br />- a simple 3D modelled panel with approx 11k polys
<br />- a material file for it to spare you writing one of your own
<br />- a grey tga texture I usually use for specular map testing
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Now let's go with step 1:</span>
<br />Create a folder structure below the base folder:
<br />bna/panels/
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Step 2:</span>
<br />Unzip the contents of the file in the panels folder and move the "bna.mtr" to the materials folder in your Doom directory - the rest will sit happy where it is now.
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Step 3:</span>
<br />Open Doom, lower the console and type:
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">renderbumpflat bna/panels/panel_3_trip.lwo</div><br /><br />Doom will load the 3D file "panel_3_trip.lwo" into memory and renderbump it with the default settings, which will leave you with two 256 * 256 .tga's :<br /><br />A normal map named:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">panel_3_trip_local.tga</div><br /><br />And a diffuse map named:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">panel_3_trip_color.tga</div>
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Now what happened?</span>
<br /><br />The Doom engine took the model, extracted the color information from the polygons and rendered it to a flat color map (which will look even more unimpressive as the underlying 3D model used).
<br /><br />At the same time the engine computed the surface normals in our newly toy - the beloved fancy looking normal map.
<br /><br />When you open up DoomEd and go to the media browser you should find a folder called "bna" and a subfolder called "panels" with one material called "panel_3_flat" in it.
<br />Make a brush, apply the texture, compile the map and see how it's looking.
<br />Well, not overly exciting I know, but you've successfully accomplished the task of rendering a 3D model into a flat texture <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080418195836im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />So far so good.
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What are the common pitfalls?</span>
<br /><br />1st:
<br />The 3D model has face towards the Z - axis (= looking at you in a front view camera perspective) in your 3D mesh modelling program of choice when you save it.
<br /><br />2nd:
<br />Make sure you have converted all your polygons into triangles (watch out for these little 1 and 2 vertex polygons)
<br /><br />3rd:
<br />I had some problems when I did set up a UV map, but don't quote me on that.
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What else can you do?</span>
<br /><br />The most important thing is the ability change the resolution of the rendered images.
<br /><br />When you type "renderbumpflat <span style="font-weight: bold">-size 1024 1024</span> yourmodelfile" you'll get a 1024*1024 resolution image which may be a better source file for building a texture upon it.
<br /><br />For other options just type "renderbumpflat" and Doom will show you the common use of the command with additional options.
<br /><br />Have fun and leave your questions here...</div>]]></body></post><post id="p4004" date="Posted: Mon Jan 27, 2003 3:35 am "><author>sic1</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Another quality tutorial from the man, BNA!

<br /><br />Thanks - I hope you like the results...
<br /><br />I've created a second set of files for testing:
<br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080418195836/http://www.doom3world.org/doom3/files/renderbumpflat1_additional.zip" class="postlink">Download - 1.18 mb</a>
<br /><br />This one contains a slightly modified model and a nice material I've created from the renderbumpflat result (to be honest - only the normal map got used).
<br /><br />I'd like to credit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080418195836/http://www.newtek.com/" class="postlink">NEWTEK</a> for their free texture set I used to create the base texture for this model.
<br /><br />Have fun with it!
<br /><br />Here's a render out of <span style="font-weight: bold">Lightwave</span> how this could look like when used in a realtime environment:

<br /><br />Thanks.
<br /><br />Renderbump:
<br /><br />That's the process to generate a normal map from a high poly object and project it on the UV map of a low poly object.
<br />You need a low poly object with a propperly set up UV map and the corresponding material shader.
<br />In the material shader you specify the renderbump settings like image size, trace grid, clormap switch, aa (anti aliasing?), image file name and of course the path to the high poly model.
<br /><br />Generally speaking that's the magic process of baking surface details to a considerably less detailed surface for later per pixel lighting.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p4733" date="Posted: Sun Feb 23, 2003 8:16 am "><author>supposetobeamapper</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">thanks, I conjectured that it should be something like this and I hoped that you would explain me how to use it  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080418195836im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> .

Now the model will act as a virtual spacer around your model. If the "frame" of your model is flat anyway, you can flip the spacer poly to look towards the cam.<br />This is also very handy for rendering things that aren't in 1x2 or 2x2 proportions. You can simply cut the resulting normals in photoshop and layer them with what you want.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Additionaly d3 has a strange display error when it´s done with the renderbumpflat, so i have to restart it every time <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080418195836im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_cry.gif" alt=":cry:" title="Crying or Very sad" /><br /><br />I´m using .ase objects, since i´m a 3dsmax user; could that be the problem??</div>
<br /><br />You're not alone - I've heard from other MAX users that they have .ase problems.

<br /><br />Got it - no problems with it.
<br /><br />I should mention that I always have Doom running windowed when performing renderbumpflat tasks.
<br /><br />The console usually disappears while rendering and comes back when the tga's are written to your hdd.
<br />Sometimes the window Doom is running in does not resize from the resolution chosen for the renderbumpflat images, but that's the only display error I've ever recieved.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p7066" date="Posted: Fri May 02, 2003 3:42 pm "><author>DeaDite</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">i made a human model in LW to test renderbump/renderbumpflat

<br />This method you use when you attempt to render panels or other halfway flat models.
<br /><br />Renderbump is something completely different - there you have to set up a UV map for your low poly model and accompany the surface with a proper material shader and a high poly model.
<br /><br />Talking about two methods in one sentence doesn't help with trouble shooting, especially when you don't say what you've been trying to do.
<br /><br />Did you try to create a skin for a model?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p7074" date="Posted: Fri May 02, 2003 5:58 pm "><author>rich_is_bored</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">This is apparently the closest thing to a renderbump tutorial on the forum.

<br /><br />I would be willing to write up a quick tutorial on the steps involved but I am not quite as knowledgable in texturing.
