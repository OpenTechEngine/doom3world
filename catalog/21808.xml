That's the issue with that, bloom is something else.  I have 8.5 drivers, haven't found a need to get a new version yet.

And it is, in my case...<br /><br />Ah, before I install fresh OS (especially in the cases when I'm switching video cards) I usually format c partition, so it’s clean and it can’t be cleaner than that… <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203055743im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /><br /><br />As for that question for Doom 3 installation, well… all my games I usually install on d. I see now that this Doom 3 I didn’t installed after my last OS installation, so I might do that. However I really doubt that this move will change anything, since if I remember correct I was do that twice on my previous windows and I had a same manifestation in a both cases and now also the same, but ok… I’ll do that so that I can eliminate that possibility…  Also, when I already need to do that,  well I'm thinking to make some tests, first with Doom3 1.0, then with 1.2 and 1.3 patched variation and then I’ll see what will happens…  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203055743im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_idea.gif" alt=":idea:" title="Idea" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p203625" date="Posted: Wed Aug 13, 2008 1:38 pm "><author>The Happy Friar</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I don't re-install my D3 with new OS installs eigther, in my base I just but some maps.

Well, each mod I’m placing in separate folder to avoid that possibility… So it’s hard that something like that can happens, however  for some mods I believe that is better to place them in original base folder with other regular Doom3 files… So it can be that solution for this problem is in that method… But as I said, I’ll make fresh installation (didn’t do that yet, since I was busy today) and then if that can’t handle my problem (and I really doubt that it will), I’ll try to place certain pk4 files directly in the base folder with the rest of other regular and see what will happen then…  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203055743im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_arrow.gif" alt=":arrow:" title="Arrow" />  (personal note: don't know what else I could try)... <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203055743im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p202707" date="Posted: Sun Jul 27, 2008 5:28 pm "><author>Vladimir</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Just wonder is there any fully operational HDR bloom mod for ATi graphic cards?<br /><br />I was recently get ATi 3870 and yesterday, after I was decided to bring back on my machine Doom 3 again, I was realized that I'm not capable to run not just even one variation of this Brillant Bloom mod with my current graphic card (and I have dozen of them) and many others won't work too (game patched with latest patch 1.3.1)..

That's the issue with that, bloom is something else.  I have 8.5 drivers, haven't found a need to get a new version yet.  You need to set the r_customheight to your screen height, r_customwidth to your screen width, r_aspectratio to to 0, 1 or 2 (1= 4:3, 1 = 16:9, 2 = 16:10, most WS monitors, NOT TV's), r_mode to -1 &amp; then do a vid_restart.<br /><br />should work just fine then.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p203601" date="Posted: Tue Aug 12, 2008 7:28 pm "><author>Vladimir</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Well, I didn’t check that FMJ mod, but I’ll do that for sure…<br /><br />I mean, perhaps it’ll work, since I’m heaving two different things in two different mods!<br /><br />As for your question about part of code which I’m using, well here it is, but I doubt that you’ll find here something unusual…<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">seta com_allowconsole "1"<br /><br />seta r_customHeight "1050"<br />seta r_customWidth "1680"<br />seta r_mode "-1"<br />seta r_aspectRatio "2" <br />seta g_fov "90"<br /><br />/// And graphics setting is:<br /><br />seta r_multiSamples "0"<br />seta image_downSizeLimit "256"<br />seta image_ignoreHighQuality "0"<br />seta image_downSizeBumpLimit "256"<br />seta image_downSizeSpecularLimit "64"<br />seta image_downSizeBump "0"<br />seta image_downSizeSpecular "0"<br />seta image_useCache "0"<br />seta image_cacheMegs "128"<br />seta image_cacheMinK "16000"<br />seta image_usePrecompressedTextures "0"<br />seta image_useNormalCompression "0"<br />seta image_useAllFormats "1"<br />seta image_useCompression "0"<br />seta image_preload "1"<br />seta image_roundDown "0"<br />seta image_forceDownSize "0"<br />seta image_downSize "0"<br />seta image_lodbias "0"<br />seta image_anisotropy "8"<br />seta image_filter "GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR"</div><br /><br />Oh, and btw, I have intel dual core but not AMD chip set, so...<br /><br />[EDIT] <br /><br />And trust me on this one, additional textures doesn't have anything at all with this problem...</div>]]></body></post><post id="p203604" date="Posted: Tue Aug 12, 2008 8:17 pm "><author>Vladimir</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Well, I was checked FMJ mod a couple of minutes ago and it seems that it works fine...

I see now that this Doom 3 I didn’t installed after my last OS installation, so I might do that.

Well, each mod I’m placing in separate folder to avoid that possibility… So it’s hard that something like that can happens, however  for some mods I believe that is better to place them in original base folder with other regular Doom3 files… So it can be that solution for this problem is in that method… But as I said, I’ll make fresh installation (didn’t do that yet, since I was busy today) and then if that can’t handle my problem (and I really doubt that it will), I’ll try to place certain pk4 files directly in the base folder with the rest of other regular and see what will happen then…  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203055332im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_arrow.gif" alt=":arrow:" title="Arrow" />  (personal note: don't know what else I could try)... <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203055332im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /></div>]]></body></post></posts></thread></xml>
