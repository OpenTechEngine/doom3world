I was wondering if anyone knew a way to use global hotkeys in doom3, such as Winamp.  Actually, the primary reason I want to know is to change the volume of the game.  I use a program called 'Sound Volume Hotkeys' that enables me to press a few buttons anywhere and the windows master volume will change.  This helps  a lot when I'm wearing headphones, because I'm constantly adjusting the volume (especially while in games).  This program works in 90% of all the games I've tried, but I've found that it does not work in Doom 3.  I've also tried other volume programs in windows, but with no luck.  I noticed that the global hotkeys in Winamp do not work either.  I guess Doom 3 overrides them all.  It's annoying having to press escape and change the volume through the Doom 3 menu every time.  Is there another way?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p207462" date="Posted: Tue Nov 11, 2008 8:14 pm "><author>Neurological</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I think is possible to bind a key to the cvar of the menu volume, so you just press F1 for example to lower the volume and F2 to raise it.

What hotkey program?  Also, what video mode do you run Doom 3 in?  It might be one of those factors.  I use Windows XP with the "Sound Volume Hotkeys" program.  Winamp doesn't work either, though...</div>]]></body></post><post id="p207518" date="Posted: Thu Nov 13, 2008 3:54 am "><author>The Happy Friar</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">i use XP Pro SP3.

Hotkeys work in every other game for me.  They only don't work in Doom 3.  You didn't tell me what volume hotkey program you use.  Or does your keyboard have volume buttons on it?  My kb does not have those.  I have to assign keys to the volume control using a 3rd party program.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p207521" date="Posted: Thu Nov 13, 2008 6:01 am "><author>The Happy Friar</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">my kb has the hotkeys right on it.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p207522" date="Posted: Thu Nov 13, 2008 6:51 am "><author>Lightning Hunter</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">The Happy Friar wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">my kb has the hotkeys right on it.</div><br /><br />Right.  That's what I thought...  My kb doesn't have them.  I'll bet no other global hotkeys work for you (Winamp especially).  I think it's because Doom overrides all the hotkeys.  However, since you can't bind volume keys on your kb to anything in Doom, they still work.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p207523" date="Posted: Thu Nov 13, 2008 6:57 am "><author>6th Venom</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">The Happy Friar wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">i use XP Pro SP3.
