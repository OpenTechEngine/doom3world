The name of your mesh object is not relevant and doesn't need to have the name of a bone. How you control the relationship between the mesh and the bones leads to the next question.<br /><div class="quotetitle">Doomguy87 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">ok when i attached and animated my gun looked like it melted and the slide doesnt slide, it crumples up. i have no clue wat cuased this <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121035831im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /></div><br />That apparently was the "skinning" assignment that got made automatically when you attached the gun geometry to the already skinned object. The word "skinning" is not texturing in this context, but defining the relationship between the mesh and the bones, it controls for every vertex which bones are having an influence on this vertex when they move. Some keywords to look for when you search for tutorials on the web or in 3dsmax help is "skin modifier" and "deformation", also look for "rigid" skinning because the gun shouldn't behave like skin on a skeleton but like a rigid, inflexible body, which means a vertex is not influenced by more than one bone, and all vertices in a rigid part of your gun are influenced by the same bone. If you want to animate parts of your gun that were not there in the original skeleton, you will have to create new bones and ofcourse you'll have to export new animations for that changed skeleton.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p205645" date="Posted: Thu Oct 02, 2008 9:05 pm "><author>Doomguy87</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">ok i imported the pistolview.md5mesh and i replaced the gun with mine and did some wieght painting. then i went to export and i used ur exporter der_ton (MD5.MAX.Exporter.For.Skin.Modifier.mzp) . i chose to export both (mesh and anim) and then added the viewpistol mesh and i got and error saying "Unknown property: "Name" in undefined. this was the highlighted text in the error log:  if ((findBoneByName boneList b.name) != 0) or (b == rootBone) do. then when i imported my model the first time it said "Error: tried to load deleted object". so i deleted that md5 mesh, exported another and the same export error, only when i import this model, no error but nothing is there after import. can u help, u know more about ur importer\exporter than i do.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121035831im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" />  btw thanks for putting up with me.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121035831im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p205713" date="Posted: Sun Oct 05, 2008 2:24 am "><author>Doomguy87</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">nvm, i found ur better importer, guess i jumped the gun a little, thanks all for the help,. i may be back for other problems on getting it in game but so far im good, thanks a bunch  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121035831im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121035831im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121035831im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p205715" date="Posted: Sun Oct 05, 2008 3:25 am "><author>Doomguy87</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">ok model is in game but its all black, so was i supposed to texture this thing before i put it ingame?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p205716" date="Posted: Sun Oct 05, 2008 3:55 am "><author>Neurological</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">before you attach the new weapon to the hands mesh you have to uvmap and texture the model.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p205717" date="Posted: Sun Oct 05, 2008 4:07 am "><author>Doomguy87</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">AHHHH PISS, thank u i'll give 'er another go. i do want to keep the same textures as the pistol, so do i just uvw map or do i have to give it a custom texture?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p205719" date="Posted: Sun Oct 05, 2008 5:58 am "><author>Doomguy87</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">ok gun is textured but its transparent. might have something to do with UVW mapping, but i dont want it all fucked up, but i'll give it a shot.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p205723" date="Posted: Sun Oct 05, 2008 10:22 am "><author>der_ton</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">It is probably a problem with your material declaration. If you are using the same material on the pistol as the vanilla game pistol, then the shader in the md5mesh file should be the same. After exporting the .md5mesh file, open it with a text editor and search for the lines with the "shader" keyword. Do the same with the vanilla pistol md5mesh file and check if something is wrong.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p205734" date="Posted: Sun Oct 05, 2008 6:51 pm "><author>Doomguy87</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">yea the i should make an .mtr decl with the pistol textures and keep the ones from the mesh i made the same, cuz when i looked at the text the pistols shader was: models\weapons\pistol (something like that, i cant remeber exactly but it was the default). also i replaced the vanilla pistol directly.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p205745" date="Posted: Mon Oct 06, 2008 12:11 am "><author>Neurological</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">if you replaced the pistol directly you should have also another shader of the new weapon.
