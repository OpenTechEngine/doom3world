<br/><br/>
yes, it's a barrel lights mod for the weapons, but with a little more...class, i would say, instead of the simplistic ones that have been created.  Of course the solution to my problem is not one I can find easily unless someone (other than myself who actually knows what they're doing) were to actually look at what i've done.  &#13;
<br/><br/>
The Mod:&#13;
<br/><a href="/web/20061013054634/http://www.wayoftheleaf.net/download/BarrelLights.zip" target="_blank" class="postlink">http://www.wayoftheleaf.net/download/BarrelLights.zip</a>&#13;
<br/>
This is just the current pk4, and gamedll for my mod, that will do the barrel lights as i've designed them.  if this is all you need wonderful, because it is 3.5 meg.  (you'll need to access the game options menu to activate the lights for all the weapons)&#13;
<br/><br/>
The problem exists in the fact that when I turn on the light for the mod, the projected "circle of light" the actual "flashlight" appears fine in 1st person mode for all the guns.  However, if you toggle to 3rd person, you'll find that very same circular projection is only visible for the chaingun and the flashlight.  I don't know why.  I don't know how.  Yes, i am pathetic, and cannot figure out what the difference is between my models.  I di the same thing for all of them, imported them the same, attached my mesh the same, linked the bones the same, names, textures, yadda yadda yadda.  it just doesn't work.  &#13;
<br/><br/>
tragically, that may not be enough, so at this link:&#13;
<br/><a href="/web/20061013054634/http://www.wayoftheleaf.net/download/max.zip" target="_blank" class="postlink">http://www.wayoftheleaf.net/download/max.zip</a>&#13;
<br/>
Is all my 3dsMax 7 files that I used to create these models, but tragically it is 11 meg, which means I don't expect much.&#13;
<br/><br/>
I know this is probably the most humiliating request for help, but I'm out of options save submitting a flawed mod (imho).  (yes, i am a perfectionist)&#13;
<br/><br/>
If anyone takes pity on me, and is willing to look at this to see what might be causing the discrepancy between the world models that prevents all save the chaingun from projecting the actual texture, I would be most appreciative.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Thanks&#13;

Do you mean the bone is too far inside the model, so the lightsource attached to it isn't able to project beyond the boundary of the model?&#13;
<br/><br/>
That would be strange but i'll look into it.&#13;

<br/><br/>
okay, that is strange...  ohbib, i tried what I thought you meant by the lightsource being inside the mesh, so I edited my world model, moving the bone up as close to the front of the barrel mesh as possible.  &#13;
<br/><br/>
An strangely enough it worked...partially.  Basically, if you look at the shotgun world mesh, there are a few testure panes in front of the barrel, for the muzzleflash animations.  Below the actual barrel, is another cylinder that looks like barrel, but is probably supposed to be the ammo/clip housing to hold the extra shells.  I placed my bone to the end of that lower cylinder, with a bulb texture on the front of it, a flare texture little further away (hovering in space) and the beam texture going right through the barrel stretching forward.&#13;
<br/><br/><img src="/web/20061013054634im_/http://www.wayoftheleaf.net/download/sgw.jpg" border="0"/><br/>
(You can see the bone here protuding towards the screen, and the little bulb texture at the edge of the barrel, and the beam texture extending outward from the bone)&#13;
<br/><br/>
Now, I tested this, since the bone was originally further back into that cylinder, but with it as it is in the above image, I got a partial view of the flashlight in 3rd person view, but it was cut in half (vertically).&#13;
<br/><img src="/web/20061013054634im_/http://www.wayoftheleaf.net/download/sgw_screen.jpg" border="0"/><br/><br/>
Any suggestions as to why the "hidden" mesh/textures are doing that to the final light?&#13;
<br/>

I just can't say for sure though, but it has to be some mesh there is blocking the light partially. That's what it looks like to me in your screenshot.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="/web/20061013054634/http://home.telkomsa.net/obihb" target="_blank" class="postlink">Obi-Wan</a></span><span class="gensmall"/></td>
