For those of you who have been keeping track, this is # 7 in the series. It's one big con is that it's not gory anymore. Mortal Kombat was gory from the very beginning and now that they added the DC characters, they can't show the gore anymore, I guess some pissy little kids will make like a banana and shit when the see Sub-Zero rip Superman's spine out. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081113012435im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />  Other than that, it looks great.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p207081" date="Posted: Mon Nov 03, 2008 7:09 am "><author>rich_is_bored</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I haven't kept up with the series much. I played the first 3 pretty adamantly.<br /><br />Not too long ago I tried playing MK Armageddon and it felt like a completely different game. I'm not sure it survived the transition to 3D.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p207105" date="Posted: Mon Nov 03, 2008 8:34 pm "><author>Zenix</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I was really pissed off at the Teen rating.. I know games don't need blood/gore, but for Mortal Kombat this was one of it's biggest selling points. I was planning on ignoring the game, then the screenshots and videos released looked pretty good. Then they released the Joker fatality, which was just plain awesome... and then they removed the Joker fatality... so now I'm really going to be boycotting this one.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p207106" date="Posted: Mon Nov 03, 2008 9:39 pm "><author>Kristus</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">first 3 were great. <br />God of War is pwnzing Mortal Kombat now though.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p207108" date="Posted: Mon Nov 03, 2008 10:09 pm "><author>iceheart</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Mortal Kombat without gore?
