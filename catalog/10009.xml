<br />UPDATE 4/27/05
<br /><br />i'm going to get the zsecs to shoot at or run away from your grenades, retreat when their health gets low (and then ambush you when you catch up with them) and also run away from you when you have the chainsaw! <img src="/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />this movie shows the zsec shooting at grenades. it looks simple, but the scripting was not  <img src="/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_mad.gif" alt=":x" title="Mad" />. as dumb as they are, the zsec's have the most complicated ai scripts...

<br /><br />*********************************************************
<br /><br />this is probably nothing new to a lot of people around here, but something interesting nonetheless...
<br /><br />for sh*ts and giggles, i added this to the zsec's combat checks:
<br /><br />float zsec_health = self.getHealth();
<br />if ( zsec_health &lt;= 25 ) {
<br /> self.moveToCover();
<br /> sys.wait(10);
<br />}
<br /><br />so now when the going gets too tough for the poor little zsecs, they will retreat!
<br /><br />its functional as is, but it needs more tweeking. might be fun to add to your doom3 for more replay value...[/code]</div>]]></body></post><post id="p88963" date="Posted: Sun Apr 17, 2005 8:30 pm "><author>romperstomper</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">hmmm maybe you could make a similar one for the marine comrades? <img src="/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />  Theyre a tad too kamikaze as it is now  <img src="/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p88978" date="Posted: Sun Apr 17, 2005 9:58 pm "><author>Kristus</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">What marine comrades, there's no NPC marine friendlies in Doom3.
