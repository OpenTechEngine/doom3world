Everything in the editor is working, but when I use the 'J' key to open the light editor something strange happens; after I set my light parameters and close the light editor, if I run the game with F2 I will not be able to fire with the equipped weapon; instead light entities will have an in-game green bounding box (as they usually have when selected in the editor) and if I aim at them and click with LMB the game will close and send me back to QuakeEdit, with the light editor open. While in the background the grunt I placed in my small map brutally kills me. Any idea? Thank you in advance!<br /><br />Dario</div>]]></body></post><post id="p222924" date="Posted: Tue Mar 09, 2010 2:44 am "><author>Biohazard {ewz}</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">sounds like u were using editsounds and editlights. dont!!! if that doesnt work delete both ur editor.cfg and quakeconfig.cfg in both the base and ur mod folder.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p225127" date="Posted: Sat Jun 26, 2010 7:50 pm "><author>ctressle</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I don't know how to open/use "editsounds" and "editlights", unless editlights is the light editor upon hitting 'j' within the map editor.
