<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Linking to images in forum topics</span>
<br />When uploading images to your image host please remember that *.BMPs (bitmaps) do not work with this forum image tag code '[ img ][ /img ]'. 
<br /><br />You should preferably use a more web friendly image format like JPEG, GIF, or PNG as they take up less space and you can use them in image tags.
<br /><br />Also keep in mind images should be kept to 640 pixel width if linked to directly in a message (if the image actually appears), otherwise you can simply use text links to the relavent offsite page.
