If simple directions had been included with the download then I wouldn't be posting right now but there wasn't so I am.

Go ahead and flame me or something for creating a new topic on this but at least please respond with an answer.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157370" date="Posted: Sun Sep 17, 2006 11:43 am "><author>Rayne</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">hey take it easy man!
