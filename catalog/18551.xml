  <span style="font-weight: bold">I have had that happen in my maps aswell. a couple of obvious things could cause it ...first, I noticed that whenever that happened, it was iether where two brushes touched, or the invisibility was "projected" (in a way ) onto the wall behind. and the invisible wall (or partially invisible) was caused by a nearby light source.if you follow the angle of the missing texture, in various directions... it may lead you to the culprit .  Triangles develop in the map wheather we see them or not... a  light at certain angles to an inner corner , or some brushwork (ie: 2 brushes should be touching, and aren't) for instance. I made a piped radiator with 10 louvered pieces of metal plate on it high up on a wall, illuminated it with a light source, and it created some pretty awsome shadows.
