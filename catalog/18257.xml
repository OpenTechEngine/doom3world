I need to know a few essential things. What is the name of the object that ends a level in single player, normally in Dedit you just make a trigger and set the command to say msg LevelEnd and it will allow you to go onto the next level in the rotation. Also I would like to know how to make the character model Change to another model.
<br /><br />2.Add a skin to an AI, i am waaay new to the pk4 set up with things. 
<br /><br />3.Adding a new menu screen?? I know in Fear you just go into the GDB but this is waaay different.
<br /><br />4.How do i compile a mod so that people can just access it through say an exe or will they have to go into prey and choose mods.
<br /><br />Any help is verry appretiated.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p165981" date="Posted: Sat Dec 30, 2006 9:58 am "><author>rich_is_bored</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I'll give you a general idea of what's involved but I'm not going to elaborate because there's too much information to cover and you should be able work out the details once you know the terms to search for.
<br /><br />2. Find the entity declaration responcible for the actor for which you'd like to create a skin. Determine what model this actor uses. Determine what material shader is used by the model. Determine what image maps are used in the material shader. Create new images based on the originals. Write a new material shader based on the original. Write a skin declaration. Apply the skin to the actor either via key/value pairs.
<br /><br />3. Determine what gui is responcible for the main menu. Replace this file.
<br /><br />4. Create a shortcut or batch file to launch the prey executable with the fs_game command line parameter.
<br /><br />I would highly advise that you visit <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320003704/http://www.modwiki.net/">http://www.modwiki.net</a><!-- w --> and read as much as possible.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p165998" date="Posted: Sat Dec 30, 2006 6:09 pm "><author>Tman-42</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Ok thank you for linking me there.
