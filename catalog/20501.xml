This thread isn't pointless until e-penises start clashing.  Until then, there's no reason why a guy can't be curious about how his new pc compares to others.  In fact I'd like to compare notes as I have an almost identical system to him with the exception of the video card.  My 8800gts is the 320mb version, so it would be interesting to see how our scores differ.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p188476" date="Posted: Sat Sep 15, 2007 3:26 am "><author>Duff</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">i remember doing one of the old ones with a friend of mine, hes comp had double the score; which we expected. <br />it was still cool.<br /><br />i think my comp if i did a current one would have a negative score its so old school.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p188505" date="Posted: Sat Sep 15, 2007 3:17 pm "><author>mac</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">well if you would be really interested you could visit the website and browse through dozend configurations etc...<br /><br />at the end its not my descision what quality this board will end up.. i remeber times on here where actualy quality discussion took place.. not a teeny place to ramble over the same stuff over and over again.. but well.. since bna is fine with it.. why should i care.. gone one with youre score comparsion..</div>]]></body></post><post id="p188511" date="Posted: Sat Sep 15, 2007 6:14 pm "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">mac wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">at the end its not my descision what quality this board will end up.. i remeber times on here where actualy quality discussion took place.. not a teeny place to ramble over the same stuff over and over again.. but well.. since bna is fine with it.. why should i care.. gone one with youre score comparsion..</div><br /><br />Actually this is the general discussion forum section which serves the purpose to catch all topics which otherwise would add too much noise to the content focused categories.<br /><br />I personally don't care about 3D Mark scores. Everytime I build a new computer I run the usual tests to see wether everything runs within the typical range of a specific system configuration, but that's about it.<br /><br />Albeit it's "my" board it's at the same time meant to offer a discussion framework for the registered users, called community. If every 12 or 18 months a topic like this one pops up, then fine, why not. It's not like these topics make up for most of the content here.<br /><br />So I think we can agree the quality of D3W and all subsequent sites which will form around this board is not in danger because of one 3D mark post <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />But one thing is for sure - I wholeheartly appreciate your and anyone else concern to keep the quality up!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p188533" date="Posted: Sun Sep 16, 2007 9:20 am "><author>Final_Light</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Zombie13 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">mac wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">youre e-penis is soo huge, my friend.. but its a boring and pointless thread.. and actualy.. yours is kinda small.. look here<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.futuremark.com/community/halloffame/">http://www.futuremark.com/community/halloffame/</a><!-- m --></div><br /><br />One thing I've come to realise that not every one is over 50 years of age, there are some younger people who might take an interest in such things, while I agree it is what you mentioned.<br /><br />But never the less, give em a break eh <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div><br /><br />Well said.<br /><br />I guess that users here are not as interested in e-penis threads that much. I just thought it would be interesting to read what others had. Ill try my best to have more quality in my posts next time. sorry.</div>]]></body></post></posts></thread></xml>
