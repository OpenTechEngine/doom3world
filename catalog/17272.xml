<br /><br />thanks blackdog, and I could ul the model`s .blend file if you have blender or perhaps export it to a format your modeling app can use?
<br /><br />either way I would appreciate seeing how you or anyone else would do the seams on models like this, as I accept I`ve still things to learn with modeling <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205143835im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205143835/http://img215.imageshack.us/my.php?image=image423yk4.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205143835im_/http://img215.imageshack.us/img215/9100/image423yk4.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a></div>]]></body></post><post id="p157825" date="Posted: Fri Sep 22, 2006 9:52 pm "><author>Black Dog</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Sure, .blend is fine for me.

<br /><br />if there is any vertex colors like the black to white fades we use to control texture blends, then it changes the some of the white to greens or blues, which I can`t see where they are coming from since my rock texture and the d3 dirt I was using don`t appear to have either of those colors in them.
<br /><br />I also tested the "textures/common/collision" material on some of my .ase models and it doesn`t seem to clip the player or their weapon projectiles, but some of d3`s clip materials did work, also doing a window context search of the original d3 mapobjects resulted in only .lwo models to use the collision material.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157851" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 4:17 am "><author>Black Dog</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">"Native" exporters break all the time in blender.

After spending much more time wrestling with blender than pushing uvs, here we go:
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205143835/http://members.westnet.com.au/GeoffGole/temp/ratty_terrain05_03_REUNWRAPPED.blend">http://members.westnet.com.au/GeoffGole ... PPED.blend</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />I suggest that you append the object from this file rather than just opening the .blend, since it's not likely you want all my wierd settings. (Putting user interface settings in the same file as mesh data is pretty stupid). Some stuff has been ripped out to make it easier for me to work with the mesh, but don't worry about that - just take a look at the seam placement and uv layout.
<br /><br />First thing to notice is that I don't just use long, continuous seams but also some short one-ended cuts. That allows lcsm to push uvs over those seams, which helps relax stretching. In a few spots that results in mapping that is not 1 to 1, but that shouldn't be a problem when you are using an existing world texture (it's a big nono if your uvs will be used for baking/lightmapping/painting though, keep that in mind). I pushed those spots to where I thought they would be difficult to see - without knowing what your lighting and mesh position is going to be in game it's a bit difficult to know, so you'll want to make that kind of decision for yourself.
<br /><br />Secondly, the unwrapping here is pin-free and based entirely on the cuts that I've made. The only change is that the resulting uvset has been rotated and scaled a bit. If you want to play with the seam layout, just add more and unwrap again.
<br /><br />Lastly, if I was modelling this myself I'd give some thought to other methods of getting rid of seams. There's a big nasty one down the middle of the bottom of this mesh, maybe I'd move that one to where I know there'll be shadows or model a boulder to go on top of it. You pointed out yourself that you could arrange for seams to go where you've blended in the dirt texture, that would be worth looking at. You could also add another crack on the other side of the bridge, as those are perfect spots to hide seams.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157858" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 6:06 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">thanks black dog and this is very interesting <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205143835im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />firstly I didn`t know we could have seams that weren`t continuous edge loops. also great idea to hide the seams in cracks, I think I can do that quite easily from now on, and a few more beveled cracks will make the rocks look more interesting. and as you also suggested, covering them up with other models like boulders.
<br /><br />I might still use the odd pin, but I think your method will save me a lot of time in the future, as my uv maps were getting messed up a lot each time I added in more polys like the cracks, because the excessive pinning I was using was restricting the uv map from automatically shifting around while doing a lscm to compensate for the new polys uv`s.
<br /><br />so was this the first time you`ve used blender or was it just my .blend file that caused you problems? either way, I very much appreciate the time you spent on helping me with this <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205143835im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />did you know we can use the file browser and deselect the "load ui" button at the bottom of the file browser?
<br /><br />this means that each blender user can retain their user prefs but load in other users project data (mesh, textures, materials etc) although some of the global prefs, like the paths blender looks for textures, are saved into the .b.blend file. although even that can be backed up or over written with global prefs for different projects we might be working on.
<br /><br />I do agree though it did seem stupid at first that blender saves some user prefs into the .blend project files, but I`ve got used to it.
<br /><br />which is the main modeling app you use?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157864" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 7:08 am "><author>Black Dog</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I use blender extensively, but rather narrowly. In other words, I stick to a certain subset of features that I know very well and ignore the rest. Loading your .blend caused a few issues that I wasn't familiar with, so figuring them out took some time.
<br /><br />I did know that there was an option not to load the ui, just couldn't remember where the hell it was. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205143835im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I might still use the odd pin, but I think your method will save me a lot of time in the future, as my uv maps were getting messed up a lot each time I added in more polys like the cracks, because the excessive pinning I was using was restricting the uv map from automatically shifting around while doing a lscm to compensate for the new polys uv`s.</div>
<br /><br />That's the main disadvantage of pinning.

<br /><br />I`m now using blender more then any other editor, but every week I learn something new about it or realize the potential of a feature I vaguely knew about previously. if users can get past the very steep learning curve of its interface, then it`s amazing how feature packed it is, would you agree?
<br /><br />I`ll try to not use pinning for my world models, but at least it is something I can fall back on if I struggle with the seams.
<br /><br />am I right in thinking that as long as they are well placed and hidden we could have many seams on a model, especially the one ended type, and the result would still be neat looking uv map, so instead of adding in more pins as I have been doing I add in more seams, yes?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157914" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 8:22 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I haven`t done any of the new uv mapping, so this image is just of blender`s solid view mode, but it shows the rock bridge meshes spanning across the main cave.

<br /><br />Blender is certainly full of stuff to learn. The thing is, I have no need for most of it and I'm more interested in learning to make assets than learning Blender. My focus is entirely on modelling and unwrapping and as such dealing with the complexities of the rendering or materials systems just isn't appealing. Out of all the clever things that got added in 2.42, for instance, the only ones I have real use for are the uvlayout export (decent at last!) and the very useful merge to target vertex. Now they just need to make the knife tool snap to the grid.
<br /><br />While it's possible to have many seams on a model, I don't know that more is always better. The idea is simply to have the surface look as contiguous as possible without stretching, ideally using as few seams as possible. Learning how to do that effectively is really just a matter of unwrapping a few models and seeing what works.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157962" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 5:16 pm "><author>kit89</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Looking Good Ratty. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205143835im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />When it comes to UV-mapping in Blender I suggest you try the "Live UnWrap Transform" feature.

<br /><br />thanks kit89, and I had already been using "lscm live transform" which is a lot better then lscm on it`s own, if we intend to then tweak the uv`s by hand, but I now think black dog`s suggestion of first making more efficient seams on these game world models, will be the most time saving method, although I`ll still be using lscm live and pinning on non world models.
<br /><br />thinking about it, I`ll probably still use just a couple of pins on the game world models but only so I don`t have to scale, rotate and align the uv maps each time I use lscm to unwrap the model, but I don`t intend to tweak their uv`s by hand.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157991" date="Posted: Sun Sep 24, 2006 7:27 am "><author>kit89</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I'd suggest looking at this tutorial.

<br /><br />    and although I spent a lot of time on experimenting where to place the uv seams, I still ended up tweaking the uv map a lot which I haven`t had to do recently with the rock or terrain models.
<br /><br />    but while working on this hell cage I discovered the very useful "w key/align x or y" tool in the uv/image editor window. this ment I could quickly clean up the hell cage metal bars uv`s. so before I started bending them out of shape, I had a wip version where the uv`s were very neatly mapped to the polys with hardly any stretching, and after bending the bars I`m still very pleased with the uv map <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225084513im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />    hopefully the next one of these cages I build I`ll be able to model and uv map it a lot quicker.

A simple example, you need:
<br /><br />1. a Doom3 Material named
<br /><br />textures/base_wall/superpipes
<br /><br />2. a image for texturing in Blender, stored in the path
<br /><br />E:\Doom\base\textures\base_wall\superpipes.tga
<br /><br />3. in Blender a Material for your mesh with a Texture into which you load that image (once loaded you can select it in the UV editor)
<br /><br />If you export the model, you dont need to change the *BITMAP lines because it have a usable path doom3 can interpret as material. The only important thing is you have to store the image in the right path:

After spending much more time wrestling with blender than pushing uvs, here we go:

<br /><br />I suggest that you append the object from this file rather than just opening the .blend, since it's not likely you want all my wierd settings. (Putting user interface settings in the same file as mesh data is pretty stupid). Some stuff has been ripped out to make it easier for me to work with the mesh, but don't worry about that - just take a look at the seam placement and uv layout.
<br /><br />First thing to notice is that I don't just use long, continuous seams but also some short one-ended cuts. That allows lcsm to push uvs over those seams, which helps relax stretching. In a few spots that results in mapping that is not 1 to 1, but that shouldn't be a problem when you are using an existing world texture (it's a big nono if your uvs will be used for baking/lightmapping/painting though, keep that in mind). I pushed those spots to where I thought they would be difficult to see - without knowing what your lighting and mesh position is going to be in game it's a bit difficult to know, so you'll want to make that kind of decision for yourself.
<br /><br />Secondly, the unwrapping here is pin-free and based entirely on the cuts that I've made. The only change is that the resulting uvset has been rotated and scaled a bit. If you want to play with the seam layout, just add more and unwrap again.
<br /><br />Lastly, if I was modelling this myself I'd give some thought to other methods of getting rid of seams. There's a big nasty one down the middle of the bottom of this mesh, maybe I'd move that one to where I know there'll be shadows or model a boulder to go on top of it. You pointed out yourself that you could arrange for seams to go where you've blended in the dirt texture, that would be worth looking at. You could also add another crack on the other side of the bridge, as those are perfect spots to hide seams.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157858" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 7:06 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">thanks black dog and this is very interesting <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225083147im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />firstly I didn`t know we could have seams that weren`t continuous edge loops. also great idea to hide the seams in cracks, I think I can do that quite easily from now on, and a few more beveled cracks will make the rocks look more interesting. and as you also suggested, covering them up with other models like boulders.
<br /><br />I might still use the odd pin, but I think your method will save me a lot of time in the future, as my uv maps were getting messed up a lot each time I added in more polys like the cracks, because the excessive pinning I was using was restricting the uv map from automatically shifting around while doing a lscm to compensate for the new polys uv`s.
<br /><br />so was this the first time you`ve used blender or was it just my .blend file that caused you problems? either way, I very much appreciate the time you spent on helping me with this <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225083147im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />did you know we can use the file browser and deselect the "load ui" button at the bottom of the file browser?
<br /><br />this means that each blender user can retain their user prefs but load in other users project data (mesh, textures, materials etc) although some of the global prefs, like the paths blender looks for textures, are saved into the .b.blend file. although even that can be backed up or over written with global prefs for different projects we might be working on.
<br /><br />I do agree though it did seem stupid at first that blender saves some user prefs into the .blend project files, but I`ve got used to it.

<br /><br />I`ll try to not use pinning for my world models, but at least it is something I can fall back on if I struggle with the seams.
<br /><br />am I right in thinking that as long as they are well placed and hidden we could have many seams on a model, especially the one ended type, and the result would still be neat looking uv map, so instead of adding in more pins as I have been doing I add in more seams, yes?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157914" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 9:22 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I haven`t done any of the new uv mapping, so this image is just of blender`s solid view mode, but it shows the rock bridge meshes spanning across the main cave.

<br /><br />Blender is certainly full of stuff to learn. The thing is, I have no need for most of it and I'm more interested in learning to make assets than learning Blender. My focus is entirely on modelling and unwrapping and as such dealing with the complexities of the rendering or materials systems just isn't appealing. Out of all the clever things that got added in 2.42, for instance, the only ones I have real use for are the uvlayout export (decent at last!) and the very useful merge to target vertex. Now they just need to make the knife tool snap to the grid.
<br /><br />While it's possible to have many seams on a model, I don't know that more is always better. The idea is simply to have the surface look as contiguous as possible without stretching, ideally using as few seams as possible. Learning how to do that effectively is really just a matter of unwrapping a few models and seeing what works.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157962" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 6:16 pm "><author>kit89</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Looking Good Ratty. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225083147im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />When it comes to UV-mapping in Blender I suggest you try the "Live UnWrap Transform" feature.

<br /><br />I`m pleased with how it looks in blender, but for some reason the vertex colors aren`t working on this model when loaded into blender.
<br /><br />in d3 the "r_showvertexcolor 1" shows a pure white model but in blender the vertex color has the top faces of the rock white fading to black for the sides and bottom of the rock.
<br /><br />could it be something to do with the seams that are preventing this from working?

<br />    thanks and I`ll try a single seam up the back of the horns, I also thought about painting details onto the texture to fit within the exact shape of the horns rather then just use a wall like texture like they apparently did with the original d3 horns/saber teeth. and I`ve been vertex blending them into a rock or dirt texture which seems to work quite well, although the scale is a bit different since the rock models use a large scale on them then the rock base of the horns.
<br /><br />    thanks for the suggestion, but I don`t think I`ll try painting out the seems, although I`ve done that before on some of the d3 character models for my personal mod. it is very time consuming especially when editing the local, height and specular textures as well as the diffuse (color) texture, not that these horns use all those material stages but it`s low priority, as plan to spend as much time on building as many models as possible, as well as all the sp game play events I have in mind <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225083449im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p158133" date="Posted: Mon Sep 25, 2006 3:59 pm "><author>Black Dog</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"> one of the tasks I least enjoy when modeling my meshes is when I have two rows of verts I want to merge together along the seam, rather then all into the same vertex.

If things are nicely aligned axially, sometimes you can get away with using the scaling trick constrained to an axis and do the whole lot at once. Also if you are doing radial work, sometimes you can avoid having to handle each vertex on a curve with smart use of scaling around the cursor, which can get you close enough that remove doubles will finish the job.

<br /><br />    my conclusion is the beveled cracks to hide the uv seams on the undersides of the rock bridge and some of the floating rocks was a waste of polys, especially as the player couldn`t really see them in game unless they noclipped into the air, to get close enough to the undersides of those rocks.
<br /><br />    so when I got home from our long weekend, I merged the polys along either side of the uv seams, as well as redoing the seams and un wrapping for the first rocks I built.
<br /><br />    what I have done though is added in some beveled edges to the cracks the player is likely to see, as they are a better use of the polys I think.
<br /><br />    image shack seems slow today so I`ve only managed to ul one image so far, but will ul and post links to the finished rock bridge asap.

<br /><br />    I also ran the blender script "uv/image editor\uv menu\texture baker" to output a version of the original pentastic1.tga texture, so in psp7 I could fade to black the inner edges where the decal sits on top of the rock`s cracks.

<br /><br />here`s an older d3 test map I was working on last year, which might show more clearly my version of the d3 player skin, I`ve used the same dark grey and chrome theme for the d3xp version as well.

<br /><br />last week and today I got some more modeling done to the hell map, but I also spent another long weekend with my girlfriend, this time in her home town of milton keynes.
<br /><br />we`re now planning for me to move up there over the next couple of weeks, so I`m not sure how much of the hell map I`ll get done until I`m fully set up in her flat. although she does have broadband which will be a welcome upgrade from my 56k I`ve been using for years.
<br /><br />the hell map is at the top of my project list and it will definitely get released oneday, in the mean time I`ll do as much as I can to it when ever possible and keep you people here updated.
<br /><br />I do have a new technical issue I`d like help with.
<br /><br />in these screen images, your see I have built a tunnel entrance into the rock walls at the bottom of the main cave, with the lava flowing into the tunnel. but as the tunnel slopes downwards, I`m having difficulty with the lava fog lights as having two next to each other doesn`t look good in game, I assume because we can see the sides of the fog volume.
<br /><br />is there a way to simulate the fog following the contours of the lava or should I leave out the fog lights?

<br /><br />also various users have found different d3 paths work or don`t work for them, for me personally, I have all my .ase models use the "w:/doom/base/" prefix for the texture paths which works perfectly on my system, although I think kat uses one of the others.

<br /><br />    and although I spent a lot of time on experimenting where to place the uv seams, I still ended up tweaking the uv map a lot which I haven`t had to do recently with the rock or terrain models.
<br /><br />    but while working on this hell cage I discovered the very useful "w key/align x or y" tool in the uv/image editor window. this ment I could quickly clean up the hell cage metal bars uv`s. so before I started bending them out of shape, I had a wip version where the uv`s were very neatly mapped to the polys with hardly any stretching, and after bending the bars I`m still very pleased with the uv map <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225092400im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />    hopefully the next one of these cages I build I`ll be able to model and uv map it a lot quicker.

A simple example, you need:
<br /><br />1. a Doom3 Material named
<br /><br />textures/base_wall/superpipes
<br /><br />2. a image for texturing in Blender, stored in the path
<br /><br />E:\Doom\base\textures\base_wall\superpipes.tga
<br /><br />3. in Blender a Material for your mesh with a Texture into which you load that image (once loaded you can select it in the UV editor)

After spending much more time wrestling with blender than pushing uvs, here we go:
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225083147/http://members.westnet.com.au/GeoffGole/temp/ratty_terrain05_03_REUNWRAPPED.blend">http://members.westnet.com.au/GeoffGole ... PPED.blend</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />I suggest that you append the object from this file rather than just opening the .blend, since it's not likely you want all my wierd settings. (Putting user interface settings in the same file as mesh data is pretty stupid). Some stuff has been ripped out to make it easier for me to work with the mesh, but don't worry about that - just take a look at the seam placement and uv layout.
<br /><br />First thing to notice is that I don't just use long, continuous seams but also some short one-ended cuts. That allows lcsm to push uvs over those seams, which helps relax stretching. In a few spots that results in mapping that is not 1 to 1, but that shouldn't be a problem when you are using an existing world texture (it's a big nono if your uvs will be used for baking/lightmapping/painting though, keep that in mind). I pushed those spots to where I thought they would be difficult to see - without knowing what your lighting and mesh position is going to be in game it's a bit difficult to know, so you'll want to make that kind of decision for yourself.
<br /><br />Secondly, the unwrapping here is pin-free and based entirely on the cuts that I've made. The only change is that the resulting uvset has been rotated and scaled a bit. If you want to play with the seam layout, just add more and unwrap again.
<br /><br />Lastly, if I was modelling this myself I'd give some thought to other methods of getting rid of seams. There's a big nasty one down the middle of the bottom of this mesh, maybe I'd move that one to where I know there'll be shadows or model a boulder to go on top of it. You pointed out yourself that you could arrange for seams to go where you've blended in the dirt texture, that would be worth looking at. You could also add another crack on the other side of the bridge, as those are perfect spots to hide seams.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157858" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 7:06 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">thanks black dog and this is very interesting <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225083147im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />firstly I didn`t know we could have seams that weren`t continuous edge loops. also great idea to hide the seams in cracks, I think I can do that quite easily from now on, and a few more beveled cracks will make the rocks look more interesting. and as you also suggested, covering them up with other models like boulders.
<br /><br />I might still use the odd pin, but I think your method will save me a lot of time in the future, as my uv maps were getting messed up a lot each time I added in more polys like the cracks, because the excessive pinning I was using was restricting the uv map from automatically shifting around while doing a lscm to compensate for the new polys uv`s.
<br /><br />so was this the first time you`ve used blender or was it just my .blend file that caused you problems? either way, I very much appreciate the time you spent on helping me with this <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225083147im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />did you know we can use the file browser and deselect the "load ui" button at the bottom of the file browser?
<br /><br />this means that each blender user can retain their user prefs but load in other users project data (mesh, textures, materials etc) although some of the global prefs, like the paths blender looks for textures, are saved into the .b.blend file. although even that can be backed up or over written with global prefs for different projects we might be working on.
<br /><br />I do agree though it did seem stupid at first that blender saves some user prefs into the .blend project files, but I`ve got used to it.

<br /><br />I`ll try to not use pinning for my world models, but at least it is something I can fall back on if I struggle with the seams.
<br /><br />am I right in thinking that as long as they are well placed and hidden we could have many seams on a model, especially the one ended type, and the result would still be neat looking uv map, so instead of adding in more pins as I have been doing I add in more seams, yes?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157914" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 9:22 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I haven`t done any of the new uv mapping, so this image is just of blender`s solid view mode, but it shows the rock bridge meshes spanning across the main cave.

<br /><br />Blender is certainly full of stuff to learn. The thing is, I have no need for most of it and I'm more interested in learning to make assets than learning Blender. My focus is entirely on modelling and unwrapping and as such dealing with the complexities of the rendering or materials systems just isn't appealing. Out of all the clever things that got added in 2.42, for instance, the only ones I have real use for are the uvlayout export (decent at last!) and the very useful merge to target vertex. Now they just need to make the knife tool snap to the grid.
<br /><br />While it's possible to have many seams on a model, I don't know that more is always better. The idea is simply to have the surface look as contiguous as possible without stretching, ideally using as few seams as possible.

<br /><br />thanks kit89, and I had already been using "lscm live transform" which is a lot better then lscm on it`s own, if we intend to then tweak the uv`s by hand, but I now think black dog`s suggestion of first making more efficient seams on these game world models, will be the most time saving method, although I`ll still be using lscm live and pinning on non world models.
<br /><br />thinking about it, I`ll probably still use just a couple of pins on the game world models but only so I don`t have to scale, rotate and align the uv maps each time I use lscm to unwrap the model, but I don`t intend to tweak their uv`s by hand.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157991" date="Posted: Sun Sep 24, 2006 8:27 am "><author>kit89</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I'd suggest looking at this tutorial.

<br /><br />I`m pleased with how it looks in blender, but for some reason the vertex colors aren`t working on this model when loaded into blender.
<br /><br />in d3 the "r_showvertexcolor 1" shows a pure white model but in blender the vertex color has the top faces of the rock white fading to black for the sides and bottom of the rock.
<br /><br />could it be something to do with the seams that are preventing this from working?

<br />    thanks and I`ll try a single seam up the back of the horns, I also thought about painting details onto the texture to fit within the exact shape of the horns rather then just use a wall like texture like they apparently did with the original d3 horns/saber teeth. and I`ve been vertex blending them into a rock or dirt texture which seems to work quite well, although the scale is a bit different since the rock models use a large scale on them then the rock base of the horns.
<br /><br />    thanks for the suggestion, but I don`t think I`ll try painting out the seems, although I`ve done that before on some of the d3 character models for my personal mod. it is very time consuming especially when editing the local, height and specular textures as well as the diffuse (color) texture, not that these horns use all those material stages but it`s low priority, as plan to spend as much time on building as many models as possible, as well as all the sp game play events I have in mind <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225083449im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p158133" date="Posted: Mon Sep 25, 2006 3:59 pm "><author>Black Dog</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"> one of the tasks I least enjoy when modeling my meshes is when I have two rows of verts I want to merge together along the seam, rather then all into the same vertex.

If things are nicely aligned axially, sometimes you can get away with using the scaling trick constrained to an axis and do the whole lot at once. Also if you are doing radial work, sometimes you can avoid having to handle each vertex on a curve with smart use of scaling around the cursor, which can get you close enough that remove doubles will finish the job.

<br /><br />    my conclusion is the beveled cracks to hide the uv seams on the undersides of the rock bridge and some of the floating rocks was a waste of polys, especially as the player couldn`t really see them in game unless they noclipped into the air, to get close enough to the undersides of those rocks.
<br /><br />    so when I got home from our long weekend, I merged the polys along either side of the uv seams, as well as redoing the seams and un wrapping for the first rocks I built.
<br /><br />    what I have done though is added in some beveled edges to the cracks the player is likely to see, as they are a better use of the polys I think.
<br /><br />    image shack seems slow today so I`ve only managed to ul one image so far, but will ul and post links to the finished rock bridge asap.
<br /><br />    for now here`s a blender image of the latest version of the first rock, which the player spawns onto.

<br /><br />    I also ran the blender script "uv/image editor\uv menu\texture baker" to output a version of the original pentastic1.tga texture, so in psp7 I could fade to black the inner edges where the decal sits on top of the rock`s cracks.
<br /><br />    I`m especially pleased with how I got the decal`s mesh to follow the contours of those beveled cracks.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p158822" date="Posted: Wed Oct 04, 2006 5:24 pm "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">here`s an in game image of the spawn decal.

<br /><br />    the concept design is they will lead the player down in a spiral type path towards the lava, but also split away to form a 2nd route which will lead into another cave entrance near the rock bridge, then the player will climb a stone spiral stair case built inside the rock walls, and emerge on top of the rock bridge.

<br /><br />we`re now planning for me to move up there over the next couple of weeks, so I`m not sure how much of the hell map I`ll get done until I`m fully set up in her flat. although she does have broadband which will be a welcome upgrade from my 56k I`ve been using for years.
<br /><br />the hell map is at the top of my project list and it will definitely get released oneday, in the mean time I`ll do as much as I can to it when ever possible and keep you people here updated.
<br /><br />I do have a new technical issue I`d like help with.
<br /><br />in these screen images, your see I have built a tunnel entrance into the rock walls at the bottom of the main cave, with the lava flowing into the tunnel. but as the tunnel slopes downwards, I`m having difficulty with the lava fog lights as having two next to each other doesn`t look good in game, I assume because we can see the sides of the fog volume.
<br /><br />is there a way to simulate the fog following the contours of the lava or should I leave out the fog lights?

After spending much more time wrestling with blender than pushing uvs, here we go:
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205111121/http://members.westnet.com.au/GeoffGole/temp/ratty_terrain05_03_REUNWRAPPED.blend">http://members.westnet.com.au/GeoffGole ... PPED.blend</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />I suggest that you append the object from this file rather than just opening the .blend, since it's not likely you want all my wierd settings. (Putting user interface settings in the same file as mesh data is pretty stupid). Some stuff has been ripped out to make it easier for me to work with the mesh, but don't worry about that - just take a look at the seam placement and uv layout.
<br /><br />First thing to notice is that I don't just use long, continuous seams but also some short one-ended cuts. That allows lcsm to push uvs over those seams, which helps relax stretching. In a few spots that results in mapping that is not 1 to 1, but that shouldn't be a problem when you are using an existing world texture (it's a big nono if your uvs will be used for baking/lightmapping/painting though, keep that in mind). I pushed those spots to where I thought they would be difficult to see - without knowing what your lighting and mesh position is going to be in game it's a bit difficult to know, so you'll want to make that kind of decision for yourself.
<br /><br />Secondly, the unwrapping here is pin-free and based entirely on the cuts that I've made. The only change is that the resulting uvset has been rotated and scaled a bit. If you want to play with the seam layout, just add more and unwrap again.
<br /><br />Lastly, if I was modelling this myself I'd give some thought to other methods of getting rid of seams. There's a big nasty one down the middle of the bottom of this mesh, maybe I'd move that one to where I know there'll be shadows or model a boulder to go on top of it. You pointed out yourself that you could arrange for seams to go where you've blended in the dirt texture, that would be worth looking at. You could also add another crack on the other side of the bridge, as those are perfect spots to hide seams.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157858" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 6:06 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">thanks black dog and this is very interesting <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205111121im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />firstly I didn`t know we could have seams that weren`t continuous edge loops. also great idea to hide the seams in cracks, I think I can do that quite easily from now on, and a few more beveled cracks will make the rocks look more interesting. and as you also suggested, covering them up with other models like boulders.
<br /><br />I might still use the odd pin, but I think your method will save me a lot of time in the future, as my uv maps were getting messed up a lot each time I added in more polys like the cracks, because the excessive pinning I was using was restricting the uv map from automatically shifting around while doing a lscm to compensate for the new polys uv`s.
<br /><br />so was this the first time you`ve used blender or was it just my .blend file that caused you problems? either way, I very much appreciate the time you spent on helping me with this <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205111121im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />did you know we can use the file browser and deselect the "load ui" button at the bottom of the file browser?
<br /><br />this means that each blender user can retain their user prefs but load in other users project data (mesh, textures, materials etc) although some of the global prefs, like the paths blender looks for textures, are saved into the .b.blend file. although even that can be backed up or over written with global prefs for different projects we might be working on.
<br /><br />I do agree though it did seem stupid at first that blender saves some user prefs into the .blend project files, but I`ve got used to it.

<br /><br />I`ll try to not use pinning for my world models, but at least it is something I can fall back on if I struggle with the seams.
<br /><br />am I right in thinking that as long as they are well placed and hidden we could have many seams on a model, especially the one ended type, and the result would still be neat looking uv map, so instead of adding in more pins as I have been doing I add in more seams, yes?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157914" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 8:22 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I haven`t done any of the new uv mapping, so this image is just of blender`s solid view mode, but it shows the rock bridge meshes spanning across the main cave.

<br /><br />Blender is certainly full of stuff to learn. The thing is, I have no need for most of it and I'm more interested in learning to make assets than learning Blender. My focus is entirely on modelling and unwrapping and as such dealing with the complexities of the rendering or materials systems just isn't appealing. Out of all the clever things that got added in 2.42, for instance, the only ones I have real use for are the uvlayout export (decent at last!) and the very useful merge to target vertex. Now they just need to make the knife tool snap to the grid.
<br /><br />While it's possible to have many seams on a model, I don't know that more is always better. The idea is simply to have the surface look as contiguous as possible without stretching, ideally using as few seams as possible. Learning how to do that effectively is really just a matter of unwrapping a few models and seeing what works.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157962" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 5:16 pm "><author>kit89</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Looking Good Ratty. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205111121im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />When it comes to UV-mapping in Blender I suggest you try the "Live UnWrap Transform" feature. This allows the skin to change as you move pinned faces making it very flexible to modify skins effectively. Although it wont move pinned faces so its best to have maybe 4 or 5 pins.

After spending much more time wrestling with blender than pushing uvs, here we go:&#13;<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://members.westnet.com.au/GeoffGole/temp/ratty_terrain05_03_REUNWRAPPED.blend">http://members.westnet.com.au/GeoffGole ... PPED.blend</a><!-- m -->&#13;<br /><br />I suggest that you append the object from this file rather than just opening the .blend, since it's not likely you want all my wierd settings. (Putting user interface settings in the same file as mesh data is pretty stupid). Some stuff has been ripped out to make it easier for me to work with the mesh, but don't worry about that - just take a look at the seam placement and uv layout.&#13;<br /><br />First thing to notice is that I don't just use long, continuous seams but also some short one-ended cuts. That allows lcsm to push uvs over those seams, which helps relax stretching. In a few spots that results in mapping that is not 1 to 1, but that shouldn't be a problem when you are using an existing world texture (it's a big nono if your uvs will be used for baking/lightmapping/painting though, keep that in mind). I pushed those spots to where I thought they would be difficult to see - without knowing what your lighting and mesh position is going to be in game it's a bit difficult to know, so you'll want to make that kind of decision for yourself.&#13;<br /><br />Secondly, the unwrapping here is pin-free and based entirely on the cuts that I've made. The only change is that the resulting uvset has been rotated and scaled a bit. If you want to play with the seam layout, just add more and unwrap again.&#13;<br /><br />Lastly, if I was modelling this myself I'd give some thought to other methods of getting rid of seams. There's a big nasty one down the middle of the bottom of this mesh, maybe I'd move that one to where I know there'll be shadows or model a boulder to go on top of it. You pointed out yourself that you could arrange for seams to go where you've blended in the dirt texture, that would be worth looking at. You could also add another crack on the other side of the bridge, as those are perfect spots to hide seams.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157858" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 6:06 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">thanks black dog and this is very interesting <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />firstly I didn`t know we could have seams that weren`t continuous edge loops. also great idea to hide the seams in cracks, I think I can do that quite easily from now on, and a few more beveled cracks will make the rocks look more interesting. and as you also suggested, covering them up with other models like boulders.&#13;<br /><br />I might still use the odd pin, but I think your method will save me a lot of time in the future, as my uv maps were getting messed up a lot each time I added in more polys like the cracks, because the excessive pinning I was using was restricting the uv map from automatically shifting around while doing a lscm to compensate for the new polys uv`s.&#13;<br /><br />so was this the first time you`ve used blender or was it just my .blend file that caused you problems? either way, I very much appreciate the time you spent on helping me with this <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />did you know we can use the file browser and deselect the "load ui" button at the bottom of the file browser?&#13;<br /><br />this means that each blender user can retain their user prefs but load in other users project data (mesh, textures, materials etc) although some of the global prefs, like the paths blender looks for textures, are saved into the .b.blend file. although even that can be backed up or over written with global prefs for different projects we might be working on.&#13;<br /><br />I do agree though it did seem stupid at first that blender saves some user prefs into the .blend project files, but I`ve got used to it.&#13;<br /><br />which is the main modeling app you use?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157864" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 7:08 am "><author>Black Dog</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I use blender extensively, but rather narrowly.

You pointed out yourself that you could arrange for seams to go where you've blended in the dirt texture, that would be worth looking at. You could also add another crack on the other side of the bridge, as those are perfect spots to hide seams.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157858" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 6:06 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">thanks black dog and this is very interesting <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />firstly I didn`t know we could have seams that weren`t continuous edge loops. also great idea to hide the seams in cracks, I think I can do that quite easily from now on, and a few more beveled cracks will make the rocks look more interesting. and as you also suggested, covering them up with other models like boulders.
<br /><br />I might still use the odd pin, but I think your method will save me a lot of time in the future, as my uv maps were getting messed up a lot each time I added in more polys like the cracks, because the excessive pinning I was using was restricting the uv map from automatically shifting around while doing a lscm to compensate for the new polys uv`s.
<br /><br />so was this the first time you`ve used blender or was it just my .blend file that caused you problems? either way, I very much appreciate the time you spent on helping me with this <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />did you know we can use the file browser and deselect the "load ui" button at the bottom of the file browser?
<br /><br />this means that each blender user can retain their user prefs but load in other users project data (mesh, textures, materials etc) although some of the global prefs, like the paths blender looks for textures, are saved into the .b.blend file. although even that can be backed up or over written with global prefs for different projects we might be working on.
<br /><br />I do agree though it did seem stupid at first that blender saves some user prefs into the .blend project files, but I`ve got used to it.
<br /><br />which is the main modeling app you use?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157864" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 7:08 am "><author>Black Dog</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I use blender extensively, but rather narrowly.

<br /><br />That's the main disadvantage of pinning.

<br /><br />I`m now using blender more then any other editor, but every week I learn something new about it or realize the potential of a feature I vaguely knew about previously. if users can get past the very steep learning curve of its interface, then it`s amazing how feature packed it is, would you agree?
<br /><br />I`ll try to not use pinning for my world models, but at least it is something I can fall back on if I struggle with the seams.
<br /><br />am I right in thinking that as long as they are well placed and hidden we could have many seams on a model, especially the one ended type, and the result would still be neat looking uv map, so instead of adding in more pins as I have been doing I add in more seams, yes?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157914" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 8:22 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I haven`t done any of the new uv mapping, so this image is just of blender`s solid view mode, but it shows the rock bridge meshes spanning across the main cave.

<br /><br />Blender is certainly full of stuff to learn. The thing is, I have no need for most of it and I'm more interested in learning to make assets than learning Blender. My focus is entirely on modelling and unwrapping and as such dealing with the complexities of the rendering or materials systems just isn't appealing. Out of all the clever things that got added in 2.42, for instance, the only ones I have real use for are the uvlayout export (decent at last!) and the very useful merge to target vertex. Now they just need to make the knife tool snap to the grid.
<br /><br />While it's possible to have many seams on a model, I don't know that more is always better. The idea is simply to have the surface look as contiguous as possible without stretching, ideally using as few seams as possible. Learning how to do that effectively is really just a matter of unwrapping a few models and seeing what works.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157962" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 5:16 pm "><author>kit89</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Looking Good Ratty. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />When it comes to UV-mapping in Blender I suggest you try the "Live UnWrap Transform" feature.

<br /><br />thanks kit89, and I had already been using "lscm live transform" which is a lot better then lscm on it`s own, if we intend to then tweak the uv`s by hand, but I now think black dog`s suggestion of first making more efficient seams on these game world models, will be the most time saving method, although I`ll still be using lscm live and pinning on non world models.
<br /><br />thinking about it, I`ll probably still use just a couple of pins on the game world models but only so I don`t have to scale, rotate and align the uv maps each time I use lscm to unwrap the model, but I don`t intend to tweak their uv`s by hand.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157991" date="Posted: Sun Sep 24, 2006 7:27 am "><author>kit89</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I'd suggest looking at this tutorial.

						<div class="postbody">zombie13, sorry it took so long, but I`ve just tested inline 1 on a couple of my .ase models.
<br /><br />if there is any vertex colors like the black to white fades we use to control texture blends, then it changes the some of the white to greens or blues, which I can`t see where they are coming from since my rock texture and the d3 dirt I was using don`t appear to have either of those colors in them.
<br /><br />I also tested the "textures/common/collision" material on some of my .ase models and it doesn`t seem to clip the player or their weapon projectiles, but some of d3`s clip materials did work, also doing a window context search of the original d3 mapobjects resulted in only .lwo models to use the collision material.</div>

						<div class="postbody">OK, I had some serious trouble with that. After spending much more time wrestling with blender than pushing uvs, here we go:
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://members.westnet.com.au/GeoffGole/temp/ratty_terrain05_03_REUNWRAPPED.blend">http://members.westnet.com.au/GeoffGole ... PPED.blend</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />I suggest that you append the object from this file rather than just opening the .blend, since it's not likely you want all my wierd settings. (Putting user interface settings in the same file as mesh data is pretty stupid). Some stuff has been ripped out to make it easier for me to work with the mesh, but don't worry about that - just take a look at the seam placement and uv layout.
<br /><br />First thing to notice is that I don't just use long, continuous seams but also some short one-ended cuts. That allows lcsm to push uvs over those seams, which helps relax stretching. In a few spots that results in mapping that is not 1 to 1, but that shouldn't be a problem when you are using an existing world texture (it's a big nono if your uvs will be used for baking/lightmapping/painting though, keep that in mind). I pushed those spots to where I thought they would be difficult to see - without knowing what your lighting and mesh position is going to be in game it's a bit difficult to know, so you'll want to make that kind of decision for yourself.
<br /><br />Secondly, the unwrapping here is pin-free and based entirely on the cuts that I've made. The only change is that the resulting uvset has been rotated and scaled a bit. If you want to play with the seam layout, just add more and unwrap again.
<br /><br />Lastly, if I was modelling this myself I'd give some thought to other methods of getting rid of seams. There's a big nasty one down the middle of the bottom of this mesh, maybe I'd move that one to where I know there'll be shadows or model a boulder to go on top of it. You pointed out yourself that you could arrange for seams to go where you've blended in the dirt texture, that would be worth looking at. You could also add another crack on the other side of the bridge, as those are perfect spots to hide seams.</div>

						<div class="postbody">thanks black dog and this is very interesting <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />firstly I didn`t know we could have seams that weren`t continuous edge loops. also great idea to hide the seams in cracks, I think I can do that quite easily from now on, and a few more beveled cracks will make the rocks look more interesting. and as you also suggested, covering them up with other models like boulders.
<br /><br />I might still use the odd pin, but I think your method will save me a lot of time in the future, as my uv maps were getting messed up a lot each time I added in more polys like the cracks, because the excessive pinning I was using was restricting the uv map from automatically shifting around while doing a lscm to compensate for the new polys uv`s.
<br /><br />so was this the first time you`ve used blender or was it just my .blend file that caused you problems? either way, I very much appreciate the time you spent on helping me with this <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />did you know we can use the file browser and deselect the "load ui" button at the bottom of the file browser?
<br /><br />this means that each blender user can retain their user prefs but load in other users project data (mesh, textures, materials etc) although some of the global prefs, like the paths blender looks for textures, are saved into the .b.blend file. although even that can be backed up or over written with global prefs for different projects we might be working on.
<br /><br />I do agree though it did seem stupid at first that blender saves some user prefs into the .blend project files, but I`ve got used to it.
<br /><br />which is the main modeling app you use?</div>

						<div class="postbody">understood black dog, and I hope I didn`t sound patronizing when telling you about "load ui" button?
<br /><br />I`m now using blender more then any other editor, but every week I learn something new about it or realize the potential of a feature I vaguely knew about previously. if users can get past the very steep learning curve of its interface, then it`s amazing how feature packed it is, would you agree?
<br /><br />I`ll try to not use pinning for my world models, but at least it is something I can fall back on if I struggle with the seams.
<br /><br />am I right in thinking that as long as they are well placed and hidden we could have many seams on a model, especially the one ended type, and the result would still be neat looking uv map, so instead of adding in more pins as I have been doing I add in more seams, yes?</div>

<br /><br />Blender is certainly full of stuff to learn. The thing is, I have no need for most of it and I'm more interested in learning to make assets than learning Blender. My focus is entirely on modelling and unwrapping and as such dealing with the complexities of the rendering or materials systems just isn't appealing. Out of all the clever things that got added in 2.42, for instance, the only ones I have real use for are the uvlayout export (decent at last!) and the very useful merge to target vertex. Now they just need to make the knife tool snap to the grid.
<br /><br />While it's possible to have many seams on a model, I don't know that more is always better. The idea is simply to have the surface look as contiguous as possible without stretching, ideally using as few seams as possible. Learning how to do that effectively is really just a matter of unwrapping a few models and seeing what works.</div>

<br /><br />thanks kit89, and I had already been using "lscm live transform" which is a lot better then lscm on it`s own, if we intend to then tweak the uv`s by hand, but I now think black dog`s suggestion of first making more efficient seams on these game world models, will be the most time saving method, although I`ll still be using lscm live and pinning on non world models.
<br /><br />thinking about it, I`ll probably still use just a couple of pins on the game world models but only so I don`t have to scale, rotate and align the uv maps each time I use lscm to unwrap the model, but I don`t intend to tweak their uv`s by hand.</div>

After spending much more time wrestling with blender than pushing uvs, here we go:
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://members.westnet.com.au/GeoffGole/temp/ratty_terrain05_03_REUNWRAPPED.blend">http://members.westnet.com.au/GeoffGole ... PPED.blend</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />I suggest that you append the object from this file rather than just opening the .blend, since it's not likely you want all my wierd settings. (Putting user interface settings in the same file as mesh data is pretty stupid). Some stuff has been ripped out to make it easier for me to work with the mesh, but don't worry about that - just take a look at the seam placement and uv layout.
<br /><br />First thing to notice is that I don't just use long, continuous seams but also some short one-ended cuts. That allows lcsm to push uvs over those seams, which helps relax stretching. In a few spots that results in mapping that is not 1 to 1, but that shouldn't be a problem when you are using an existing world texture (it's a big nono if your uvs will be used for baking/lightmapping/painting though, keep that in mind). I pushed those spots to where I thought they would be difficult to see - without knowing what your lighting and mesh position is going to be in game it's a bit difficult to know, so you'll want to make that kind of decision for yourself.
<br /><br />Secondly, the unwrapping here is pin-free and based entirely on the cuts that I've made. The only change is that the resulting uvset has been rotated and scaled a bit. If you want to play with the seam layout, just add more and unwrap again.
<br /><br />Lastly, if I was modelling this myself I'd give some thought to other methods of getting rid of seams. There's a big nasty one down the middle of the bottom of this mesh, maybe I'd move that one to where I know there'll be shadows or model a boulder to go on top of it. You pointed out yourself that you could arrange for seams to go where you've blended in the dirt texture, that would be worth looking at. You could also add another crack on the other side of the bridge, as those are perfect spots to hide seams.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157858" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 6:06 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">thanks black dog and this is very interesting <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />firstly I didn`t know we could have seams that weren`t continuous edge loops. also great idea to hide the seams in cracks, I think I can do that quite easily from now on, and a few more beveled cracks will make the rocks look more interesting. and as you also suggested, covering them up with other models like boulders.
<br /><br />I might still use the odd pin, but I think your method will save me a lot of time in the future, as my uv maps were getting messed up a lot each time I added in more polys like the cracks, because the excessive pinning I was using was restricting the uv map from automatically shifting around while doing a lscm to compensate for the new polys uv`s.
<br /><br />so was this the first time you`ve used blender or was it just my .blend file that caused you problems? either way, I very much appreciate the time you spent on helping me with this <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />did you know we can use the file browser and deselect the "load ui" button at the bottom of the file browser?
<br /><br />this means that each blender user can retain their user prefs but load in other users project data (mesh, textures, materials etc) although some of the global prefs, like the paths blender looks for textures, are saved into the .b.blend file. although even that can be backed up or over written with global prefs for different projects we might be working on.
<br /><br />I do agree though it did seem stupid at first that blender saves some user prefs into the .blend project files, but I`ve got used to it.
<br /><br />which is the main modeling app you use?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157864" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 7:08 am "><author>Black Dog</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I use blender extensively, but rather narrowly.

<br /><br />I`m now using blender more then any other editor, but every week I learn something new about it or realize the potential of a feature I vaguely knew about previously. if users can get past the very steep learning curve of its interface, then it`s amazing how feature packed it is, would you agree?
<br /><br />I`ll try to not use pinning for my world models, but at least it is something I can fall back on if I struggle with the seams.
<br /><br />am I right in thinking that as long as they are well placed and hidden we could have many seams on a model, especially the one ended type, and the result would still be neat looking uv map, so instead of adding in more pins as I have been doing I add in more seams, yes?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157914" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 8:22 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I haven`t done any of the new uv mapping, so this image is just of blender`s solid view mode, but it shows the rock bridge meshes spanning across the main cave.

<br /><br />Blender is certainly full of stuff to learn. The thing is, I have no need for most of it and I'm more interested in learning to make assets than learning Blender. My focus is entirely on modelling and unwrapping and as such dealing with the complexities of the rendering or materials systems just isn't appealing. Out of all the clever things that got added in 2.42, for instance, the only ones I have real use for are the uvlayout export (decent at last!) and the very useful merge to target vertex. Now they just need to make the knife tool snap to the grid.
<br /><br />While it's possible to have many seams on a model, I don't know that more is always better. The idea is simply to have the surface look as contiguous as possible without stretching, ideally using as few seams as possible. Learning how to do that effectively is really just a matter of unwrapping a few models and seeing what works.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157962" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 5:16 pm "><author>kit89</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Looking Good Ratty. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />When it comes to UV-mapping in Blender I suggest you try the "Live UnWrap Transform" feature. This allows the skin to change as you move pinned faces making it very flexible to modify skins effectively. Although it wont move pinned faces so its best to have maybe 4 or 5 pins.

<br /><br />thanks kit89, and I had already been using "lscm live transform" which is a lot better then lscm on it`s own, if we intend to then tweak the uv`s by hand, but I now think black dog`s suggestion of first making more efficient seams on these game world models, will be the most time saving method, although I`ll still be using lscm live and pinning on non world models.
<br /><br />thinking about it, I`ll probably still use just a couple of pins on the game world models but only so I don`t have to scale, rotate and align the uv maps each time I use lscm to unwrap the model, but I don`t intend to tweak their uv`s by hand.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157991" date="Posted: Sun Sep 24, 2006 7:27 am "><author>kit89</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I'd suggest looking at this tutorial.

						<div class="postbody">zombie13, sorry it took so long, but I`ve just tested inline 1 on a couple of my .ase models.
<br /><br />if there is any vertex colors like the black to white fades we use to control texture blends, then it changes the some of the white to greens or blues, which I can`t see where they are coming from since my rock texture and the d3 dirt I was using don`t appear to have either of those colors in them.
<br /><br />I also tested the "textures/common/collision" material on some of my .ase models and it doesn`t seem to clip the player or their weapon projectiles, but some of d3`s clip materials did work, also doing a window context search of the original d3 mapobjects resulted in only .lwo models to use the collision material.</div>

						<div class="postbody">OK, I had some serious trouble with that. After spending much more time wrestling with blender than pushing uvs, here we go:
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://members.westnet.com.au/GeoffGole/temp/ratty_terrain05_03_REUNWRAPPED.blend">http://members.westnet.com.au/GeoffGole ... PPED.blend</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />I suggest that you append the object from this file rather than just opening the .blend, since it's not likely you want all my wierd settings. (Putting user interface settings in the same file as mesh data is pretty stupid). Some stuff has been ripped out to make it easier for me to work with the mesh, but don't worry about that - just take a look at the seam placement and uv layout.
<br /><br />First thing to notice is that I don't just use long, continuous seams but also some short one-ended cuts. That allows lcsm to push uvs over those seams, which helps relax stretching. In a few spots that results in mapping that is not 1 to 1, but that shouldn't be a problem when you are using an existing world texture (it's a big nono if your uvs will be used for baking/lightmapping/painting though, keep that in mind). I pushed those spots to where I thought they would be difficult to see - without knowing what your lighting and mesh position is going to be in game it's a bit difficult to know, so you'll want to make that kind of decision for yourself.
<br /><br />Secondly, the unwrapping here is pin-free and based entirely on the cuts that I've made. The only change is that the resulting uvset has been rotated and scaled a bit. If you want to play with the seam layout, just add more and unwrap again.
<br /><br />Lastly, if I was modelling this myself I'd give some thought to other methods of getting rid of seams. There's a big nasty one down the middle of the bottom of this mesh, maybe I'd move that one to where I know there'll be shadows or model a boulder to go on top of it. You pointed out yourself that you could arrange for seams to go where you've blended in the dirt texture, that would be worth looking at. You could also add another crack on the other side of the bridge, as those are perfect spots to hide seams.</div>

						<div class="postbody">thanks black dog and this is very interesting <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />firstly I didn`t know we could have seams that weren`t continuous edge loops. also great idea to hide the seams in cracks, I think I can do that quite easily from now on, and a few more beveled cracks will make the rocks look more interesting. and as you also suggested, covering them up with other models like boulders.
<br /><br />I might still use the odd pin, but I think your method will save me a lot of time in the future, as my uv maps were getting messed up a lot each time I added in more polys like the cracks, because the excessive pinning I was using was restricting the uv map from automatically shifting around while doing a lscm to compensate for the new polys uv`s.
<br /><br />so was this the first time you`ve used blender or was it just my .blend file that caused you problems? either way, I very much appreciate the time you spent on helping me with this <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />did you know we can use the file browser and deselect the "load ui" button at the bottom of the file browser?
<br /><br />this means that each blender user can retain their user prefs but load in other users project data (mesh, textures, materials etc) although some of the global prefs, like the paths blender looks for textures, are saved into the .b.blend file. although even that can be backed up or over written with global prefs for different projects we might be working on.
<br /><br />I do agree though it did seem stupid at first that blender saves some user prefs into the .blend project files, but I`ve got used to it.
<br /><br />which is the main modeling app you use?</div>

						<div class="postbody">understood black dog, and I hope I didn`t sound patronizing when telling you about "load ui" button?
<br /><br />I`m now using blender more then any other editor, but every week I learn something new about it or realize the potential of a feature I vaguely knew about previously. if users can get past the very steep learning curve of its interface, then it`s amazing how feature packed it is, would you agree?
<br /><br />I`ll try to not use pinning for my world models, but at least it is something I can fall back on if I struggle with the seams.
<br /><br />am I right in thinking that as long as they are well placed and hidden we could have many seams on a model, especially the one ended type, and the result would still be neat looking uv map, so instead of adding in more pins as I have been doing I add in more seams, yes?</div>

<br /><br />Blender is certainly full of stuff to learn. The thing is, I have no need for most of it and I'm more interested in learning to make assets than learning Blender. My focus is entirely on modelling and unwrapping and as such dealing with the complexities of the rendering or materials systems just isn't appealing. Out of all the clever things that got added in 2.42, for instance, the only ones I have real use for are the uvlayout export (decent at last!) and the very useful merge to target vertex. Now they just need to make the knife tool snap to the grid.
<br /><br />While it's possible to have many seams on a model, I don't know that more is always better. The idea is simply to have the surface look as contiguous as possible without stretching, ideally using as few seams as possible. Learning how to do that effectively is really just a matter of unwrapping a few models and seeing what works.</div>

<br /><br />thanks kit89, and I had already been using "lscm live transform" which is a lot better then lscm on it`s own, if we intend to then tweak the uv`s by hand, but I now think black dog`s suggestion of first making more efficient seams on these game world models, will be the most time saving method, although I`ll still be using lscm live and pinning on non world models.
<br /><br />thinking about it, I`ll probably still use just a couple of pins on the game world models but only so I don`t have to scale, rotate and align the uv maps each time I use lscm to unwrap the model, but I don`t intend to tweak their uv`s by hand.</div>

After spending much more time wrestling with blender than pushing uvs, here we go:
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://members.westnet.com.au/GeoffGole/temp/ratty_terrain05_03_REUNWRAPPED.blend">http://members.westnet.com.au/GeoffGole ... PPED.blend</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />I suggest that you append the object from this file rather than just opening the .blend, since it's not likely you want all my wierd settings. (Putting user interface settings in the same file as mesh data is pretty stupid). Some stuff has been ripped out to make it easier for me to work with the mesh, but don't worry about that - just take a look at the seam placement and uv layout.
<br /><br />First thing to notice is that I don't just use long, continuous seams but also some short one-ended cuts. That allows lcsm to push uvs over those seams, which helps relax stretching. In a few spots that results in mapping that is not 1 to 1, but that shouldn't be a problem when you are using an existing world texture (it's a big nono if your uvs will be used for baking/lightmapping/painting though, keep that in mind). I pushed those spots to where I thought they would be difficult to see - without knowing what your lighting and mesh position is going to be in game it's a bit difficult to know, so you'll want to make that kind of decision for yourself.
<br /><br />Secondly, the unwrapping here is pin-free and based entirely on the cuts that I've made. The only change is that the resulting uvset has been rotated and scaled a bit. If you want to play with the seam layout, just add more and unwrap again.
<br /><br />Lastly, if I was modelling this myself I'd give some thought to other methods of getting rid of seams. There's a big nasty one down the middle of the bottom of this mesh, maybe I'd move that one to where I know there'll be shadows or model a boulder to go on top of it. You pointed out yourself that you could arrange for seams to go where you've blended in the dirt texture, that would be worth looking at. You could also add another crack on the other side of the bridge, as those are perfect spots to hide seams.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157858" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 6:06 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">thanks black dog and this is very interesting <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />firstly I didn`t know we could have seams that weren`t continuous edge loops. also great idea to hide the seams in cracks, I think I can do that quite easily from now on, and a few more beveled cracks will make the rocks look more interesting. and as you also suggested, covering them up with other models like boulders.
<br /><br />I might still use the odd pin, but I think your method will save me a lot of time in the future, as my uv maps were getting messed up a lot each time I added in more polys like the cracks, because the excessive pinning I was using was restricting the uv map from automatically shifting around while doing a lscm to compensate for the new polys uv`s.
<br /><br />so was this the first time you`ve used blender or was it just my .blend file that caused you problems? either way, I very much appreciate the time you spent on helping me with this <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />did you know we can use the file browser and deselect the "load ui" button at the bottom of the file browser?
<br /><br />this means that each blender user can retain their user prefs but load in other users project data (mesh, textures, materials etc) although some of the global prefs, like the paths blender looks for textures, are saved into the .b.blend file. although even that can be backed up or over written with global prefs for different projects we might be working on.
<br /><br />I do agree though it did seem stupid at first that blender saves some user prefs into the .blend project files, but I`ve got used to it.
<br /><br />which is the main modeling app you use?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157864" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 7:08 am "><author>Black Dog</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I use blender extensively, but rather narrowly.

<br /><br />I`m now using blender more then any other editor, but every week I learn something new about it or realize the potential of a feature I vaguely knew about previously. if users can get past the very steep learning curve of its interface, then it`s amazing how feature packed it is, would you agree?

After spending much more time wrestling with blender than pushing uvs, here we go:
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://members.westnet.com.au/GeoffGole/temp/ratty_terrain05_03_REUNWRAPPED.blend">http://members.westnet.com.au/GeoffGole ... PPED.blend</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />I suggest that you append the object from this file rather than just opening the .blend, since it's not likely you want all my wierd settings. (Putting user interface settings in the same file as mesh data is pretty stupid). Some stuff has been ripped out to make it easier for me to work with the mesh, but don't worry about that - just take a look at the seam placement and uv layout.
<br /><br />First thing to notice is that I don't just use long, continuous seams but also some short one-ended cuts. That allows lcsm to push uvs over those seams, which helps relax stretching. In a few spots that results in mapping that is not 1 to 1, but that shouldn't be a problem when you are using an existing world texture (it's a big nono if your uvs will be used for baking/lightmapping/painting though, keep that in mind). I pushed those spots to where I thought they would be difficult to see - without knowing what your lighting and mesh position is going to be in game it's a bit difficult to know, so you'll want to make that kind of decision for yourself.
<br /><br />Secondly, the unwrapping here is pin-free and based entirely on the cuts that I've made. The only change is that the resulting uvset has been rotated and scaled a bit. If you want to play with the seam layout, just add more and unwrap again.
<br /><br />Lastly, if I was modelling this myself I'd give some thought to other methods of getting rid of seams. There's a big nasty one down the middle of the bottom of this mesh, maybe I'd move that one to where I know there'll be shadows or model a boulder to go on top of it. You pointed out yourself that you could arrange for seams to go where you've blended in the dirt texture, that would be worth looking at. You could also add another crack on the other side of the bridge, as those are perfect spots to hide seams.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157858" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 6:06 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">thanks black dog and this is very interesting <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />firstly I didn`t know we could have seams that weren`t continuous edge loops. also great idea to hide the seams in cracks, I think I can do that quite easily from now on, and a few more beveled cracks will make the rocks look more interesting. and as you also suggested, covering them up with other models like boulders.
<br /><br />I might still use the odd pin, but I think your method will save me a lot of time in the future, as my uv maps were getting messed up a lot each time I added in more polys like the cracks, because the excessive pinning I was using was restricting the uv map from automatically shifting around while doing a lscm to compensate for the new polys uv`s.
<br /><br />so was this the first time you`ve used blender or was it just my .blend file that caused you problems? either way, I very much appreciate the time you spent on helping me with this <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />did you know we can use the file browser and deselect the "load ui" button at the bottom of the file browser?
<br /><br />this means that each blender user can retain their user prefs but load in other users project data (mesh, textures, materials etc) although some of the global prefs, like the paths blender looks for textures, are saved into the .b.blend file. although even that can be backed up or over written with global prefs for different projects we might be working on.
<br /><br />I do agree though it did seem stupid at first that blender saves some user prefs into the .blend project files, but I`ve got used to it.
<br /><br />which is the main modeling app you use?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157864" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 7:08 am "><author>Black Dog</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I use blender extensively, but rather narrowly.

						<div class="postbody">zombie13, sorry it took so long, but I`ve just tested inline 1 on a couple of my .ase models.
<br /><br />if there is any vertex colors like the black to white fades we use to control texture blends, then it changes the some of the white to greens or blues, which I can`t see where they are coming from since my rock texture and the d3 dirt I was using don`t appear to have either of those colors in them.
<br /><br />I also tested the "textures/common/collision" material on some of my .ase models and it doesn`t seem to clip the player or their weapon projectiles, but some of d3`s clip materials did work, also doing a window context search of the original d3 mapobjects resulted in only .lwo models to use the collision material.</div>

						<div class="postbody">OK, I had some serious trouble with that. After spending much more time wrestling with blender than pushing uvs, here we go:
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://members.westnet.com.au/GeoffGole/temp/ratty_terrain05_03_REUNWRAPPED.blend">http://members.westnet.com.au/GeoffGole ... PPED.blend</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />I suggest that you append the object from this file rather than just opening the .blend, since it's not likely you want all my wierd settings. (Putting user interface settings in the same file as mesh data is pretty stupid). Some stuff has been ripped out to make it easier for me to work with the mesh, but don't worry about that - just take a look at the seam placement and uv layout.
<br /><br />First thing to notice is that I don't just use long, continuous seams but also some short one-ended cuts. That allows lcsm to push uvs over those seams, which helps relax stretching. In a few spots that results in mapping that is not 1 to 1, but that shouldn't be a problem when you are using an existing world texture (it's a big nono if your uvs will be used for baking/lightmapping/painting though, keep that in mind). I pushed those spots to where I thought they would be difficult to see - without knowing what your lighting and mesh position is going to be in game it's a bit difficult to know, so you'll want to make that kind of decision for yourself.
<br /><br />Secondly, the unwrapping here is pin-free and based entirely on the cuts that I've made. The only change is that the resulting uvset has been rotated and scaled a bit. If you want to play with the seam layout, just add more and unwrap again.
<br /><br />Lastly, if I was modelling this myself I'd give some thought to other methods of getting rid of seams. There's a big nasty one down the middle of the bottom of this mesh, maybe I'd move that one to where I know there'll be shadows or model a boulder to go on top of it. You pointed out yourself that you could arrange for seams to go where you've blended in the dirt texture, that would be worth looking at. You could also add another crack on the other side of the bridge, as those are perfect spots to hide seams.</div>

						<div class="postbody">thanks black dog and this is very interesting <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />firstly I didn`t know we could have seams that weren`t continuous edge loops. also great idea to hide the seams in cracks, I think I can do that quite easily from now on, and a few more beveled cracks will make the rocks look more interesting. and as you also suggested, covering them up with other models like boulders.
<br /><br />I might still use the odd pin, but I think your method will save me a lot of time in the future, as my uv maps were getting messed up a lot each time I added in more polys like the cracks, because the excessive pinning I was using was restricting the uv map from automatically shifting around while doing a lscm to compensate for the new polys uv`s.
<br /><br />so was this the first time you`ve used blender or was it just my .blend file that caused you problems? either way, I very much appreciate the time you spent on helping me with this <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />did you know we can use the file browser and deselect the "load ui" button at the bottom of the file browser?
<br /><br />this means that each blender user can retain their user prefs but load in other users project data (mesh, textures, materials etc) although some of the global prefs, like the paths blender looks for textures, are saved into the .b.blend file. although even that can be backed up or over written with global prefs for different projects we might be working on.
<br /><br />I do agree though it did seem stupid at first that blender saves some user prefs into the .blend project files, but I`ve got used to it.
<br /><br />which is the main modeling app you use?</div>

						<div class="postbody">understood black dog, and I hope I didn`t sound patronizing when telling you about "load ui" button?
<br /><br />I`m now using blender more then any other editor, but every week I learn something new about it or realize the potential of a feature I vaguely knew about previously. if users can get past the very steep learning curve of its interface, then it`s amazing how feature packed it is, would you agree?
<br /><br />I`ll try to not use pinning for my world models, but at least it is something I can fall back on if I struggle with the seams.
<br /><br />am I right in thinking that as long as they are well placed and hidden we could have many seams on a model, especially the one ended type, and the result would still be neat looking uv map, so instead of adding in more pins as I have been doing I add in more seams, yes?</div>

<br /><br />Blender is certainly full of stuff to learn. The thing is, I have no need for most of it and I'm more interested in learning to make assets than learning Blender. My focus is entirely on modelling and unwrapping and as such dealing with the complexities of the rendering or materials systems just isn't appealing. Out of all the clever things that got added in 2.42, for instance, the only ones I have real use for are the uvlayout export (decent at last!) and the very useful merge to target vertex. Now they just need to make the knife tool snap to the grid.
<br /><br />While it's possible to have many seams on a model, I don't know that more is always better. The idea is simply to have the surface look as contiguous as possible without stretching, ideally using as few seams as possible. Learning how to do that effectively is really just a matter of unwrapping a few models and seeing what works.</div>

<br /><br />thanks kit89, and I had already been using "lscm live transform" which is a lot better then lscm on it`s own, if we intend to then tweak the uv`s by hand, but I now think black dog`s suggestion of first making more efficient seams on these game world models, will be the most time saving method, although I`ll still be using lscm live and pinning on non world models.
<br /><br />thinking about it, I`ll probably still use just a couple of pins on the game world models but only so I don`t have to scale, rotate and align the uv maps each time I use lscm to unwrap the model, but I don`t intend to tweak their uv`s by hand.</div>

After spending much more time wrestling with blender than pushing uvs, here we go:
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://members.westnet.com.au/GeoffGole/temp/ratty_terrain05_03_REUNWRAPPED.blend">http://members.westnet.com.au/GeoffGole ... PPED.blend</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />I suggest that you append the object from this file rather than just opening the .blend, since it's not likely you want all my wierd settings. (Putting user interface settings in the same file as mesh data is pretty stupid). Some stuff has been ripped out to make it easier for me to work with the mesh, but don't worry about that - just take a look at the seam placement and uv layout.
<br /><br />First thing to notice is that I don't just use long, continuous seams but also some short one-ended cuts. That allows lcsm to push uvs over those seams, which helps relax stretching. In a few spots that results in mapping that is not 1 to 1, but that shouldn't be a problem when you are using an existing world texture (it's a big nono if your uvs will be used for baking/lightmapping/painting though, keep that in mind). I pushed those spots to where I thought they would be difficult to see - without knowing what your lighting and mesh position is going to be in game it's a bit difficult to know, so you'll want to make that kind of decision for yourself.
<br /><br />Secondly, the unwrapping here is pin-free and based entirely on the cuts that I've made. The only change is that the resulting uvset has been rotated and scaled a bit. If you want to play with the seam layout, just add more and unwrap again.
<br /><br />Lastly, if I was modelling this myself I'd give some thought to other methods of getting rid of seams. There's a big nasty one down the middle of the bottom of this mesh, maybe I'd move that one to where I know there'll be shadows or model a boulder to go on top of it. You pointed out yourself that you could arrange for seams to go where you've blended in the dirt texture, that would be worth looking at. You could also add another crack on the other side of the bridge, as those are perfect spots to hide seams.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157858" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 6:06 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">thanks black dog and this is very interesting <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />firstly I didn`t know we could have seams that weren`t continuous edge loops. also great idea to hide the seams in cracks, I think I can do that quite easily from now on, and a few more beveled cracks will make the rocks look more interesting. and as you also suggested, covering them up with other models like boulders.
<br /><br />I might still use the odd pin, but I think your method will save me a lot of time in the future, as my uv maps were getting messed up a lot each time I added in more polys like the cracks, because the excessive pinning I was using was restricting the uv map from automatically shifting around while doing a lscm to compensate for the new polys uv`s.
<br /><br />so was this the first time you`ve used blender or was it just my .blend file that caused you problems? either way, I very much appreciate the time you spent on helping me with this <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />did you know we can use the file browser and deselect the "load ui" button at the bottom of the file browser?
<br /><br />this means that each blender user can retain their user prefs but load in other users project data (mesh, textures, materials etc) although some of the global prefs, like the paths blender looks for textures, are saved into the .b.blend file. although even that can be backed up or over written with global prefs for different projects we might be working on.
<br /><br />I do agree though it did seem stupid at first that blender saves some user prefs into the .blend project files, but I`ve got used to it.
<br /><br />which is the main modeling app you use?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157864" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 7:08 am "><author>Black Dog</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I use blender extensively, but rather narrowly.

<br /><br />I`m now using blender more then any other editor, but every week I learn something new about it or realize the potential of a feature I vaguely knew about previously. if users can get past the very steep learning curve of its interface, then it`s amazing how feature packed it is, would you agree?
<br /><br />I`ll try to not use pinning for my world models, but at least it is something I can fall back on if I struggle with the seams.
<br /><br />am I right in thinking that as long as they are well placed and hidden we could have many seams on a model, especially the one ended type, and the result would still be neat looking uv map, so instead of adding in more pins as I have been doing I add in more seams, yes?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157914" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 8:22 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I haven`t done any of the new uv mapping, so this image is just of blender`s solid view mode, but it shows the rock bridge meshes spanning across the main cave.

<br /><br />Blender is certainly full of stuff to learn. The thing is, I have no need for most of it and I'm more interested in learning to make assets than learning Blender. My focus is entirely on modelling and unwrapping and as such dealing with the complexities of the rendering or materials systems just isn't appealing. Out of all the clever things that got added in 2.42, for instance, the only ones I have real use for are the uvlayout export (decent at last!) and the very useful merge to target vertex. Now they just need to make the knife tool snap to the grid.
<br /><br />While it's possible to have many seams on a model, I don't know that more is always better. The idea is simply to have the surface look as contiguous as possible without stretching, ideally using as few seams as possible. Learning how to do that effectively is really just a matter of unwrapping a few models and seeing what works.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157962" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 5:16 pm "><author>kit89</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Looking Good Ratty. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />When it comes to UV-mapping in Blender I suggest you try the "Live UnWrap Transform" feature.

<br /><br />thanks kit89, and I had already been using "lscm live transform" which is a lot better then lscm on it`s own, if we intend to then tweak the uv`s by hand, but I now think black dog`s suggestion of first making more efficient seams on these game world models, will be the most time saving method, although I`ll still be using lscm live and pinning on non world models.
<br /><br />thinking about it, I`ll probably still use just a couple of pins on the game world models but only so I don`t have to scale, rotate and align the uv maps each time I use lscm to unwrap the model, but I don`t intend to tweak their uv`s by hand.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157991" date="Posted: Sun Sep 24, 2006 7:27 am "><author>kit89</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I'd suggest looking at this tutorial.

<br /><br />either way I would appreciate seeing how you or anyone else would do the seams on models like this, as I accept I`ve still things to learn with modeling <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img215.imageshack.us/my.php?image=image423yk4.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img215.imageshack.us/img215/9100/image423yk4.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a></div>

						<div class="postbody">zombie13, sorry it took so long, but I`ve just tested inline 1 on a couple of my .ase models.
<br /><br />if there is any vertex colors like the black to white fades we use to control texture blends, then it changes the some of the white to greens or blues, which I can`t see where they are coming from since my rock texture and the d3 dirt I was using don`t appear to have either of those colors in them.
<br /><br />I also tested the "textures/common/collision" material on some of my .ase models and it doesn`t seem to clip the player or their weapon projectiles, but some of d3`s clip materials did work, also doing a window context search of the original d3 mapobjects resulted in only .lwo models to use the collision material.</div>

						<div class="postbody">OK, I had some serious trouble with that. After spending much more time wrestling with blender than pushing uvs, here we go:
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://members.westnet.com.au/GeoffGole/temp/ratty_terrain05_03_REUNWRAPPED.blend">http://members.westnet.com.au/GeoffGole ... PPED.blend</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />I suggest that you append the object from this file rather than just opening the .blend, since it's not likely you want all my wierd settings. (Putting user interface settings in the same file as mesh data is pretty stupid). Some stuff has been ripped out to make it easier for me to work with the mesh, but don't worry about that - just take a look at the seam placement and uv layout.
<br /><br />First thing to notice is that I don't just use long, continuous seams but also some short one-ended cuts. That allows lcsm to push uvs over those seams, which helps relax stretching. In a few spots that results in mapping that is not 1 to 1, but that shouldn't be a problem when you are using an existing world texture (it's a big nono if your uvs will be used for baking/lightmapping/painting though, keep that in mind). I pushed those spots to where I thought they would be difficult to see - without knowing what your lighting and mesh position is going to be in game it's a bit difficult to know, so you'll want to make that kind of decision for yourself.
<br /><br />Secondly, the unwrapping here is pin-free and based entirely on the cuts that I've made. The only change is that the resulting uvset has been rotated and scaled a bit. If you want to play with the seam layout, just add more and unwrap again.
<br /><br />Lastly, if I was modelling this myself I'd give some thought to other methods of getting rid of seams. There's a big nasty one down the middle of the bottom of this mesh, maybe I'd move that one to where I know there'll be shadows or model a boulder to go on top of it. You pointed out yourself that you could arrange for seams to go where you've blended in the dirt texture, that would be worth looking at. You could also add another crack on the other side of the bridge, as those are perfect spots to hide seams.</div>

						<div class="postbody">thanks black dog and this is very interesting <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />firstly I didn`t know we could have seams that weren`t continuous edge loops. also great idea to hide the seams in cracks, I think I can do that quite easily from now on, and a few more beveled cracks will make the rocks look more interesting. and as you also suggested, covering them up with other models like boulders.
<br /><br />I might still use the odd pin, but I think your method will save me a lot of time in the future, as my uv maps were getting messed up a lot each time I added in more polys like the cracks, because the excessive pinning I was using was restricting the uv map from automatically shifting around while doing a lscm to compensate for the new polys uv`s.
<br /><br />so was this the first time you`ve used blender or was it just my .blend file that caused you problems? either way, I very much appreciate the time you spent on helping me with this <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />did you know we can use the file browser and deselect the "load ui" button at the bottom of the file browser?
<br /><br />this means that each blender user can retain their user prefs but load in other users project data (mesh, textures, materials etc) although some of the global prefs, like the paths blender looks for textures, are saved into the .b.blend file. although even that can be backed up or over written with global prefs for different projects we might be working on.
<br /><br />I do agree though it did seem stupid at first that blender saves some user prefs into the .blend project files, but I`ve got used to it.
<br /><br />which is the main modeling app you use?</div>

						<div class="postbody">understood black dog, and I hope I didn`t sound patronizing when telling you about "load ui" button?
<br /><br />I`m now using blender more then any other editor, but every week I learn something new about it or realize the potential of a feature I vaguely knew about previously. if users can get past the very steep learning curve of its interface, then it`s amazing how feature packed it is, would you agree?
<br /><br />I`ll try to not use pinning for my world models, but at least it is something I can fall back on if I struggle with the seams.
<br /><br />am I right in thinking that as long as they are well placed and hidden we could have many seams on a model, especially the one ended type, and the result would still be neat looking uv map, so instead of adding in more pins as I have been doing I add in more seams, yes?</div>

<br /><br />Blender is certainly full of stuff to learn. The thing is, I have no need for most of it and I'm more interested in learning to make assets than learning Blender. My focus is entirely on modelling and unwrapping and as such dealing with the complexities of the rendering or materials systems just isn't appealing. Out of all the clever things that got added in 2.42, for instance, the only ones I have real use for are the uvlayout export (decent at last!) and the very useful merge to target vertex. Now they just need to make the knife tool snap to the grid.
<br /><br />While it's possible to have many seams on a model, I don't know that more is always better. The idea is simply to have the surface look as contiguous as possible without stretching, ideally using as few seams as possible. Learning how to do that effectively is really just a matter of unwrapping a few models and seeing what works.</div>

<br /><br />thanks kit89, and I had already been using "lscm live transform" which is a lot better then lscm on it`s own, if we intend to then tweak the uv`s by hand, but I now think black dog`s suggestion of first making more efficient seams on these game world models, will be the most time saving method, although I`ll still be using lscm live and pinning on non world models.
<br /><br />thinking about it, I`ll probably still use just a couple of pins on the game world models but only so I don`t have to scale, rotate and align the uv maps each time I use lscm to unwrap the model, but I don`t intend to tweak their uv`s by hand.</div>

<br /><br />thanks blackdog, and I could ul the model`s .blend file if you have blender or perhaps export it to a format your modeling app can use?
<br /><br />either way I would appreciate seeing how you or anyone else would do the seams on models like this, as I accept I`ve still things to learn with modeling <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img215.imageshack.us/my.php?image=image423yk4.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img215.imageshack.us/img215/9100/image423yk4.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a></div>]]></body></post><post id="p157825" date="Posted: Fri Sep 22, 2006 9:52 pm "><author>Black Dog</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Sure, .blend is fine for me.

<br /><br />if there is any vertex colors like the black to white fades we use to control texture blends, then it changes the some of the white to greens or blues, which I can`t see where they are coming from since my rock texture and the d3 dirt I was using don`t appear to have either of those colors in them.
<br /><br />I also tested the "textures/common/collision" material on some of my .ase models and it doesn`t seem to clip the player or their weapon projectiles, but some of d3`s clip materials did work, also doing a window context search of the original d3 mapobjects resulted in only .lwo models to use the collision material.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157851" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 4:17 am "><author>Black Dog</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">"Native" exporters break all the time in blender.

After spending much more time wrestling with blender than pushing uvs, here we go:
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://members.westnet.com.au/GeoffGole/temp/ratty_terrain05_03_REUNWRAPPED.blend">http://members.westnet.com.au/GeoffGole ... PPED.blend</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />I suggest that you append the object from this file rather than just opening the .blend, since it's not likely you want all my wierd settings. (Putting user interface settings in the same file as mesh data is pretty stupid). Some stuff has been ripped out to make it easier for me to work with the mesh, but don't worry about that - just take a look at the seam placement and uv layout.
<br /><br />First thing to notice is that I don't just use long, continuous seams but also some short one-ended cuts. That allows lcsm to push uvs over those seams, which helps relax stretching. In a few spots that results in mapping that is not 1 to 1, but that shouldn't be a problem when you are using an existing world texture (it's a big nono if your uvs will be used for baking/lightmapping/painting though, keep that in mind). I pushed those spots to where I thought they would be difficult to see - without knowing what your lighting and mesh position is going to be in game it's a bit difficult to know, so you'll want to make that kind of decision for yourself.
<br /><br />Secondly, the unwrapping here is pin-free and based entirely on the cuts that I've made. The only change is that the resulting uvset has been rotated and scaled a bit. If you want to play with the seam layout, just add more and unwrap again.
<br /><br />Lastly, if I was modelling this myself I'd give some thought to other methods of getting rid of seams. There's a big nasty one down the middle of the bottom of this mesh, maybe I'd move that one to where I know there'll be shadows or model a boulder to go on top of it. You pointed out yourself that you could arrange for seams to go where you've blended in the dirt texture, that would be worth looking at. You could also add another crack on the other side of the bridge, as those are perfect spots to hide seams.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157858" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 6:06 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">thanks black dog and this is very interesting <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />firstly I didn`t know we could have seams that weren`t continuous edge loops. also great idea to hide the seams in cracks, I think I can do that quite easily from now on, and a few more beveled cracks will make the rocks look more interesting. and as you also suggested, covering them up with other models like boulders.
<br /><br />I might still use the odd pin, but I think your method will save me a lot of time in the future, as my uv maps were getting messed up a lot each time I added in more polys like the cracks, because the excessive pinning I was using was restricting the uv map from automatically shifting around while doing a lscm to compensate for the new polys uv`s.
<br /><br />so was this the first time you`ve used blender or was it just my .blend file that caused you problems? either way, I very much appreciate the time you spent on helping me with this <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />did you know we can use the file browser and deselect the "load ui" button at the bottom of the file browser?
<br /><br />this means that each blender user can retain their user prefs but load in other users project data (mesh, textures, materials etc) although some of the global prefs, like the paths blender looks for textures, are saved into the .b.blend file. although even that can be backed up or over written with global prefs for different projects we might be working on.
<br /><br />I do agree though it did seem stupid at first that blender saves some user prefs into the .blend project files, but I`ve got used to it.
<br /><br />which is the main modeling app you use?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157864" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 7:08 am "><author>Black Dog</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I use blender extensively, but rather narrowly.

<br /><br />I did know that there was an option not to load the ui, just couldn't remember where the hell it was. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I might still use the odd pin, but I think your method will save me a lot of time in the future, as my uv maps were getting messed up a lot each time I added in more polys like the cracks, because the excessive pinning I was using was restricting the uv map from automatically shifting around while doing a lscm to compensate for the new polys uv`s.</div>
<br /><br />That's the main disadvantage of pinning.

<br /><br />I`m now using blender more then any other editor, but every week I learn something new about it or realize the potential of a feature I vaguely knew about previously. if users can get past the very steep learning curve of its interface, then it`s amazing how feature packed it is, would you agree?
<br /><br />I`ll try to not use pinning for my world models, but at least it is something I can fall back on if I struggle with the seams.
<br /><br />am I right in thinking that as long as they are well placed and hidden we could have many seams on a model, especially the one ended type, and the result would still be neat looking uv map, so instead of adding in more pins as I have been doing I add in more seams, yes?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157914" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 8:22 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I haven`t done any of the new uv mapping, so this image is just of blender`s solid view mode, but it shows the rock bridge meshes spanning across the main cave.

<br /><br />Blender is certainly full of stuff to learn. The thing is, I have no need for most of it and I'm more interested in learning to make assets than learning Blender. My focus is entirely on modelling and unwrapping and as such dealing with the complexities of the rendering or materials systems just isn't appealing. Out of all the clever things that got added in 2.42, for instance, the only ones I have real use for are the uvlayout export (decent at last!) and the very useful merge to target vertex. Now they just need to make the knife tool snap to the grid.
<br /><br />While it's possible to have many seams on a model, I don't know that more is always better. The idea is simply to have the surface look as contiguous as possible without stretching, ideally using as few seams as possible. Learning how to do that effectively is really just a matter of unwrapping a few models and seeing what works.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157962" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 5:16 pm "><author>kit89</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Looking Good Ratty. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />When it comes to UV-mapping in Blender I suggest you try the "Live UnWrap Transform" feature.

<br /><br />thanks kit89, and I had already been using "lscm live transform" which is a lot better then lscm on it`s own, if we intend to then tweak the uv`s by hand, but I now think black dog`s suggestion of first making more efficient seams on these game world models, will be the most time saving method, although I`ll still be using lscm live and pinning on non world models.
<br /><br />thinking about it, I`ll probably still use just a couple of pins on the game world models but only so I don`t have to scale, rotate and align the uv maps each time I use lscm to unwrap the model, but I don`t intend to tweak their uv`s by hand.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157991" date="Posted: Sun Sep 24, 2006 7:27 am "><author>kit89</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I'd suggest looking at this tutorial.

						<div class="postbody">zombie13, sorry it took so long, but I`ve just tested inline 1 on a couple of my .ase models.
<br /><br />if there is any vertex colors like the black to white fades we use to control texture blends, then it changes the some of the white to greens or blues, which I can`t see where they are coming from since my rock texture and the d3 dirt I was using don`t appear to have either of those colors in them.
<br /><br />I also tested the "textures/common/collision" material on some of my .ase models and it doesn`t seem to clip the player or their weapon projectiles, but some of d3`s clip materials did work, also doing a window context search of the original d3 mapobjects resulted in only .lwo models to use the collision material.</div>

						<div class="postbody">OK, I had some serious trouble with that. After spending much more time wrestling with blender than pushing uvs, here we go:
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://members.westnet.com.au/GeoffGole/temp/ratty_terrain05_03_REUNWRAPPED.blend">http://members.westnet.com.au/GeoffGole ... PPED.blend</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />I suggest that you append the object from this file rather than just opening the .blend, since it's not likely you want all my wierd settings. (Putting user interface settings in the same file as mesh data is pretty stupid). Some stuff has been ripped out to make it easier for me to work with the mesh, but don't worry about that - just take a look at the seam placement and uv layout.
<br /><br />First thing to notice is that I don't just use long, continuous seams but also some short one-ended cuts. That allows lcsm to push uvs over those seams, which helps relax stretching. In a few spots that results in mapping that is not 1 to 1, but that shouldn't be a problem when you are using an existing world texture (it's a big nono if your uvs will be used for baking/lightmapping/painting though, keep that in mind). I pushed those spots to where I thought they would be difficult to see - without knowing what your lighting and mesh position is going to be in game it's a bit difficult to know, so you'll want to make that kind of decision for yourself.
<br /><br />Secondly, the unwrapping here is pin-free and based entirely on the cuts that I've made. The only change is that the resulting uvset has been rotated and scaled a bit. If you want to play with the seam layout, just add more and unwrap again.
<br /><br />Lastly, if I was modelling this myself I'd give some thought to other methods of getting rid of seams. There's a big nasty one down the middle of the bottom of this mesh, maybe I'd move that one to where I know there'll be shadows or model a boulder to go on top of it. You pointed out yourself that you could arrange for seams to go where you've blended in the dirt texture, that would be worth looking at. You could also add another crack on the other side of the bridge, as those are perfect spots to hide seams.</div>

						<div class="postbody">thanks black dog and this is very interesting <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />firstly I didn`t know we could have seams that weren`t continuous edge loops. also great idea to hide the seams in cracks, I think I can do that quite easily from now on, and a few more beveled cracks will make the rocks look more interesting. and as you also suggested, covering them up with other models like boulders.
<br /><br />I might still use the odd pin, but I think your method will save me a lot of time in the future, as my uv maps were getting messed up a lot each time I added in more polys like the cracks, because the excessive pinning I was using was restricting the uv map from automatically shifting around while doing a lscm to compensate for the new polys uv`s.
<br /><br />so was this the first time you`ve used blender or was it just my .blend file that caused you problems? either way, I very much appreciate the time you spent on helping me with this <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />did you know we can use the file browser and deselect the "load ui" button at the bottom of the file browser?
<br /><br />this means that each blender user can retain their user prefs but load in other users project data (mesh, textures, materials etc) although some of the global prefs, like the paths blender looks for textures, are saved into the .b.blend file. although even that can be backed up or over written with global prefs for different projects we might be working on.
<br /><br />I do agree though it did seem stupid at first that blender saves some user prefs into the .blend project files, but I`ve got used to it.
<br /><br />which is the main modeling app you use?</div>

						<div class="postbody">understood black dog, and I hope I didn`t sound patronizing when telling you about "load ui" button?
<br /><br />I`m now using blender more then any other editor, but every week I learn something new about it or realize the potential of a feature I vaguely knew about previously. if users can get past the very steep learning curve of its interface, then it`s amazing how feature packed it is, would you agree?
<br /><br />I`ll try to not use pinning for my world models, but at least it is something I can fall back on if I struggle with the seams.
<br /><br />am I right in thinking that as long as they are well placed and hidden we could have many seams on a model, especially the one ended type, and the result would still be neat looking uv map, so instead of adding in more pins as I have been doing I add in more seams, yes?</div>

<br /><br />Blender is certainly full of stuff to learn. The thing is, I have no need for most of it and I'm more interested in learning to make assets than learning Blender. My focus is entirely on modelling and unwrapping and as such dealing with the complexities of the rendering or materials systems just isn't appealing. Out of all the clever things that got added in 2.42, for instance, the only ones I have real use for are the uvlayout export (decent at last!) and the very useful merge to target vertex. Now they just need to make the knife tool snap to the grid.
<br /><br />While it's possible to have many seams on a model, I don't know that more is always better. The idea is simply to have the surface look as contiguous as possible without stretching, ideally using as few seams as possible. Learning how to do that effectively is really just a matter of unwrapping a few models and seeing what works.</div>

<br /><br />thanks kit89, and I had already been using "lscm live transform" which is a lot better then lscm on it`s own, if we intend to then tweak the uv`s by hand, but I now think black dog`s suggestion of first making more efficient seams on these game world models, will be the most time saving method, although I`ll still be using lscm live and pinning on non world models.
<br /><br />thinking about it, I`ll probably still use just a couple of pins on the game world models but only so I don`t have to scale, rotate and align the uv maps each time I use lscm to unwrap the model, but I don`t intend to tweak their uv`s by hand.</div>

<br /><br />I also tested the "textures/common/collision" material on some of my .ase models and it doesn`t seem to clip the player or their weapon projectiles, but some of d3`s clip materials did work, also doing a window context search of the original d3 mapobjects resulted in only .lwo models to use the collision material.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157851" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 4:17 am "><author>Black Dog</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">"Native" exporters break all the time in blender.

After spending much more time wrestling with blender than pushing uvs, here we go:
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://members.westnet.com.au/GeoffGole/temp/ratty_terrain05_03_REUNWRAPPED.blend">http://members.westnet.com.au/GeoffGole ... PPED.blend</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />I suggest that you append the object from this file rather than just opening the .blend, since it's not likely you want all my wierd settings. (Putting user interface settings in the same file as mesh data is pretty stupid). Some stuff has been ripped out to make it easier for me to work with the mesh, but don't worry about that - just take a look at the seam placement and uv layout.
<br /><br />First thing to notice is that I don't just use long, continuous seams but also some short one-ended cuts. That allows lcsm to push uvs over those seams, which helps relax stretching. In a few spots that results in mapping that is not 1 to 1, but that shouldn't be a problem when you are using an existing world texture (it's a big nono if your uvs will be used for baking/lightmapping/painting though, keep that in mind). I pushed those spots to where I thought they would be difficult to see - without knowing what your lighting and mesh position is going to be in game it's a bit difficult to know, so you'll want to make that kind of decision for yourself.
<br /><br />Secondly, the unwrapping here is pin-free and based entirely on the cuts that I've made. The only change is that the resulting uvset has been rotated and scaled a bit. If you want to play with the seam layout, just add more and unwrap again.
<br /><br />Lastly, if I was modelling this myself I'd give some thought to other methods of getting rid of seams. There's a big nasty one down the middle of the bottom of this mesh, maybe I'd move that one to where I know there'll be shadows or model a boulder to go on top of it. You pointed out yourself that you could arrange for seams to go where you've blended in the dirt texture, that would be worth looking at. You could also add another crack on the other side of the bridge, as those are perfect spots to hide seams.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157858" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 6:06 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">thanks black dog and this is very interesting <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />firstly I didn`t know we could have seams that weren`t continuous edge loops. also great idea to hide the seams in cracks, I think I can do that quite easily from now on, and a few more beveled cracks will make the rocks look more interesting. and as you also suggested, covering them up with other models like boulders.
<br /><br />I might still use the odd pin, but I think your method will save me a lot of time in the future, as my uv maps were getting messed up a lot each time I added in more polys like the cracks, because the excessive pinning I was using was restricting the uv map from automatically shifting around while doing a lscm to compensate for the new polys uv`s.
<br /><br />so was this the first time you`ve used blender or was it just my .blend file that caused you problems? either way, I very much appreciate the time you spent on helping me with this <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />did you know we can use the file browser and deselect the "load ui" button at the bottom of the file browser?
<br /><br />this means that each blender user can retain their user prefs but load in other users project data (mesh, textures, materials etc) although some of the global prefs, like the paths blender looks for textures, are saved into the .b.blend file. although even that can be backed up or over written with global prefs for different projects we might be working on.
<br /><br />I do agree though it did seem stupid at first that blender saves some user prefs into the .blend project files, but I`ve got used to it.
<br /><br />which is the main modeling app you use?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157864" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 7:08 am "><author>Black Dog</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I use blender extensively, but rather narrowly.

<br /><br />I`m now using blender more then any other editor, but every week I learn something new about it or realize the potential of a feature I vaguely knew about previously. if users can get past the very steep learning curve of its interface, then it`s amazing how feature packed it is, would you agree?
<br /><br />I`ll try to not use pinning for my world models, but at least it is something I can fall back on if I struggle with the seams.
<br /><br />am I right in thinking that as long as they are well placed and hidden we could have many seams on a model, especially the one ended type, and the result would still be neat looking uv map, so instead of adding in more pins as I have been doing I add in more seams, yes?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157914" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 8:22 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I haven`t done any of the new uv mapping, so this image is just of blender`s solid view mode, but it shows the rock bridge meshes spanning across the main cave.

<br /><br />Blender is certainly full of stuff to learn. The thing is, I have no need for most of it and I'm more interested in learning to make assets than learning Blender. My focus is entirely on modelling and unwrapping and as such dealing with the complexities of the rendering or materials systems just isn't appealing. Out of all the clever things that got added in 2.42, for instance, the only ones I have real use for are the uvlayout export (decent at last!) and the very useful merge to target vertex. Now they just need to make the knife tool snap to the grid.
<br /><br />While it's possible to have many seams on a model, I don't know that more is always better. The idea is simply to have the surface look as contiguous as possible without stretching, ideally using as few seams as possible. Learning how to do that effectively is really just a matter of unwrapping a few models and seeing what works.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157962" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 5:16 pm "><author>kit89</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Looking Good Ratty. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />When it comes to UV-mapping in Blender I suggest you try the "Live UnWrap Transform" feature.

<br /><br />thanks kit89, and I had already been using "lscm live transform" which is a lot better then lscm on it`s own, if we intend to then tweak the uv`s by hand, but I now think black dog`s suggestion of first making more efficient seams on these game world models, will be the most time saving method, although I`ll still be using lscm live and pinning on non world models.
<br /><br />thinking about it, I`ll probably still use just a couple of pins on the game world models but only so I don`t have to scale, rotate and align the uv maps each time I use lscm to unwrap the model, but I don`t intend to tweak their uv`s by hand.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157991" date="Posted: Sun Sep 24, 2006 7:27 am "><author>kit89</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I'd suggest looking at this tutorial.

						<div class="postbody">zombie13, sorry it took so long, but I`ve just tested inline 1 on a couple of my .ase models.
<br /><br />if there is any vertex colors like the black to white fades we use to control texture blends, then it changes the some of the white to greens or blues, which I can`t see where they are coming from since my rock texture and the d3 dirt I was using don`t appear to have either of those colors in them.
<br /><br />I also tested the "textures/common/collision" material on some of my .ase models and it doesn`t seem to clip the player or their weapon projectiles, but some of d3`s clip materials did work, also doing a window context search of the original d3 mapobjects resulted in only .lwo models to use the collision material.</div>

						<div class="postbody">OK, I had some serious trouble with that. After spending much more time wrestling with blender than pushing uvs, here we go:
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://members.westnet.com.au/GeoffGole/temp/ratty_terrain05_03_REUNWRAPPED.blend">http://members.westnet.com.au/GeoffGole ... PPED.blend</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />I suggest that you append the object from this file rather than just opening the .blend, since it's not likely you want all my wierd settings. (Putting user interface settings in the same file as mesh data is pretty stupid). Some stuff has been ripped out to make it easier for me to work with the mesh, but don't worry about that - just take a look at the seam placement and uv layout.
<br /><br />First thing to notice is that I don't just use long, continuous seams but also some short one-ended cuts. That allows lcsm to push uvs over those seams, which helps relax stretching. In a few spots that results in mapping that is not 1 to 1, but that shouldn't be a problem when you are using an existing world texture (it's a big nono if your uvs will be used for baking/lightmapping/painting though, keep that in mind). I pushed those spots to where I thought they would be difficult to see - without knowing what your lighting and mesh position is going to be in game it's a bit difficult to know, so you'll want to make that kind of decision for yourself.
<br /><br />Secondly, the unwrapping here is pin-free and based entirely on the cuts that I've made. The only change is that the resulting uvset has been rotated and scaled a bit. If you want to play with the seam layout, just add more and unwrap again.
<br /><br />Lastly, if I was modelling this myself I'd give some thought to other methods of getting rid of seams. There's a big nasty one down the middle of the bottom of this mesh, maybe I'd move that one to where I know there'll be shadows or model a boulder to go on top of it. You pointed out yourself that you could arrange for seams to go where you've blended in the dirt texture, that would be worth looking at. You could also add another crack on the other side of the bridge, as those are perfect spots to hide seams.</div>

						<div class="postbody">thanks black dog and this is very interesting <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />firstly I didn`t know we could have seams that weren`t continuous edge loops. also great idea to hide the seams in cracks, I think I can do that quite easily from now on, and a few more beveled cracks will make the rocks look more interesting. and as you also suggested, covering them up with other models like boulders.
<br /><br />I might still use the odd pin, but I think your method will save me a lot of time in the future, as my uv maps were getting messed up a lot each time I added in more polys like the cracks, because the excessive pinning I was using was restricting the uv map from automatically shifting around while doing a lscm to compensate for the new polys uv`s.
<br /><br />so was this the first time you`ve used blender or was it just my .blend file that caused you problems? either way, I very much appreciate the time you spent on helping me with this <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />did you know we can use the file browser and deselect the "load ui" button at the bottom of the file browser?
<br /><br />this means that each blender user can retain their user prefs but load in other users project data (mesh, textures, materials etc) although some of the global prefs, like the paths blender looks for textures, are saved into the .b.blend file. although even that can be backed up or over written with global prefs for different projects we might be working on.
<br /><br />I do agree though it did seem stupid at first that blender saves some user prefs into the .blend project files, but I`ve got used to it.
<br /><br />which is the main modeling app you use?</div>

						<div class="postbody">understood black dog, and I hope I didn`t sound patronizing when telling you about "load ui" button?
<br /><br />I`m now using blender more then any other editor, but every week I learn something new about it or realize the potential of a feature I vaguely knew about previously. if users can get past the very steep learning curve of its interface, then it`s amazing how feature packed it is, would you agree?
<br /><br />I`ll try to not use pinning for my world models, but at least it is something I can fall back on if I struggle with the seams.
<br /><br />am I right in thinking that as long as they are well placed and hidden we could have many seams on a model, especially the one ended type, and the result would still be neat looking uv map, so instead of adding in more pins as I have been doing I add in more seams, yes?</div>

<br /><br />Blender is certainly full of stuff to learn. The thing is, I have no need for most of it and I'm more interested in learning to make assets than learning Blender. My focus is entirely on modelling and unwrapping and as such dealing with the complexities of the rendering or materials systems just isn't appealing. Out of all the clever things that got added in 2.42, for instance, the only ones I have real use for are the uvlayout export (decent at last!) and the very useful merge to target vertex. Now they just need to make the knife tool snap to the grid.
<br /><br />While it's possible to have many seams on a model, I don't know that more is always better. The idea is simply to have the surface look as contiguous as possible without stretching, ideally using as few seams as possible. Learning how to do that effectively is really just a matter of unwrapping a few models and seeing what works.</div>

<br /><br />thanks kit89, and I had already been using "lscm live transform" which is a lot better then lscm on it`s own, if we intend to then tweak the uv`s by hand, but I now think black dog`s suggestion of first making more efficient seams on these game world models, will be the most time saving method, although I`ll still be using lscm live and pinning on non world models.
<br /><br />thinking about it, I`ll probably still use just a couple of pins on the game world models but only so I don`t have to scale, rotate and align the uv maps each time I use lscm to unwrap the model, but I don`t intend to tweak their uv`s by hand.</div>

After spending much more time wrestling with blender than pushing uvs, here we go:&#13;
<br/><br/><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://members.westnet.com.au/GeoffGole/temp/ratty_terrain05_03_REUNWRAPPED.blend" target="_blank">http://members.westnet.com.au/GeoffGole/temp/ratty_terrain05_03_REUNWRAPPED.blend</a>&#13;
<br/><br/>
I suggest that you append the object from this file rather than just opening the .blend, since it's not likely you want all my wierd settings. (Putting user interface settings in the same file as mesh data is pretty stupid). Some stuff has been ripped out to make it easier for me to work with the mesh, but don't worry about that - just take a look at the seam placement and uv layout.&#13;
<br/><br/>
First thing to notice is that I don't just use long, continuous seams but also some short one-ended cuts. That allows lcsm to push uvs over those seams, which helps relax stretching. In a few spots that results in mapping that is not 1 to 1, but that shouldn't be a problem when you are using an existing world texture (it's a big nono if your uvs will be used for baking/lightmapping/painting though, keep that in mind). I pushed those spots to where I thought they would be difficult to see - without knowing what your lighting and mesh position is going to be in game it's a bit difficult to know, so you'll want to make that kind of decision for yourself.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Secondly, the unwrapping here is pin-free and based entirely on the cuts that I've made. The only change is that the resulting uvset has been rotated and scaled a bit. If you want to play with the seam layout, just add more and unwrap again.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Lastly, if I was modelling this myself I'd give some thought to other methods of getting rid of seams. There's a big nasty one down the middle of the bottom of this mesh, maybe I'd move that one to where I know there'll be shadows or model a boulder to go on top of it. You pointed out yourself that you could arrange for seams to go where you've blended in the dirt texture, that would be worth looking at. You could also add another crack on the other side of the bridge, as those are perfect spots to hide seams.</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

firstly I didn`t know we could have seams that weren`t continuous edge loops. also great idea to hide the seams in cracks, I think I can do that quite easily from now on, and a few more beveled cracks will make the rocks look more interesting. and as you also suggested, covering them up with other models like boulders.&#13;
<br/><br/>
I might still use the odd pin, but I think your method will save me a lot of time in the future, as my uv maps were getting messed up a lot each time I added in more polys like the cracks, because the excessive pinning I was using was restricting the uv map from automatically shifting around while doing a lscm to compensate for the new polys uv`s.&#13;
<br/><br/>
so was this the first time you`ve used blender or was it just my .blend file that caused you problems? either way, I very much appreciate the time you spent on helping me with this <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0"/><br/><br/>
did you know we can use the file browser and deselect the "load ui" button at the bottom of the file browser?&#13;
<br/><br/>
this means that each blender user can retain their user prefs but load in other users project data (mesh, textures, materials etc) although some of the global prefs, like the paths blender looks for textures, are saved into the .b.blend file. although even that can be backed up or over written with global prefs for different projects we might be working on.&#13;
<br/><br/>
I do agree though it did seem stupid at first that blender saves some user prefs into the .blend project files, but I`ve got used to it.&#13;
<br/><br/>

Blender is certainly full of stuff to learn. The thing is, I have no need for most of it and I'm more interested in learning to make assets than learning Blender. My focus is entirely on modelling and unwrapping and as such dealing with the complexities of the rendering or materials systems just isn't appealing. Out of all the clever things that got added

Out of all the clever things that got added in 2.42, for instance, the only ones I have real use for are the uvlayout export (decent at last!) and the very useful merge to target vertex. Now they just need to make the knife tool snap to the grid.
<br /><br />While it's possible to have many seams on a model, I don't know that more is always better. The idea is simply to have the surface look as contiguous as possible without stretching, ideally using as few seams as possible.

This allows the skin to change as you move pinned faces making it very flexible to modify skins effectively. Although it wont move pinned faces so its best to have maybe 4 or 5 pins.

The idea is simply to have the surface look as contiguous as possible without stretching, ideally using as few seams as possible. Learning how to do that effectively is really just a matter of unwrapping a few models and seeing what works. </div><br /><br />understood and thanks <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">kit89 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"> Looking Good Ratty.  <br /><br />When it comes to UV-mapping in Blender I suggest you try the "Live UnWrap Transform" feature. This allows the skin to change as you move pinned faces making it very flexible to modify skins effectively. Although it wont move pinned faces so its best to have maybe 4 or 5 pins. <br /><br />Depending on the size you could just leave the standard uv-map (Each quad/tris uses the entire texture) although if its not a repeating texture it will look silly.. <br /><br />Cant wait to see more. </div>
<br /><br />thanks kit89, and I had already been using "lscm live transform" which is a lot better then lscm on it`s own, if we intend to then tweak the uv`s by hand, but I now think black dog`s suggestion of first making more efficient seams on these game world models, will be the most time saving method, although I`ll still be using lscm live and pinning on non world models.
<br /><br />thinking about it, I`ll probably still use just a couple of pins on the game world models but only so I don`t have to scale, rotate and align the uv maps each time I use lscm to unwrap the model, but I don`t intend to tweak their uv`s by hand.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157991" date="Posted: Sun Sep 24, 2006 7:27 am "><author>kit89</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I'd suggest looking at this tutorial.

						<div class="postbody">zombie13, sorry it took so long, but I`ve just tested inline 1 on a couple of my .ase models.
<br /><br />if there is any vertex colors like the black to white fades we use to control texture blends, then it changes the some of the white to greens or blues, which I can`t see where they are coming from since my rock texture and the d3 dirt I was using don`t appear to have either of those colors in them.
<br /><br />I also tested the "textures/common/collision" material on some of my .ase models and it doesn`t seem to clip the player or their weapon projectiles, but some of d3`s clip materials did work, also doing a window context search of the original d3 mapobjects resulted in only .lwo models to use the collision material.</div>

						<div class="postbody">OK, I had some serious trouble with that. After spending much more time wrestling with blender than pushing uvs, here we go:
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://members.westnet.com.au/GeoffGole/temp/ratty_terrain05_03_REUNWRAPPED.blend">http://members.westnet.com.au/GeoffGole ... PPED.blend</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />I suggest that you append the object from this file rather than just opening the .blend, since it's not likely you want all my wierd settings. (Putting user interface settings in the same file as mesh data is pretty stupid). Some stuff has been ripped out to make it easier for me to work with the mesh, but don't worry about that - just take a look at the seam placement and uv layout.
<br /><br />First thing to notice is that I don't just use long, continuous seams but also some short one-ended cuts. That allows lcsm to push uvs over those seams, which helps relax stretching. In a few spots that results in mapping that is not 1 to 1, but that shouldn't be a problem when you are using an existing world texture (it's a big nono if your uvs will be used for baking/lightmapping/painting though, keep that in mind). I pushed those spots to where I thought they would be difficult to see - without knowing what your lighting and mesh position is going to be in game it's a bit difficult to know, so you'll want to make that kind of decision for yourself.
<br /><br />Secondly, the unwrapping here is pin-free and based entirely on the cuts that I've made. The only change is that the resulting uvset has been rotated and scaled a bit. If you want to play with the seam layout, just add more and unwrap again.
<br /><br />Lastly, if I was modelling this myself I'd give some thought to other methods of getting rid of seams. There's a big nasty one down the middle of the bottom of this mesh, maybe I'd move that one to where I know there'll be shadows or model a boulder to go on top of it. You pointed out yourself that you could arrange for seams to go where you've blended in the dirt texture, that would be worth looking at. You could also add another crack on the other side of the bridge, as those are perfect spots to hide seams.</div>

						<div class="postbody">thanks black dog and this is very interesting <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />firstly I didn`t know we could have seams that weren`t continuous edge loops. also great idea to hide the seams in cracks, I think I can do that quite easily from now on, and a few more beveled cracks will make the rocks look more interesting. and as you also suggested, covering them up with other models like boulders.
<br /><br />I might still use the odd pin, but I think your method will save me a lot of time in the future, as my uv maps were getting messed up a lot each time I added in more polys like the cracks, because the excessive pinning I was using was restricting the uv map from automatically shifting around while doing a lscm to compensate for the new polys uv`s.
<br /><br />so was this the first time you`ve used blender or was it just my .blend file that caused you problems? either way, I very much appreciate the time you spent on helping me with this <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />did you know we can use the file browser and deselect the "load ui" button at the bottom of the file browser?
<br /><br />this means that each blender user can retain their user prefs but load in other users project data (mesh, textures, materials etc) although some of the global prefs, like the paths blender looks for textures, are saved into the .b.blend file. although even that can be backed up or over written with global prefs for different projects we might be working on.
<br /><br />I do agree though it did seem stupid at first that blender saves some user prefs into the .blend project files, but I`ve got used to it.
<br /><br />which is the main modeling app you use?</div>

						<div class="postbody">understood black dog, and I hope I didn`t sound patronizing when telling you about "load ui" button?
<br /><br />I`m now using blender more then any other editor, but every week I learn something new about it or realize the potential of a feature I vaguely knew about previously. if users can get past the very steep learning curve of its interface, then it`s amazing how feature packed it is, would you agree?
<br /><br />I`ll try to not use pinning for my world models, but at least it is something I can fall back on if I struggle with the seams.
<br /><br />am I right in thinking that as long as they are well placed and hidden we could have many seams on a model, especially the one ended type, and the result would still be neat looking uv map, so instead of adding in more pins as I have been doing I add in more seams, yes?</div>

						<div class="postbody">Patronising, no. Please never hesitate to tell me useful stuff. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /> Maybe I already know it, maybe not.
<br /><br />Blender is certainly full of stuff to learn. The thing is, I have no need for most of it and I'm more interested in learning to make assets than learning Blender. My focus is entirely on modelling and unwrapping and as such dealing with the complexities of the rendering or materials systems just isn't appealing. Out of all the clever things that got added in 2.42, for instance, the only ones I have real use for are the uvlayout export (decent at last!) and the very useful merge to target vertex. Now they just need to make the knife tool snap to the grid.
<br /><br />While it's possible to have many seams on a model, I don't know that more is always better. The idea is simply to have the surface look as contiguous as possible without stretching, ideally using as few seams as possible. Learning how to do that effectively is really just a matter of unwrapping a few models and seeing what works.</div>

<br /><br />thanks kit89, and I had already been using "lscm live transform" which is a lot better then lscm on it`s own, if we intend to then tweak the uv`s by hand, but I now think black dog`s suggestion of first making more efficient seams on these game world models, will be the most time saving method, although I`ll still be using lscm live and pinning on non world models.
<br /><br />thinking about it, I`ll probably still use just a couple of pins on the game world models but only so I don`t have to scale, rotate and align the uv maps each time I use lscm to unwrap the model, but I don`t intend to tweak their uv`s by hand.</div>

After spending much more time wrestling with blender than pushing uvs, here we go:&#13;
<br/><br/><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://members.westnet.com.au/GeoffGole/temp/ratty_terrain05_03_REUNWRAPPED.blend" target="_blank">http://members.westnet.com.au/GeoffGole/temp/ratty_terrain05_03_REUNWRAPPED.blend</a>&#13;
<br/><br/>
I suggest that you append the object from this file rather than just opening the .blend, since it's not likely you want all my wierd settings. (Putting user interface settings in the same file as mesh data is pretty stupid). Some stuff has been ripped out to make it easier for me to work with the mesh, but don't worry about that - just take a look at the seam placement and uv layout.&#13;
<br/><br/>
First thing to notice is that I don't just use long, continuous seams but also some short one-ended cuts. That allows lcsm to push uvs over those seams, which helps relax stretching. In a few spots that results in mapping that is not 1 to 1, but that shouldn't be a problem when you are using an existing world texture (it's a big nono if your uvs will be used for baking/lightmapping/painting though, keep that in mind). I pushed those spots to where I thought they would be difficult to see - without knowing what your lighting and mesh position is going to be in game it's a bit difficult to know, so you'll want to make that kind of decision for yourself.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Secondly, the unwrapping here is pin-free and based entirely on the cuts that I've made. The only change is that the resulting uvset has been rotated and scaled a bit. If you want to play with the seam layout, just add more and unwrap again.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Lastly, if I was modelling this myself I'd give some thought to other methods of getting rid of seams. There's a big nasty one down the middle of the bottom of this mesh, maybe I'd move that one to where I know there'll be shadows or model a boulder to go on top of it. You pointed out yourself that you could arrange for seams to go where you've blended in the dirt texture, that would be worth looking at. You could also add another crack on the other side of the bridge, as those are perfect spots to hide seams.</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

firstly I didn`t know we could have seams that weren`t continuous edge loops. also great idea to hide the seams in cracks, I think I can do that quite easily from now on, and a few more beveled cracks will make the rocks look more interesting. and as you also suggested, covering them up with other models like boulders.&#13;
<br/><br/>
I might still use the odd pin, but I think your method will save me a lot of time in the future, as my uv maps were getting messed up a lot each time I added in more polys like the cracks, because the excessive pinning I was using was restricting the uv map from automatically shifting around while doing a lscm to compensate for the new polys uv`s.&#13;
<br/><br/>
so was this the first time you`ve used blender or was it just my .blend file that caused you problems? either way, I very much appreciate the time you spent on helping me with this <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0"/><br/><br/>
did you know we can use the file browser and deselect the "load ui" button at the bottom of the file browser?&#13;
<br/><br/>
this means that each blender user can retain their user prefs but load in other users project data (mesh, textures, materials etc) although some of the global prefs, like the paths blender looks for textures, are saved into the .b.blend file. although even that can be backed up or over written with global prefs for different projects we might be working on.&#13;
<br/><br/>
I do agree though it did seem stupid at first that blender saves some user prefs into the .blend project files, but I`ve got used to it.&#13;
<br/><br/>
which is the main modeling app you use?<br/>_________________<br/><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=17180&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=0" target="_blank" class="postlink">(wip) ratty d3 hell map</a>&#13;

That's the main disadvantage of pinning. From what I can tell it's a more useful feature when doing things like unwrapping a character model, but I rarely use it on world geometry.</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

I`m now using blender more then any other editor, but every week I learn something new about it or realize the potential of a feature I vaguely knew about previously. if users can get past the very steep learning curve of its interface, then it`s amazing how feature packed it is, would you agree?&#13;
<br/><br/>
I`ll try to not use pinning for my world models, but at least it is something I can fall back on if I struggle with the seams.&#13;
<br/><br/>
am I right in thinking that as long as they are well placed and hidden we could have many seams on a model, especially the one ended type, and the result would still be neat looking uv map, so instead of adding in more pins as I have been doing I add in more seams, yes?<br/>_________________<br/><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=17180&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=0" target="_blank" class="postlink">(wip) ratty d3 hell map</a>&#13;

<br /><br />either way I would appreciate seeing how you or anyone else would do the seams on models like this, as I accept I`ve still things to learn with modeling <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img215.imageshack.us/my.php?image=image423yk4.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img215.imageshack.us/img215/9100/image423yk4.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a></div>]]></body></post><post id="p157825" date="Posted: Fri Sep 22, 2006 9:52 pm "><author>Black Dog</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Sure, .blend is fine for me.

<br /><br />if there is any vertex colors like the black to white fades we use to control texture blends, then it changes the some of the white to greens or blues, which I can`t see where they are coming from since my rock texture and the d3 dirt I was using don`t appear to have either of those colors in them.
<br /><br />I also tested the "textures/common/collision" material on some of my .ase models and it doesn`t seem to clip the player or their weapon projectiles, but some of d3`s clip materials did work, also doing a window context search of the original d3 mapobjects resulted in only .lwo models to use the collision material.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157851" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 4:17 am "><author>Black Dog</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">"Native" exporters break all the time in blender.

After spending much more time wrestling with blender than pushing uvs, here we go:
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://members.westnet.com.au/GeoffGole/temp/ratty_terrain05_03_REUNWRAPPED.blend">http://members.westnet.com.au/GeoffGole ... PPED.blend</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />I suggest that you append the object from this file rather than just opening the .blend, since it's not likely you want all my wierd settings. (Putting user interface settings in the same file as mesh data is pretty stupid). Some stuff has been ripped out to make it easier for me to work with the mesh, but don't worry about that - just take a look at the seam placement and uv layout.
<br /><br />First thing to notice is that I don't just use long, continuous seams but also some short one-ended cuts. That allows lcsm to push uvs over those seams, which helps relax stretching. In a few spots that results in mapping that is not 1 to 1, but that shouldn't be a problem when you are using an existing world texture (it's a big nono if your uvs will be used for baking/lightmapping/painting though, keep that in mind). I pushed those spots to where I thought they would be difficult to see - without knowing what your lighting and mesh position is going to be in game it's a bit difficult to know, so you'll want to make that kind of decision for yourself.
<br /><br />Secondly, the unwrapping here is pin-free and based entirely on the cuts that I've made. The only change is that the resulting uvset has been rotated and scaled a bit. If you want to play with the seam layout, just add more and unwrap again.
<br /><br />Lastly, if I was modelling this myself I'd give some thought to other methods of getting rid of seams. There's a big nasty one down the middle of the bottom of this mesh, maybe I'd move that one to where I know there'll be shadows or model a boulder to go on top of it. You pointed out yourself that you could arrange for seams to go where you've blended in the dirt texture, that would be worth looking at. You could also add another crack on the other side of the bridge, as those are perfect spots to hide seams.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157858" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 6:06 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">thanks black dog and this is very interesting <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />firstly I didn`t know we could have seams that weren`t continuous edge loops. also great idea to hide the seams in cracks, I think I can do that quite easily from now on, and a few more beveled cracks will make the rocks look more interesting. and as you also suggested, covering them up with other models like boulders.
<br /><br />I might still use the odd pin, but I think your method will save me a lot of time in the future, as my uv maps were getting messed up a lot each time I added in more polys like the cracks, because the excessive pinning I was using was restricting the uv map from automatically shifting around while doing a lscm to compensate for the new polys uv`s.
<br /><br />so was this the first time you`ve used blender or was it just my .blend file that caused you problems? either way, I very much appreciate the time you spent on helping me with this <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />did you know we can use the file browser and deselect the "load ui" button at the bottom of the file browser?
<br /><br />this means that each blender user can retain their user prefs but load in other users project data (mesh, textures, materials etc) although some of the global prefs, like the paths blender looks for textures, are saved into the .b.blend file. although even that can be backed up or over written with global prefs for different projects we might be working on.
<br /><br />I do agree though it did seem stupid at first that blender saves some user prefs into the .blend project files, but I`ve got used to it.
<br /><br />which is the main modeling app you use?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157864" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 7:08 am "><author>Black Dog</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I use blender extensively, but rather narrowly.

<br /><br />That's the main disadvantage of pinning.

<br /><br />I`m now using blender more then any other editor, but every week I learn something new about it or realize the potential of a feature I vaguely knew about previously. if users can get past the very steep learning curve of its interface, then it`s amazing how feature packed it is, would you agree?
<br /><br />I`ll try to not use pinning for my world models, but at least it is something I can fall back on if I struggle with the seams.
<br /><br />am I right in thinking that as long as they are well placed and hidden we could have many seams on a model, especially the one ended type, and the result would still be neat looking uv map, so instead of adding in more pins as I have been doing I add in more seams, yes?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157914" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 8:22 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I haven`t done any of the new uv mapping, so this image is just of blender`s solid view mode, but it shows the rock bridge meshes spanning across the main cave.

<br /><br />Blender is certainly full of stuff to learn. The thing is, I have no need for most of it and I'm more interested in learning to make assets than learning Blender. My focus is entirely on modelling and unwrapping and as such dealing with the complexities of the rendering or materials systems just isn't appealing. Out of all the clever things that got added in 2.42, for instance, the only ones I have real use for are the uvlayout export (decent at last!) and the very useful merge to target vertex. Now they just need to make the knife tool snap to the grid.
<br /><br />While it's possible to have many seams on a model, I don't know that more is always better. The idea is simply to have the surface look as contiguous as possible without stretching, ideally using as few seams as possible. Learning how to do that effectively is really just a matter of unwrapping a few models and seeing what works.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157962" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 5:16 pm "><author>kit89</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Looking Good Ratty. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />When it comes to UV-mapping in Blender I suggest you try the "Live UnWrap Transform" feature.

<br /><br />thanks kit89, and I had already been using "lscm live transform" which is a lot better then lscm on it`s own, if we intend to then tweak the uv`s by hand, but I now think black dog`s suggestion of first making more efficient seams on these game world models, will be the most time saving method, although I`ll still be using lscm live and pinning on non world models.
<br /><br />thinking about it, I`ll probably still use just a couple of pins on the game world models but only so I don`t have to scale, rotate and align the uv maps each time I use lscm to unwrap the model, but I don`t intend to tweak their uv`s by hand.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157991" date="Posted: Sun Sep 24, 2006 7:27 am "><author>kit89</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I'd suggest looking at this tutorial.

<br /><br />thanks blackdog, and I could ul the model`s .blend file if you have blender or perhaps export it to a format your modeling app can use?
<br /><br />either way I would appreciate seeing how you or anyone else would do the seams on models like this, as I accept I`ve still things to learn with modeling <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img215.imageshack.us/my.php?image=image423yk4.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img215.imageshack.us/img215/9100/image423yk4.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a></div>

<br /><br />if there is any vertex colors like the black to white fades we use to control texture blends, then it changes the some of the white to greens or blues, which I can`t see where they are coming from since my rock texture and the d3 dirt I was using don`t appear to have either of those colors in them.
<br /><br />I also tested the "textures/common/collision" material on some of my .ase models and it doesn`t seem to clip the player or their weapon projectiles, but some of d3`s clip materials did work, also doing a window context search of the original d3 mapobjects resulted in only .lwo models to use the collision material.</div>

						<div class="postbody">OK, I had some serious trouble with that. After spending much more time wrestling with blender than pushing uvs, here we go:
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://members.westnet.com.au/GeoffGole/temp/ratty_terrain05_03_REUNWRAPPED.blend">http://members.westnet.com.au/GeoffGole ... PPED.blend</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />I suggest that you append the object from this file rather than just opening the .blend, since it's not likely you want all my wierd settings. (Putting user interface settings in the same file as mesh data is pretty stupid). Some stuff has been ripped out to make it easier for me to work with the mesh, but don't worry about that - just take a look at the seam placement and uv layout.
<br /><br />First thing to notice is that I don't just use long, continuous seams but also some short one-ended cuts. That allows lcsm to push uvs over those seams, which helps relax stretching. In a few spots that results in mapping that is not 1 to 1, but that shouldn't be a problem when you are using an existing world texture (it's a big nono if your uvs will be used for baking/lightmapping/painting though, keep that in mind). I pushed those spots to where I thought they would be difficult to see - without knowing what your lighting and mesh position is going to be in game it's a bit difficult to know, so you'll want to make that kind of decision for yourself.
<br /><br />Secondly, the unwrapping here is pin-free and based entirely on the cuts that I've made. The only change is that the resulting uvset has been rotated and scaled a bit. If you want to play with the seam layout, just add more and unwrap again.
<br /><br />Lastly, if I was modelling this myself I'd give some thought to other methods of getting rid of seams. There's a big nasty one down the middle of the bottom of this mesh, maybe I'd move that one to where I know there'll be shadows or model a boulder to go on top of it. You pointed out yourself that you could arrange for seams to go where you've blended in the dirt texture, that would be worth looking at. You could also add another crack on the other side of the bridge, as those are perfect spots to hide seams.</div>

						<div class="postbody">thanks black dog and this is very interesting <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />firstly I didn`t know we could have seams that weren`t continuous edge loops. also great idea to hide the seams in cracks, I think I can do that quite easily from now on, and a few more beveled cracks will make the rocks look more interesting. and as you also suggested, covering them up with other models like boulders.
<br /><br />I might still use the odd pin, but I think your method will save me a lot of time in the future, as my uv maps were getting messed up a lot each time I added in more polys like the cracks, because the excessive pinning I was using was restricting the uv map from automatically shifting around while doing a lscm to compensate for the new polys uv`s.
<br /><br />so was this the first time you`ve used blender or was it just my .blend file that caused you problems? either way, I very much appreciate the time you spent on helping me with this <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />did you know we can use the file browser and deselect the "load ui" button at the bottom of the file browser?
<br /><br />this means that each blender user can retain their user prefs but load in other users project data (mesh, textures, materials etc) although some of the global prefs, like the paths blender looks for textures, are saved into the .b.blend file. although even that can be backed up or over written with global prefs for different projects we might be working on.
<br /><br />I do agree though it did seem stupid at first that blender saves some user prefs into the .blend project files, but I`ve got used to it.
<br /><br />which is the main modeling app you use?</div>

						<div class="postbody">understood black dog, and I hope I didn`t sound patronizing when telling you about "load ui" button?
<br /><br />I`m now using blender more then any other editor, but every week I learn something new about it or realize the potential of a feature I vaguely knew about previously. if users can get past the very steep learning curve of its interface, then it`s amazing how feature packed it is, would you agree?
<br /><br />I`ll try to not use pinning for my world models, but at least it is something I can fall back on if I struggle with the seams.
<br /><br />am I right in thinking that as long as they are well placed and hidden we could have many seams on a model, especially the one ended type, and the result would still be neat looking uv map, so instead of adding in more pins as I have been doing I add in more seams, yes?</div>

<br /><br />Blender is certainly full of stuff to learn. The thing is, I have no need for most of it and I'm more interested in learning to make assets than learning Blender. My focus is entirely on modelling and unwrapping and as such dealing with the complexities of the rendering or materials systems just isn't appealing. Out of all the clever things that got added in 2.42, for instance, the only ones I have real use for are the uvlayout export (decent at last!) and the very useful merge to target vertex. Now they just need to make the knife tool snap to the grid.
<br /><br />While it's possible to have many seams on a model, I don't know that more is always better. The idea is simply to have the surface look as contiguous as possible without stretching, ideally using as few seams as possible. Learning how to do that effectively is really just a matter of unwrapping a few models and seeing what works.</div>

<br /><br />thanks kit89, and I had already been using "lscm live transform" which is a lot better then lscm on it`s own, if we intend to then tweak the uv`s by hand, but I now think black dog`s suggestion of first making more efficient seams on these game world models, will be the most time saving method, although I`ll still be using lscm live and pinning on non world models.
<br /><br />thinking about it, I`ll probably still use just a couple of pins on the game world models but only so I don`t have to scale, rotate and align the uv maps each time I use lscm to unwrap the model, but I don`t intend to tweak their uv`s by hand.</div>

After spending much more time wrestling with blender than pushing uvs, here we go:
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://members.westnet.com.au/GeoffGole/temp/ratty_terrain05_03_REUNWRAPPED.blend">http://members.westnet.com.au/GeoffGole ... PPED.blend</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />I suggest that you append the object from this file rather than just opening the .blend, since it's not likely you want all my wierd settings. (Putting user interface settings in the same file as mesh data is pretty stupid). Some stuff has been ripped out to make it easier for me to work with the mesh, but don't worry about that - just take a look at the seam placement and uv layout.
<br /><br />First thing to notice is that I don't just use long, continuous seams but also some short one-ended cuts. That allows lcsm to push uvs over those seams, which helps relax stretching. In a few spots that results in mapping that is not 1 to 1, but that shouldn't be a problem when you are using an existing world texture (it's a big nono if your uvs will be used for baking/lightmapping/painting though, keep that in mind). I pushed those spots to where I thought they would be difficult to see - without knowing what your lighting and mesh position is going to be in game it's a bit difficult to know, so you'll want to make that kind of decision for yourself.
<br /><br />Secondly, the unwrapping here is pin-free and based entirely on the cuts that I've made. The only change is that the resulting uvset has been rotated and scaled a bit. If you want to play with the seam layout, just add more and unwrap again.
<br /><br />Lastly, if I was modelling this myself I'd give some thought to other methods of getting rid of seams. There's a big nasty one down the middle of the bottom of this mesh, maybe I'd move that one to where I know there'll be shadows or model a boulder to go on top of it. You pointed out yourself that you could arrange for seams to go where you've blended in the dirt texture, that would be worth looking at. You could also add another crack on the other side of the bridge, as those are perfect spots to hide seams.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157858" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 6:06 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">thanks black dog and this is very interesting <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />firstly I didn`t know we could have seams that weren`t continuous edge loops. also great idea to hide the seams in cracks, I think I can do that quite easily from now on, and a few more beveled cracks will make the rocks look more interesting. and as you also suggested, covering them up with other models like boulders.
<br /><br />I might still use the odd pin, but I think your method will save me a lot of time in the future, as my uv maps were getting messed up a lot each time I added in more polys like the cracks, because the excessive pinning I was using was restricting the uv map from automatically shifting around while doing a lscm to compensate for the new polys uv`s.
<br /><br />so was this the first time you`ve used blender or was it just my .blend file that caused you problems? either way, I very much appreciate the time you spent on helping me with this <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />did you know we can use the file browser and deselect the "load ui" button at the bottom of the file browser?
<br /><br />this means that each blender user can retain their user prefs but load in other users project data (mesh, textures, materials etc) although some of the global prefs, like the paths blender looks for textures, are saved into the .b.blend file. although even that can be backed up or over written with global prefs for different projects we might be working on.
<br /><br />I do agree though it did seem stupid at first that blender saves some user prefs into the .blend project files, but I`ve got used to it.
<br /><br />which is the main modeling app you use?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157864" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 7:08 am "><author>Black Dog</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I use blender extensively, but rather narrowly.

<br /><br />I did know that there was an option not to load the ui, just couldn't remember where the hell it was. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I might still use the odd pin, but I think your method will save me a lot of time in the future, as my uv maps were getting messed up a lot each time I added in more polys like the cracks, because the excessive pinning I was using was restricting the uv map from automatically shifting around while doing a lscm to compensate for the new polys uv`s.</div>
<br /><br />That's the main disadvantage of pinning.

<br /><br />I`m now using blender more then any other editor, but every week I learn something new about it or realize the potential of a feature I vaguely knew about previously. if users can get past the very steep learning curve of its interface, then it`s amazing how feature packed it is, would you agree?
<br /><br />I`ll try to not use pinning for my world models, but at least it is something I can fall back on if I struggle with the seams.
<br /><br />am I right in thinking that as long as they are well placed and hidden we could have many seams on a model, especially the one ended type, and the result would still be neat looking uv map, so instead of adding in more pins as I have been doing I add in more seams, yes?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157914" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 8:22 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I haven`t done any of the new uv mapping, so this image is just of blender`s solid view mode, but it shows the rock bridge meshes spanning across the main cave.

<br /><br />Blender is certainly full of stuff to learn. The thing is, I have no need for most of it and I'm more interested in learning to make assets than learning Blender. My focus is entirely on modelling and unwrapping and as such dealing with the complexities of the rendering or materials systems just isn't appealing. Out of all the clever things that got added in 2.42, for instance, the only ones I have real use for are the uvlayout export (decent at last!) and the very useful merge to target vertex. Now they just need to make the knife tool snap to the grid.
<br /><br />While it's possible to have many seams on a model, I don't know that more is always better. The idea is simply to have the surface look as contiguous as possible without stretching, ideally using as few seams as possible. Learning how to do that effectively is really just a matter of unwrapping a few models and seeing what works.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157962" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 5:16 pm "><author>kit89</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Looking Good Ratty. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />When it comes to UV-mapping in Blender I suggest you try the "Live UnWrap Transform" feature.

<br /><br />thanks kit89, and I had already been using "lscm live transform" which is a lot better then lscm on it`s own, if we intend to then tweak the uv`s by hand, but I now think black dog`s suggestion of first making more efficient seams on these game world models, will be the most time saving method, although I`ll still be using lscm live and pinning on non world models.
<br /><br />thinking about it, I`ll probably still use just a couple of pins on the game world models but only so I don`t have to scale, rotate and align the uv maps each time I use lscm to unwrap the model, but I don`t intend to tweak their uv`s by hand.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157991" date="Posted: Sun Sep 24, 2006 7:27 am "><author>kit89</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I'd suggest looking at this tutorial.

						<div class="postbody">zombie13, sorry it took so long, but I`ve just tested inline 1 on a couple of my .ase models.
<br /><br />if there is any vertex colors like the black to white fades we use to control texture blends, then it changes the some of the white to greens or blues, which I can`t see where they are coming from since my rock texture and the d3 dirt I was using don`t appear to have either of those colors in them.
<br /><br />I also tested the "textures/common/collision" material on some of my .ase models and it doesn`t seem to clip the player or their weapon projectiles, but some of d3`s clip materials did work, also doing a window context search of the original d3 mapobjects resulted in only .lwo models to use the collision material.</div>

						<div class="postbody">OK, I had some serious trouble with that. After spending much more time wrestling with blender than pushing uvs, here we go:
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://members.westnet.com.au/GeoffGole/temp/ratty_terrain05_03_REUNWRAPPED.blend">http://members.westnet.com.au/GeoffGole ... PPED.blend</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />I suggest that you append the object from this file rather than just opening the .blend, since it's not likely you want all my wierd settings. (Putting user interface settings in the same file as mesh data is pretty stupid). Some stuff has been ripped out to make it easier for me to work with the mesh, but don't worry about that - just take a look at the seam placement and uv layout.
<br /><br />First thing to notice is that I don't just use long, continuous seams but also some short one-ended cuts. That allows lcsm to push uvs over those seams, which helps relax stretching. In a few spots that results in mapping that is not 1 to 1, but that shouldn't be a problem when you are using an existing world texture (it's a big nono if your uvs will be used for baking/lightmapping/painting though, keep that in mind). I pushed those spots to where I thought they would be difficult to see - without knowing what your lighting and mesh position is going to be in game it's a bit difficult to know, so you'll want to make that kind of decision for yourself.
<br /><br />Secondly, the unwrapping here is pin-free and based entirely on the cuts that I've made. The only change is that the resulting uvset has been rotated and scaled a bit. If you want to play with the seam layout, just add more and unwrap again.
<br /><br />Lastly, if I was modelling this myself I'd give some thought to other methods of getting rid of seams. There's a big nasty one down the middle of the bottom of this mesh, maybe I'd move that one to where I know there'll be shadows or model a boulder to go on top of it. You pointed out yourself that you could arrange for seams to go where you've blended in the dirt texture, that would be worth looking at. You could also add another crack on the other side of the bridge, as those are perfect spots to hide seams.</div>

						<div class="postbody">thanks black dog and this is very interesting <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />firstly I didn`t know we could have seams that weren`t continuous edge loops. also great idea to hide the seams in cracks, I think I can do that quite easily from now on, and a few more beveled cracks will make the rocks look more interesting. and as you also suggested, covering them up with other models like boulders.
<br /><br />I might still use the odd pin, but I think your method will save me a lot of time in the future, as my uv maps were getting messed up a lot each time I added in more polys like the cracks, because the excessive pinning I was using was restricting the uv map from automatically shifting around while doing a lscm to compensate for the new polys uv`s.
<br /><br />so was this the first time you`ve used blender or was it just my .blend file that caused you problems? either way, I very much appreciate the time you spent on helping me with this <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />did you know we can use the file browser and deselect the "load ui" button at the bottom of the file browser?
<br /><br />this means that each blender user can retain their user prefs but load in other users project data (mesh, textures, materials etc) although some of the global prefs, like the paths blender looks for textures, are saved into the .b.blend file. although even that can be backed up or over written with global prefs for different projects we might be working on.
<br /><br />I do agree though it did seem stupid at first that blender saves some user prefs into the .blend project files, but I`ve got used to it.
<br /><br />which is the main modeling app you use?</div>

						<div class="postbody">understood black dog, and I hope I didn`t sound patronizing when telling you about "load ui" button?
<br /><br />I`m now using blender more then any other editor, but every week I learn something new about it or realize the potential of a feature I vaguely knew about previously. if users can get past the very steep learning curve of its interface, then it`s amazing how feature packed it is, would you agree?
<br /><br />I`ll try to not use pinning for my world models, but at least it is something I can fall back on if I struggle with the seams.
<br /><br />am I right in thinking that as long as they are well placed and hidden we could have many seams on a model, especially the one ended type, and the result would still be neat looking uv map, so instead of adding in more pins as I have been doing I add in more seams, yes?</div>

						<div class="postbody">Patronising, no. Please never hesitate to tell me useful stuff. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /> Maybe I already know it, maybe not.
<br /><br />Blender is certainly full of stuff to learn. The thing is, I have no need for most of it and I'm more interested in learning to make assets than learning Blender. My focus is entirely on modelling and unwrapping and as such dealing with the complexities of the rendering or materials systems just isn't appealing. Out of all the clever things that got added in 2.42, for instance, the only ones I have real use for are the uvlayout export (decent at last!) and the very useful merge to target vertex. Now they just need to make the knife tool snap to the grid.
<br /><br />While it's possible to have many seams on a model, I don't know that more is always better.

<br /><br />thinking about it, I`ll probably still use just a couple of pins on the game world models but only so I don`t have to scale, rotate and align the uv maps each time I use lscm to unwrap the model, but I don`t intend to tweak their uv`s by hand.</div>

After spending much more time wrestling with blender than pushing uvs, here we go:
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://members.westnet.com.au/GeoffGole/temp/ratty_terrain05_03_REUNWRAPPED.blend">http://members.westnet.com.au/GeoffGole ... PPED.blend</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />I suggest that you append the object from this file rather than just opening the .blend, since it's not likely you want all my wierd settings. (Putting user interface settings in the same file as mesh data is pretty stupid). Some stuff has been ripped out to make it easier for me to work with the mesh, but don't worry about that - just take a look at the seam placement and uv layout.
<br /><br />First thing to notice is that I don't just use long, continuous seams but also some short one-ended cuts. That allows lcsm to push uvs over those seams, which helps relax stretching. In a few spots that results in mapping that is not 1 to 1, but that shouldn't be a problem when you are using an existing world texture (it's a big nono if your uvs will be used for baking/lightmapping/painting though, keep that in mind). I pushed those spots to where I thought they would be difficult to see - without knowing what your lighting and mesh position is going to be in game it's a bit difficult to know, so you'll want to make that kind of decision for yourself.
<br /><br />Secondly, the unwrapping here is pin-free and based entirely on the cuts that I've made. The only change is that the resulting uvset has been rotated and scaled a bit. If you want to play with the seam layout, just add more and unwrap again.
<br /><br />Lastly, if I was modelling this myself I'd give some thought to other methods of getting rid of seams. There's a big nasty one down the middle of the bottom of this mesh, maybe I'd move that one to where I know there'll be shadows or model a boulder to go on top of it. You pointed out yourself that you could arrange for seams to go where you've blended in the dirt texture, that would be worth looking at. You could also add another crack on the other side of the bridge, as those are perfect spots to hide seams.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157858" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 6:06 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">thanks black dog and this is very interesting <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />firstly I didn`t know we could have seams that weren`t continuous edge loops. also great idea to hide the seams in cracks, I think I can do that quite easily from now on, and a few more beveled cracks will make the rocks look more interesting. and as you also suggested, covering them up with other models like boulders.
<br /><br />I might still use the odd pin, but I think your method will save me a lot of time in the future, as my uv maps were getting messed up a lot each time I added in more polys like the cracks, because the excessive pinning I was using was restricting the uv map from automatically shifting around while doing a lscm to compensate for the new polys uv`s.
<br /><br />so was this the first time you`ve used blender or was it just my .blend file that caused you problems? either way, I very much appreciate the time you spent on helping me with this <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />did you know we can use the file browser and deselect the "load ui" button at the bottom of the file browser?
<br /><br />this means that each blender user can retain their user prefs but load in other users project data (mesh, textures, materials etc) although some of the global prefs, like the paths blender looks for textures, are saved into the .b.blend file. although even that can be backed up or over written with global prefs for different projects we might be working on.
<br /><br />I do agree though it did seem stupid at first that blender saves some user prefs into the .blend project files, but I`ve got used to it.

<br /><br />I`m now using blender more then any other editor, but every week I learn something new about it or realize the potential of a feature I vaguely knew about previously. if users can get past the very steep learning curve of its interface, then it`s amazing how feature packed it is, would you agree?
<br /><br />I`ll try to not use pinning for my world models, but at least it is something I can fall back on if I struggle with the seams.
<br /><br />am I right in thinking that as long as they are well placed and hidden we could have many seams on a model, especially the one ended type, and the result would still be neat looking uv map, so instead of adding in more pins as I have been doing I add in more seams, yes?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157914" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 8:22 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I haven`t done any of the new uv mapping, so this image is just of blender`s solid view mode, but it shows the rock bridge meshes spanning across the main cave.

<br /><br />Blender is certainly full of stuff to learn. The thing is, I have no need for most of it and I'm more interested in learning to make assets than learning Blender. My focus is entirely on modelling and unwrapping and as such dealing with the complexities of the rendering or materials systems just isn't appealing. Out of all the clever things that got added in 2.42, for instance, the only ones I have real use for are the uvlayout export (decent at last!) and the very useful merge to target vertex. Now they just need to make the knife tool snap to the grid.
<br /><br />While it's possible to have many seams on a model, I don't know that more is always better. The idea is simply to have the surface look as contiguous as possible without stretching, ideally using as few seams as possible. Learning how to do that effectively is really just a matter of unwrapping a few models and seeing what works.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157962" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 5:16 pm "><author>kit89</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Looking Good Ratty. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />When it comes to UV-mapping in Blender I suggest you try the "Live UnWrap Transform" feature.

<br /><br />thanks kit89, and I had already been using "lscm live transform" which is a lot better then lscm on it`s own, if we intend to then tweak the uv`s by hand, but I now think black dog`s suggestion of first making more efficient seams on these game world models, will be the most time saving method, although I`ll still be using lscm live and pinning on non world models.
<br /><br />thinking about it, I`ll probably still use just a couple of pins on the game world models but only so I don`t have to scale, rotate and align the uv maps each time I use lscm to unwrap the model, but I don`t intend to tweak their uv`s by hand.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157991" date="Posted: Sun Sep 24, 2006 7:27 am "><author>kit89</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I'd suggest looking at this tutorial.

						<div class="postbody">zombie13, sorry it took so long, but I`ve just tested inline 1 on a couple of my .ase models.
<br /><br />if there is any vertex colors like the black to white fades we use to control texture blends, then it changes the some of the white to greens or blues, which I can`t see where they are coming from since my rock texture and the d3 dirt I was using don`t appear to have either of those colors in them.
<br /><br />I also tested the "textures/common/collision" material on some of my .ase models and it doesn`t seem to clip the player or their weapon projectiles, but some of d3`s clip materials did work, also doing a window context search of the original d3 mapobjects resulted in only .lwo models to use the collision material.</div>

						<div class="postbody">OK, I had some serious trouble with that. After spending much more time wrestling with blender than pushing uvs, here we go:
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://members.westnet.com.au/GeoffGole/temp/ratty_terrain05_03_REUNWRAPPED.blend">http://members.westnet.com.au/GeoffGole ... PPED.blend</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />I suggest that you append the object from this file rather than just opening the .blend, since it's not likely you want all my wierd settings. (Putting user interface settings in the same file as mesh data is pretty stupid). Some stuff has been ripped out to make it easier for me to work with the mesh, but don't worry about that - just take a look at the seam placement and uv layout.
<br /><br />First thing to notice is that I don't just use long, continuous seams but also some short one-ended cuts. That allows lcsm to push uvs over those seams, which helps relax stretching. In a few spots that results in mapping that is not 1 to 1, but that shouldn't be a problem when you are using an existing world texture (it's a big nono if your uvs will be used for baking/lightmapping/painting though, keep that in mind). I pushed those spots to where I thought they would be difficult to see - without knowing what your lighting and mesh position is going to be in game it's a bit difficult to know, so you'll want to make that kind of decision for yourself.
<br /><br />Secondly, the unwrapping here is pin-free and based entirely on the cuts that I've made. The only change is that the resulting uvset has been rotated and scaled a bit. If you want to play with the seam layout, just add more and unwrap again.
<br /><br />Lastly, if I was modelling this myself I'd give some thought to other methods of getting rid of seams. There's a big nasty one down the middle of the bottom of this mesh, maybe I'd move that one to where I know there'll be shadows or model a boulder to go on top of it. You pointed out yourself that you could arrange for seams to go where you've blended in the dirt texture, that would be worth looking at. You could also add another crack on the other side of the bridge, as those are perfect spots to hide seams.</div>

						<div class="postbody">thanks black dog and this is very interesting <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />firstly I didn`t know we could have seams that weren`t continuous edge loops. also great idea to hide the seams in cracks, I think I can do that quite easily from now on, and a few more beveled cracks will make the rocks look more interesting. and as you also suggested, covering them up with other models like boulders.
<br /><br />I might still use the odd pin, but I think your method will save me a lot of time in the future, as my uv maps were getting messed up a lot each time I added in more polys like the cracks, because the excessive pinning I was using was restricting the uv map from automatically shifting around while doing a lscm to compensate for the new polys uv`s.
<br /><br />so was this the first time you`ve used blender or was it just my .blend file that caused you problems? either way, I very much appreciate the time you spent on helping me with this <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />did you know we can use the file browser and deselect the "load ui" button at the bottom of the file browser?
<br /><br />this means that each blender user can retain their user prefs but load in other users project data (mesh, textures, materials etc) although some of the global prefs, like the paths blender looks for textures, are saved into the .b.blend file. although even that can be backed up or over written with global prefs for different projects we might be working on.
<br /><br />I do agree though it did seem stupid at first that blender saves some user prefs into the .blend project files, but I`ve got used to it.
<br /><br />which is the main modeling app you use?</div>

						<div class="postbody">understood black dog, and I hope I didn`t sound patronizing when telling you about "load ui" button?
<br /><br />I`m now using blender more then any other editor, but every week I learn something new about it or realize the potential of a feature I vaguely knew about previously. if users can get past the very steep learning curve of its interface, then it`s amazing how feature packed it is, would you agree?
<br /><br />I`ll try to not use pinning for my world models, but at least it is something I can fall back on if I struggle with the seams.
<br /><br />am I right in thinking that as long as they are well placed and hidden we could have many seams on a model, especially the one ended type, and the result would still be neat looking uv map, so instead of adding in more pins as I have been doing I add in more seams, yes?</div>

<br /><br />Blender is certainly full of stuff to learn. The thing is, I have no need for most of it and I'm more interested in learning to make assets than learning Blender. My focus is entirely on modelling and unwrapping and as such dealing with the complexities of the rendering or materials systems just isn't appealing. Out of all the clever things that got added in 2.42, for instance, the only ones I have real use for are the uvlayout export (decent at last!) and the very useful merge to target vertex. Now they just need to make the knife tool snap to the grid.
<br /><br />While it's possible to have many seams on a model, I don't know that more is always better. The idea is simply to have the surface look as contiguous as possible without stretching, ideally using as few seams as possible. Learning how to do that effectively is really just a matter of unwrapping a few models and seeing what works.</div>

<br /><br />thanks kit89, and I had already been using "lscm live transform" which is a lot better then lscm on it`s own, if we intend to then tweak the uv`s by hand, but I now think black dog`s suggestion of first making more efficient seams on these game world models, will be the most time saving method, although I`ll still be using lscm live and pinning on non world models.
<br /><br />thinking about it, I`ll probably still use just a couple of pins on the game world models but only so I don`t have to scale, rotate and align the uv maps each time I use lscm to unwrap the model, but I don`t intend to tweak their uv`s by hand.</div>

After spending much more time wrestling with blender than pushing uvs, here we go:
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://members.westnet.com.au/GeoffGole/temp/ratty_terrain05_03_REUNWRAPPED.blend">http://members.westnet.com.au/GeoffGole ... PPED.blend</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />I suggest that you append the object from this file rather than just opening the .blend, since it's not likely you want all my wierd settings. (Putting user interface settings in the same file as mesh data is pretty stupid). Some stuff has been ripped out to make it easier for me to work with the mesh, but don't worry about that - just take a look at the seam placement and uv layout.
<br /><br />First thing to notice is that I don't just use long, continuous seams but also some short one-ended cuts. That allows lcsm to push uvs over those seams, which helps relax stretching. In a few spots that results in mapping that is not 1 to 1, but that shouldn't be a problem when you are using an existing world texture (it's a big nono if your uvs will be used for baking/lightmapping/painting though, keep that in mind). I pushed those spots to where I thought they would be difficult to see - without knowing what your lighting and mesh position is going to be in game it's a bit difficult to know, so you'll want to make that kind of decision for yourself.
<br /><br />Secondly, the unwrapping here is pin-free and based entirely on the cuts that I've made. The only change is that the resulting uvset has been rotated and scaled a bit. If you want to play with the seam layout, just add more and unwrap again.
<br /><br />Lastly, if I was modelling this myself I'd give some thought to other methods of getting rid of seams. There's a big nasty one down the middle of the bottom of this mesh, maybe I'd move that one to where I know there'll be shadows or model a boulder to go on top of it. You pointed out yourself that you could arrange for seams to go where you've blended in the dirt texture, that would be worth looking at. You could also add another crack on the other side of the bridge, as those are perfect spots to hide seams.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157858" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 6:06 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">thanks black dog and this is very interesting <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />firstly I didn`t know we could have seams that weren`t continuous edge loops. also great idea to hide the seams in cracks, I think I can do that quite easily from now on, and a few more beveled cracks will make the rocks look more interesting. and as you also suggested, covering them up with other models like boulders.
<br /><br />I might still use the odd pin, but I think your method will save me a lot of time in the future, as my uv maps were getting messed up a lot each time I added in more polys like the cracks, because the excessive pinning I was using was restricting the uv map from automatically shifting around while doing a lscm to compensate for the new polys uv`s.
<br /><br />so was this the first time you`ve used blender or was it just my .blend file that caused you problems? either way, I very much appreciate the time you spent on helping me with this <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />did you know we can use the file browser and deselect the "load ui" button at the bottom of the file browser?
<br /><br />this means that each blender user can retain their user prefs but load in other users project data (mesh, textures, materials etc) although some of the global prefs, like the paths blender looks for textures, are saved into the .b.blend file. although even that can be backed up or over written with global prefs for different projects we might be working on.
<br /><br />I do agree though it did seem stupid at first that blender saves some user prefs into the .blend project files, but I`ve got used to it.
<br /><br />which is the main modeling app you use?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157864" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 7:08 am "><author>Black Dog</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I use blender extensively, but rather narrowly.

<br /><br />I`m now using blender more then any other editor, but every week I learn something new about it or realize the potential of a feature I vaguely knew about previously. if users can get past the very steep learning curve of its interface, then it`s amazing how feature packed it is, would you agree?
<br /><br />I`ll try to not use pinning for my world models, but at least it is something I can fall back on if I struggle with the seams.

<br /><br />Blender is certainly full of stuff to learn. The thing is, I have no need for most of it and I'm more interested in learning to make assets than learning Blender. My focus is entirely on modelling and unwrapping and as such dealing with the complexities of the rendering or materials systems just isn't appealing. Out of all the clever things that got added in 2.42, for instance, the only ones I have real use for are the uvlayout export (decent at last!) and the very useful merge to target vertex. Now they just need to make the knife tool snap to the grid.
<br /><br />While it's possible to have many seams on a model, I don't know that more is always better. The idea is simply to have the surface look as contiguous as possible without stretching, ideally using as few seams as possible. Learning how to do that effectively is really just a matter of unwrapping a few models and seeing what works.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157962" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 5:16 pm "><author>kit89</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Looking Good Ratty. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />When it comes to UV-mapping in Blender I suggest you try the "Live UnWrap Transform" feature.

<br /><br />thanks kit89, and I had already been using "lscm live transform" which is a lot better then lscm on it`s own, if we intend to then tweak the uv`s by hand, but I now think black dog`s suggestion of first making more efficient seams on these game world models, will be the most time saving method, although I`ll still be using lscm live and pinning on non world models.
<br /><br />thinking about it, I`ll probably still use just a couple of pins on the game world models but only so I don`t have to scale, rotate and align the uv maps each time I use lscm to unwrap the model, but I don`t intend to tweak their uv`s by hand.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157991" date="Posted: Sun Sep 24, 2006 7:27 am "><author>kit89</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I'd suggest looking at this tutorial.

						<div class="postbody">zombie13, sorry it took so long, but I`ve just tested inline 1 on a couple of my .ase models.
<br /><br />if there is any vertex colors like the black to white fades we use to control texture blends, then it changes the some of the white to greens or blues, which I can`t see where they are coming from since my rock texture and the d3 dirt I was using don`t appear to have either of those colors in them.
<br /><br />I also tested the "textures/common/collision" material on some of my .ase models and it doesn`t seem to clip the player or their weapon projectiles, but some of d3`s clip materials did work, also doing a window context search of the original d3 mapobjects resulted in only .lwo models to use the collision material.</div>

						<div class="postbody">OK, I had some serious trouble with that. After spending much more time wrestling with blender than pushing uvs, here we go:
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://members.westnet.com.au/GeoffGole/temp/ratty_terrain05_03_REUNWRAPPED.blend">http://members.westnet.com.au/GeoffGole ... PPED.blend</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />I suggest that you append the object from this file rather than just opening the .blend, since it's not likely you want all my wierd settings. (Putting user interface settings in the same file as mesh data is pretty stupid). Some stuff has been ripped out to make it easier for me to work with the mesh, but don't worry about that - just take a look at the seam placement and uv layout.
<br /><br />First thing to notice is that I don't just use long, continuous seams but also some short one-ended cuts. That allows lcsm to push uvs over those seams, which helps relax stretching. In a few spots that results in mapping that is not 1 to 1, but that shouldn't be a problem when you are using an existing world texture (it's a big nono if your uvs will be used for baking/lightmapping/painting though, keep that in mind). I pushed those spots to where I thought they would be difficult to see - without knowing what your lighting and mesh position is going to be in game it's a bit difficult to know, so you'll want to make that kind of decision for yourself.
<br /><br />Secondly, the unwrapping here is pin-free and based entirely on the cuts that I've made. The only change is that the resulting uvset has been rotated and scaled a bit. If you want to play with the seam layout, just add more and unwrap again.
<br /><br />Lastly, if I was modelling this myself I'd give some thought to other methods of getting rid of seams. There's a big nasty one down the middle of the bottom of this mesh, maybe I'd move that one to where I know there'll be shadows or model a boulder to go on top of it. You pointed out yourself that you could arrange for seams to go where you've blended in the dirt texture, that would be worth looking at. You could also add another crack on the other side of the bridge, as those are perfect spots to hide seams.</div>

<br /><br />I might still use the odd pin, but I think your method will save me a lot of time in the future, as my uv maps were getting messed up a lot each time I added in more polys like the cracks, because the excessive pinning I was using was restricting the uv map from automatically shifting around while doing a lscm to compensate for the new polys uv`s.
<br /><br />so was this the first time you`ve used blender or was it just my .blend file that caused you problems? either way, I very much appreciate the time you spent on helping me with this <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />did you know we can use the file browser and deselect the "load ui" button at the bottom of the file browser?
<br /><br />this means that each blender user can retain their user prefs but load in other users project data (mesh, textures, materials etc) although some of the global prefs, like the paths blender looks for textures, are saved into the .b.blend file. although even that can be backed up or over written with global prefs for different projects we might be working on.
<br /><br />I do agree though it did seem stupid at first that blender saves some user prefs into the .blend project files, but I`ve got used to it.
<br /><br />which is the main modeling app you use?</div>

						<div class="postbody">understood black dog, and I hope I didn`t sound patronizing when telling you about "load ui" button?
<br /><br />I`m now using blender more then any other editor, but every week I learn something new about it or realize the potential of a feature I vaguely knew about previously. if users can get past the very steep learning curve of its interface, then it`s amazing how feature packed it is, would you agree?
<br /><br />I`ll try to not use pinning for my world models, but at least it is something I can fall back on if I struggle with the seams.
<br /><br />am I right in thinking that as long as they are well placed and hidden we could have many seams on a model, especially the one ended type, and the result would still be neat looking uv map, so instead of adding in more pins as I have been doing I add in more seams, yes?</div>

<br /><br />Blender is certainly full of stuff to learn. The thing is, I have no need for most of it and I'm more interested in learning to make assets than learning Blender. My focus is entirely on modelling and unwrapping and as such dealing with the complexities of the rendering or materials systems just isn't appealing. Out of all the clever things that got added in 2.42, for instance, the only ones I have real use for are the uvlayout export (decent at last!) and the very useful merge to target vertex. Now they just need to make the knife tool snap to the grid.
<br /><br />While it's possible to have many seams on a model, I don't know that more is always better. The idea is simply to have the surface look as contiguous as possible without stretching, ideally using as few seams as possible. Learning how to do that effectively is really just a matter of unwrapping a few models and seeing what works.</div>

This allows the skin to change as you move pinned faces making it very flexible to modify skins effectively. Although it wont move pinned faces so its best to have maybe 4 or 5 pins.
<br /><br />Depending on the size you could just leave the standard uv-map (Each quad/tris uses the entire texture) although if its not a repeating texture it will look silly..

<br /><br />thinking about it, I`ll probably still use just a couple of pins on the game world models but only so I don`t have to scale, rotate and align the uv maps each time I use lscm to unwrap the model, but I don`t intend to tweak their uv`s by hand.</div>

<br /><br />I suggest that you append the object from this file rather than just opening the .blend, since it's not likely you want all my wierd settings. (Putting user interface settings in the same file as mesh data is pretty stupid). Some stuff has been ripped out to make it easier for me to work with the mesh, but don't worry about that - just take a look at the seam placement and uv layout.
<br /><br />First thing to notice is that I don't just use long, continuous seams but also some short one-ended cuts. That allows lcsm to push uvs over those seams, which helps relax stretching. In a few spots that results in mapping that is not 1 to 1, but that shouldn't be a problem when you are using an existing world texture (it's a big nono if your uvs will be used for baking/lightmapping/painting though, keep that in mind). I pushed those spots to where I thought they would be difficult to see - without knowing what your lighting and mesh position is going to be in game it's a bit difficult to know, so you'll want to make that kind of decision for yourself.
<br /><br />Secondly, the unwrapping here is pin-free and based entirely on the cuts that I've made. The only change is that the resulting uvset has been rotated and scaled a bit. If you want to play with the seam layout, just add more and unwrap again.
<br /><br />Lastly, if I was modelling this myself I'd give some thought to other methods of getting rid of seams. There's a big nasty one down the middle of the bottom of this mesh, maybe I'd move that one to where I know there'll be shadows or model a boulder to go on top of it. You pointed out yourself that you could arrange for seams to go where you've blended in the dirt texture, that would be worth looking at. You could also add another crack on the other side of the bridge, as those are perfect spots to hide seams.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157858" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 6:06 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">thanks black dog and this is very interesting <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />firstly I didn`t know we could have seams that weren`t continuous edge loops. also great idea to hide the seams in cracks, I think I can do that quite easily from now on, and a few more beveled cracks will make the rocks look more interesting. and as you also suggested, covering them up with other models like boulders.
<br /><br />I might still use the odd pin, but I think your method will save me a lot of time in the future, as my uv maps were getting messed up a lot each time I added in more polys like the cracks, because the excessive pinning I was using was restricting the uv map from automatically shifting around while doing a lscm to compensate for the new polys uv`s.
<br /><br />so was this the first time you`ve used blender or was it just my .blend file that caused you problems? either way, I very much appreciate the time you spent on helping me with this <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />did you know we can use the file browser and deselect the "load ui" button at the bottom of the file browser?
<br /><br />this means that each blender user can retain their user prefs but load in other users project data (mesh, textures, materials etc) although some of the global prefs, like the paths blender looks for textures, are saved into the .b.blend file. although even that can be backed up or over written with global prefs for different projects we might be working on.
<br /><br />I do agree though it did seem stupid at first that blender saves some user prefs into the .blend project files, but I`ve got used to it.
<br /><br />which is the main modeling app you use?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157864" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 7:08 am "><author>Black Dog</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I use blender extensively, but rather narrowly.

<br /><br />I`m now using blender more then any other editor, but every week I learn something new about it or realize the potential of a feature I vaguely knew about previously. if users can get past the very steep learning curve of its interface, then it`s amazing how feature packed it is, would you agree?
<br /><br />I`ll try to not use pinning for my world models, but at least it is something I can fall back on if I struggle with the seams.
<br /><br />am I right in thinking that as long as they are well placed and hidden we could have many seams on a model, especially the one ended type, and the result would still be neat looking uv map, so instead of adding in more pins as I have been doing I add in more seams, yes?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157914" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 8:22 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I haven`t done any of the new uv mapping, so this image is just of blender`s solid view mode, but it shows the rock bridge meshes spanning across the main cave.

<br /><br />Blender is certainly full of stuff to learn. The thing is, I have no need for most of it and I'm more interested in learning to make assets than learning Blender. My focus is entirely on modelling and unwrapping and as such dealing with the complexities of the rendering or materials systems just isn't appealing. Out of all the clever things that got added in 2.42, for instance, the only ones I have real use for are the uvlayout export (decent at last!) and the very useful merge to target vertex. Now they just need to make the knife tool snap to the grid.
<br /><br />While it's possible to have many seams on a model, I don't know that more is always better. The idea is simply to have the surface look as contiguous as possible without stretching, ideally using as few seams as possible. Learning how to do that effectively is really just a matter of unwrapping a few models and seeing what works.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157962" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 5:16 pm "><author>kit89</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Looking Good Ratty. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />When it comes to UV-mapping in Blender I suggest you try the "Live UnWrap Transform" feature.

The idea is simply to have the surface look as contiguous as possible without stretching, ideally using as few seams as possible. Learning how to do that effectively is really just a matter of unwrapping a few models and seeing what works. </div><br /><br />understood and thanks <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">kit89 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"> Looking Good Ratty.  <br /><br />When it comes to UV-mapping in Blender I suggest you try the "Live UnWrap Transform" feature. This allows the skin to change as you move pinned faces making it very flexible to modify skins effectively. Although it wont move pinned faces so its best to have maybe 4 or 5 pins. <br /><br />Depending on the size you could just leave the standard uv-map (Each quad/tris uses the entire texture) although if its not a repeating texture it will look silly.. <br /><br />Cant wait to see more. </div>
<br /><br />thanks kit89, and I had already been using "lscm live transform" which is a lot better then lscm on it`s own, if we intend to then tweak the uv`s by hand, but I now think black dog`s suggestion of first making more efficient seams on these game world models, will be the most time saving method, although I`ll still be using lscm live and pinning on non world models.
<br /><br />thinking about it, I`ll probably still use just a couple of pins on the game world models but only so I don`t have to scale, rotate and align the uv maps each time I use lscm to unwrap the model, but I don`t intend to tweak their uv`s by hand.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157991" date="Posted: Sun Sep 24, 2006 7:27 am "><author>kit89</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I'd suggest looking at this tutorial.

						<div class="postbody">zombie13, sorry it took so long, but I`ve just tested inline 1 on a couple of my .ase models.
<br /><br />if there is any vertex colors like the black to white fades we use to control texture blends, then it changes the some of the white to greens or blues, which I can`t see where they are coming from since my rock texture and the d3 dirt I was using don`t appear to have either of those colors in them.
<br /><br />I also tested the "textures/common/collision" material on some of my .ase models and it doesn`t seem to clip the player or their weapon projectiles, but some of d3`s clip materials did work, also doing a window context search of the original d3 mapobjects resulted in only .lwo models to use the collision material.</div>

						<div class="postbody">OK, I had some serious trouble with that. After spending much more time wrestling with blender than pushing uvs, here we go:
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://members.westnet.com.au/GeoffGole/temp/ratty_terrain05_03_REUNWRAPPED.blend">http://members.westnet.com.au/GeoffGole ... PPED.blend</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />I suggest that you append the object from this file rather than just opening the .blend, since it's not likely you want all my wierd settings. (Putting user interface settings in the same file as mesh data is pretty stupid). Some stuff has been ripped out to make it easier for me to work with the mesh, but don't worry about that - just take a look at the seam placement and uv layout.
<br /><br />First thing to notice is that I don't just use long, continuous seams but also some short one-ended cuts. That allows lcsm to push uvs over those seams, which helps relax stretching. In a few spots that results in mapping that is not 1 to 1, but that shouldn't be a problem when you are using an existing world texture (it's a big nono if your uvs will be used for baking/lightmapping/painting though, keep that in mind). I pushed those spots to where I thought they would be difficult to see - without knowing what your lighting and mesh position is going to be in game it's a bit difficult to know, so you'll want to make that kind of decision for yourself.
<br /><br />Secondly, the unwrapping here is pin-free and based entirely on the cuts that I've made. The only change is that the resulting uvset has been rotated and scaled a bit. If you want to play with the seam layout, just add more and unwrap again.
<br /><br />Lastly, if I was modelling this myself I'd give some thought to other methods of getting rid of seams. There's a big nasty one down the middle of the bottom of this mesh, maybe I'd move that one to where I know there'll be shadows or model a boulder to go on top of it. You pointed out yourself that you could arrange for seams to go where you've blended in the dirt texture, that would be worth looking at. You could also add another crack on the other side of the bridge, as those are perfect spots to hide seams.</div>

						<div class="postbody">thanks black dog and this is very interesting <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />firstly I didn`t know we could have seams that weren`t continuous edge loops. also great idea to hide the seams in cracks, I think I can do that quite easily from now on, and a few more beveled cracks will make the rocks look more interesting. and as you also suggested, covering them up with other models like boulders.
<br /><br />I might still use the odd pin, but I think your method will save me a lot of time in the future, as my uv maps were getting messed up a lot each time I added in more polys like the cracks, because the excessive pinning I was using was restricting the uv map from automatically shifting around while doing a lscm to compensate for the new polys uv`s.
<br /><br />so was this the first time you`ve used blender or was it just my .blend file that caused you problems? either way, I very much appreciate the time you spent on helping me with this <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />did you know we can use the file browser and deselect the "load ui" button at the bottom of the file browser?
<br /><br />this means that each blender user can retain their user prefs but load in other users project data (mesh, textures, materials etc) although some of the global prefs, like the paths blender looks for textures, are saved into the .b.blend file. although even that can be backed up or over written with global prefs for different projects we might be working on.
<br /><br />I do agree though it did seem stupid at first that blender saves some user prefs into the .blend project files, but I`ve got used to it.
<br /><br />which is the main modeling app you use?</div>

						<div class="postbody">understood black dog, and I hope I didn`t sound patronizing when telling you about "load ui" button?
<br /><br />I`m now using blender more then any other editor, but every week I learn something new about it or realize the potential of a feature I vaguely knew about previously. if users can get past the very steep learning curve of its interface, then it`s amazing how feature packed it is, would you agree?
<br /><br />I`ll try to not use pinning for my world models, but at least it is something I can fall back on if I struggle with the seams.
<br /><br />am I right in thinking that as long as they are well placed and hidden we could have many seams on a model, especially the one ended type, and the result would still be neat looking uv map, so instead of adding in more pins as I have been doing I add in more seams, yes?</div>

						<div class="postbody">Patronising, no. Please never hesitate to tell me useful stuff. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /> Maybe I already know it, maybe not.
<br /><br />Blender is certainly full of stuff to learn. The thing is, I have no need for most of it and I'm more interested in learning to make assets than learning Blender. My focus is entirely on modelling and unwrapping and as such dealing with the complexities of the rendering or materials systems just isn't appealing. Out of all the clever things that got added in 2.42, for instance, the only ones I have real use for are the uvlayout export (decent at last!) and the very useful merge to target vertex. Now they just need to make the knife tool snap to the grid.
<br /><br />While it's possible to have many seams on a model, I don't know that more is always better. The idea is simply to have the surface look as contiguous as possible without stretching, ideally using as few seams as possible. Learning how to do that effectively is really just a matter of unwrapping a few models and seeing what works.</div>

<br /><br />thanks kit89, and I had already been using "lscm live transform" which is a lot better then lscm on it`s own, if we intend to then tweak the uv`s by hand, but I now think black dog`s suggestion of first making more efficient seams on these game world models, will be the most time saving method, although I`ll still be using lscm live and pinning on non world models.
<br /><br />thinking about it, I`ll probably still use just a couple of pins on the game world models but only so I don`t have to scale, rotate and align the uv maps each time I use lscm to unwrap the model, but I don`t intend to tweak their uv`s by hand.</div>

<br /><br />I suggest that you append the object from this file rather than just opening the .blend, since it's not likely you want all my wierd settings. (Putting user interface settings in the same file as mesh data is pretty stupid). Some stuff has been ripped out to make it easier for me to work with the mesh, but don't worry about that - just take a look at the seam placement and uv layout.
<br /><br />First thing to notice is that I don't just use long, continuous seams but also some short one-ended cuts. That allows lcsm to push uvs over those seams, which helps relax stretching. In a few spots that results in mapping that is not 1 to 1, but that shouldn't be a problem when you are using an existing world texture (it's a big nono if your uvs will be used for baking/lightmapping/painting though, keep that in mind). I pushed those spots to where I thought they would be difficult to see - without knowing what your lighting and mesh position is going to be in game it's a bit difficult to know, so you'll want to make that kind of decision for yourself.
<br /><br />Secondly, the unwrapping here is pin-free and based entirely on the cuts that I've made. The only change is that the resulting uvset has been rotated and scaled a bit. If you want to play with the seam layout, just add more and unwrap again.
<br /><br />Lastly, if I was modelling this myself I'd give some thought to other methods of getting rid of seams. There's a big nasty one down the middle of the bottom of this mesh, maybe I'd move that one to where I know there'll be shadows or model a boulder to go on top of it. You pointed out yourself that you could arrange for seams to go where you've blended in the dirt texture, that would be worth looking at. You could also add another crack on the other side of the bridge, as those are perfect spots to hide seams.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157858" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 6:06 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">thanks black dog and this is very interesting <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />firstly I didn`t know we could have seams that weren`t continuous edge loops. also great idea to hide the seams in cracks, I think I can do that quite easily from now on, and a few more beveled cracks will make the rocks look more interesting. and as you also suggested, covering them up with other models like boulders.
<br /><br />I might still use the odd pin, but I think your method will save me a lot of time in the future, as my uv maps were getting messed up a lot each time I added in more polys like the cracks, because the excessive pinning I was using was restricting the uv map from automatically shifting around while doing a lscm to compensate for the new polys uv`s.
<br /><br />so was this the first time you`ve used blender or was it just my .blend file that caused you problems? either way, I very much appreciate the time you spent on helping me with this <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />did you know we can use the file browser and deselect the "load ui" button at the bottom of the file browser?
<br /><br />this means that each blender user can retain their user prefs but load in other users project data (mesh, textures, materials etc) although some of the global prefs, like the paths blender looks for textures, are saved into the .b.blend file. although even that can be backed up or over written with global prefs for different projects we might be working on.
<br /><br />I do agree though it did seem stupid at first that blender saves some user prefs into the .blend project files, but I`ve got used to it.
<br /><br />which is the main modeling app you use?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157864" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 7:08 am "><author>Black Dog</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I use blender extensively, but rather narrowly.

<br /><br />I`m now using blender more then any other editor, but every week I learn something new about it or realize the potential of a feature I vaguely knew about previously. if users can get past the very steep learning curve of its interface, then it`s amazing how feature packed it is, would you agree?
<br /><br />I`ll try to not use pinning for my world models, but at least it is something I can fall back on if I struggle with the seams.
<br /><br />am I right in thinking that as long as they are well placed and hidden we could have many seams on a model, especially the one ended type, and the result would still be neat looking uv map, so instead of adding in more pins as I have been doing I add in more seams, yes?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157914" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 8:22 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I haven`t done any of the new uv mapping, so this image is just of blender`s solid view mode, but it shows the rock bridge meshes spanning across the main cave.

<br /><br />Blender is certainly full of stuff to learn. The thing is, I have no need for most of it and I'm more interested in learning to make assets than learning Blender. My focus is entirely on modelling and unwrapping and as such dealing with the complexities of the rendering or materials systems just isn't appealing. Out of all the clever things that got added in 2.42, for instance, the only ones I have real use for are the uvlayout export (decent at last!) and the very useful merge to target vertex. Now they just need to make the knife tool snap to the grid.
<br /><br />While it's possible to have many seams on a model, I don't know that more is always better. The idea is simply to have the surface look as contiguous as possible without stretching, ideally using as few seams as possible. Learning how to do that effectively is really just a matter of unwrapping a few models and seeing what works.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157962" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 5:16 pm "><author>kit89</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Looking Good Ratty. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />When it comes to UV-mapping in Blender I suggest you try the "Live UnWrap Transform" feature.

<br /><br />if there is any vertex colors like the black to white fades we use to control texture blends, then it changes the some of the white to greens or blues, which I can`t see where they are coming from since my rock texture and the d3 dirt I was using don`t appear to have either of those colors in them.
<br /><br />I also tested the "textures/common/collision" material on some of my .ase models and it doesn`t seem to clip the player or their weapon projectiles, but some of d3`s clip materials did work, also doing a window context search of the original d3 mapobjects resulted in only .lwo models to use the collision material.</div>

						<div class="postbody">OK, I had some serious trouble with that. After spending much more time wrestling with blender than pushing uvs, here we go:
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://members.westnet.com.au/GeoffGole/temp/ratty_terrain05_03_REUNWRAPPED.blend">http://members.westnet.com.au/GeoffGole ... PPED.blend</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />I suggest that you append the object from this file rather than just opening the .blend, since it's not likely you want all my wierd settings. (Putting user interface settings in the same file as mesh data is pretty stupid). Some stuff has been ripped out to make it easier for me to work with the mesh, but don't worry about that - just take a look at the seam placement and uv layout.
<br /><br />First thing to notice is that I don't just use long, continuous seams but also some short one-ended cuts. That allows lcsm to push uvs over those seams, which helps relax stretching. In a few spots that results in mapping that is not 1 to 1, but that shouldn't be a problem when you are using an existing world texture (it's a big nono if your uvs will be used for baking/lightmapping/painting though, keep that in mind). I pushed those spots to where I thought they would be difficult to see - without knowing what your lighting and mesh position is going to be in game it's a bit difficult to know, so you'll want to make that kind of decision for yourself.
<br /><br />Secondly, the unwrapping here is pin-free and based entirely on the cuts that I've made. The only change is that the resulting uvset has been rotated and scaled a bit. If you want to play with the seam layout, just add more and unwrap again.
<br /><br />Lastly, if I was modelling this myself I'd give some thought to other methods of getting rid of seams. There's a big nasty one down the middle of the bottom of this mesh, maybe I'd move that one to where I know there'll be shadows or model a boulder to go on top of it. You pointed out yourself that you could arrange for seams to go where you've blended in the dirt texture, that would be worth looking at. You could also add another crack on the other side of the bridge, as those are perfect spots to hide seams.</div>

						<div class="postbody">thanks black dog and this is very interesting <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />firstly I didn`t know we could have seams that weren`t continuous edge loops. also great idea to hide the seams in cracks, I think I can do that quite easily from now on, and a few more beveled cracks will make the rocks look more interesting. and as you also suggested, covering them up with other models like boulders.
<br /><br />I might still use the odd pin, but I think your method will save me a lot of time in the future, as my uv maps were getting messed up a lot each time I added in more polys like the cracks, because the excessive pinning I was using was restricting the uv map from automatically shifting around while doing a lscm to compensate for the new polys uv`s.
<br /><br />so was this the first time you`ve used blender or was it just my .blend file that caused you problems? either way, I very much appreciate the time you spent on helping me with this <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />did you know we can use the file browser and deselect the "load ui" button at the bottom of the file browser?
<br /><br />this means that each blender user can retain their user prefs but load in other users project data (mesh, textures, materials etc) although some of the global prefs, like the paths blender looks for textures, are saved into the .b.blend file. although even that can be backed up or over written with global prefs for different projects we might be working on.
<br /><br />I do agree though it did seem stupid at first that blender saves some user prefs into the .blend project files, but I`ve got used to it.
<br /><br />which is the main modeling app you use?</div>

						<div class="postbody">understood black dog, and I hope I didn`t sound patronizing when telling you about "load ui" button?
<br /><br />I`m now using blender more then any other editor, but every week I learn something new about it or realize the potential of a feature I vaguely knew about previously. if users can get past the very steep learning curve of its interface, then it`s amazing how feature packed it is, would you agree?
<br /><br />I`ll try to not use pinning for my world models, but at least it is something I can fall back on if I struggle with the seams.
<br /><br />am I right in thinking that as long as they are well placed and hidden we could have many seams on a model, especially the one ended type, and the result would still be neat looking uv map, so instead of adding in more pins as I have been doing I add in more seams, yes?</div>

						<div class="postbody">Patronising, no. Please never hesitate to tell me useful stuff. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /> Maybe I already know it, maybe not.
<br /><br />Blender is certainly full of stuff to learn. The thing is, I have no need for most of it and I'm more interested in learning to make assets than learning Blender. My focus is entirely on modelling and unwrapping and as such dealing with the complexities of the rendering or materials systems just isn't appealing. Out of all the clever things that got added in 2.42, for instance, the only ones I have real use for are the uvlayout export (decent at last!) and the very useful merge to target vertex. Now they just need to make the knife tool snap to the grid.
<br /><br />While it's possible to have many seams on a model, I don't know that more is always better. The idea is simply to have the surface look as contiguous as possible without stretching, ideally using as few seams as possible. Learning how to do that effectively is really just a matter of unwrapping a few models and seeing what works.</div>

<br /><br />thanks kit89, and I had already been using "lscm live transform" which is a lot better then lscm on it`s own, if we intend to then tweak the uv`s by hand, but I now think black dog`s suggestion of first making more efficient seams on these game world models, will be the most time saving method, although I`ll still be using lscm live and pinning on non world models.
<br /><br />thinking about it, I`ll probably still use just a couple of pins on the game world models but only so I don`t have to scale, rotate and align the uv maps each time I use lscm to unwrap the model, but I don`t intend to tweak their uv`s by hand.</div>

After spending much more time wrestling with blender than pushing uvs, here we go:
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://members.westnet.com.au/GeoffGole/temp/ratty_terrain05_03_REUNWRAPPED.blend">http://members.westnet.com.au/GeoffGole ... PPED.blend</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />I suggest that you append the object from this file rather than just opening the .blend, since it's not likely you want all my wierd settings. (Putting user interface settings in the same file as mesh data is pretty stupid). Some stuff has been ripped out to make it easier for me to work with the mesh, but don't worry about that - just take a look at the seam placement and uv layout.
<br /><br />First thing to notice is that I don't just use long, continuous seams but also some short one-ended cuts. That allows lcsm to push uvs over those seams, which helps relax stretching. In a few spots that results in mapping that is not 1 to 1, but that shouldn't be a problem when you are using an existing world texture (it's a big nono if your uvs will be used for baking/lightmapping/painting though, keep that in mind). I pushed those spots to where I thought they would be difficult to see - without knowing what your lighting and mesh position is going to be in game it's a bit difficult to know, so you'll want to make that kind of decision for yourself.
<br /><br />Secondly, the unwrapping here is pin-free and based entirely on the cuts that I've made. The only change is that the resulting uvset has been rotated and scaled a bit. If you want to play with the seam layout, just add more and unwrap again.
<br /><br />Lastly, if I was modelling this myself I'd give some thought to other methods of getting rid of seams. There's a big nasty one down the middle of the bottom of this mesh, maybe I'd move that one to where I know there'll be shadows or model a boulder to go on top of it. You pointed out yourself that you could arrange for seams to go where you've blended in the dirt texture, that would be worth looking at. You could also add another crack on the other side of the bridge, as those are perfect spots to hide seams.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157858" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 6:06 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">thanks black dog and this is very interesting <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />firstly I didn`t know we could have seams that weren`t continuous edge loops. also great idea to hide the seams in cracks, I think I can do that quite easily from now on, and a few more beveled cracks will make the rocks look more interesting. and as you also suggested, covering them up with other models like boulders.
<br /><br />I might still use the odd pin, but I think your method will save me a lot of time in the future, as my uv maps were getting messed up a lot each time I added in more polys like the cracks, because the excessive pinning I was using was restricting the uv map from automatically shifting around while doing a lscm to compensate for the new polys uv`s.
<br /><br />so was this the first time you`ve used blender or was it just my .blend file that caused you problems? either way, I very much appreciate the time you spent on helping me with this <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />did you know we can use the file browser and deselect the "load ui" button at the bottom of the file browser?
<br /><br />this means that each blender user can retain their user prefs but load in other users project data (mesh, textures, materials etc) although some of the global prefs, like the paths blender looks for textures, are saved into the .b.blend file. although even that can be backed up or over written with global prefs for different projects we might be working on.
<br /><br />I do agree though it did seem stupid at first that blender saves some user prefs into the .blend project files, but I`ve got used to it.
<br /><br />which is the main modeling app you use?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157864" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 7:08 am "><author>Black Dog</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I use blender extensively, but rather narrowly.

<br /><br />I`m now using blender more then any other editor, but every week I learn something new about it or realize the potential of a feature I vaguely knew about previously. if users can get past the very steep learning curve of its interface, then it`s amazing how feature packed it is, would you agree?
<br /><br />I`ll try to not use pinning for my world models, but at least it is something I can fall back on if I struggle with the seams.
<br /><br />am I right in thinking that as long as they are well placed and hidden we could have many seams on a model, especially the one ended type, and the result would still be neat looking uv map, so instead of adding in more pins as I have been doing I add in more seams, yes?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157914" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 8:22 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I haven`t done any of the new uv mapping, so this image is just of blender`s solid view mode, but it shows the rock bridge meshes spanning across the main cave.

<br /><br />Blender is certainly full of stuff to learn. The thing is, I have no need for most of it and I'm more interested in learning to make assets than learning Blender. My focus is entirely on modelling and unwrapping and as such dealing with the complexities of the rendering or materials systems just isn't appealing. Out of all the clever things that got added in 2.42, for instance, the only ones I have real use for are the uvlayout export (decent at last!) and the very useful merge to target vertex. Now they just need to make the knife tool snap to the grid.
<br /><br />While it's possible to have many seams on a model, I don't know that more is always better. The idea is simply to have the surface look as contiguous as possible without stretching, ideally using as few seams as possible. Learning how to do that effectively is really just a matter of unwrapping a few models and seeing what works.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157962" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 5:16 pm "><author>kit89</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Looking Good Ratty. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />When it comes to UV-mapping in Blender I suggest you try the "Live UnWrap Transform" feature.

<br /><br />thanks kit89, and I had already been using "lscm live transform" which is a lot better then lscm on it`s own, if we intend to then tweak the uv`s by hand, but I now think black dog`s suggestion of first making more efficient seams on these game world models, will be the most time saving method, although I`ll still be using lscm live and pinning on non world models.
<br /><br />thinking about it, I`ll probably still use just a couple of pins on the game world models but only so I don`t have to scale, rotate and align the uv maps each time I use lscm to unwrap the model, but I don`t intend to tweak their uv`s by hand.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157991" date="Posted: Sun Sep 24, 2006 7:27 am "><author>kit89</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I'd suggest looking at this tutorial.

						<div class="postbody">zombie13, sorry it took so long, but I`ve just tested inline 1 on a couple of my .ase models.
<br /><br />if there is any vertex colors like the black to white fades we use to control texture blends, then it changes the some of the white to greens or blues, which I can`t see where they are coming from since my rock texture and the d3 dirt I was using don`t appear to have either of those colors in them.
<br /><br />I also tested the "textures/common/collision" material on some of my .ase models and it doesn`t seem to clip the player or their weapon projectiles, but some of d3`s clip materials did work, also doing a window context search of the original d3 mapobjects resulted in only .lwo models to use the collision material.</div>

						<div class="postbody">OK, I had some serious trouble with that. After spending much more time wrestling with blender than pushing uvs, here we go:
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://members.westnet.com.au/GeoffGole/temp/ratty_terrain05_03_REUNWRAPPED.blend">http://members.westnet.com.au/GeoffGole ... PPED.blend</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />I suggest that you append the object from this file rather than just opening the .blend, since it's not likely you want all my wierd settings. (Putting user interface settings in the same file as mesh data is pretty stupid). Some stuff has been ripped out to make it easier for me to work with the mesh, but don't worry about that - just take a look at the seam placement and uv layout.
<br /><br />First thing to notice is that I don't just use long, continuous seams but also some short one-ended cuts. That allows lcsm to push uvs over those seams, which helps relax stretching. In a few spots that results in mapping that is not 1 to 1, but that shouldn't be a problem when you are using an existing world texture (it's a big nono if your uvs will be used for baking/lightmapping/painting though, keep that in mind). I pushed those spots to where I thought they would be difficult to see - without knowing what your lighting and mesh position is going to be in game it's a bit difficult to know, so you'll want to make that kind of decision for yourself.
<br /><br />Secondly, the unwrapping here is pin-free and based entirely on the cuts that I've made. The only change is that the resulting uvset has been rotated and scaled a bit. If you want to play with the seam layout, just add more and unwrap again.
<br /><br />Lastly, if I was modelling this myself I'd give some thought to other methods of getting rid of seams. There's a big nasty one down the middle of the bottom of this mesh, maybe I'd move that one to where I know there'll be shadows or model a boulder to go on top of it. You pointed out yourself that you could arrange for seams to go where you've blended in the dirt texture, that would be worth looking at. You could also add another crack on the other side of the bridge, as those are perfect spots to hide seams.</div>

						<div class="postbody">thanks black dog and this is very interesting <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />firstly I didn`t know we could have seams that weren`t continuous edge loops. also great idea to hide the seams in cracks, I think I can do that quite easily from now on, and a few more beveled cracks will make the rocks look more interesting. and as you also suggested, covering them up with other models like boulders.
<br /><br />I might still use the odd pin, but I think your method will save me a lot of time in the future, as my uv maps were getting messed up a lot each time I added in more polys like the cracks, because the excessive pinning I was using was restricting the uv map from automatically shifting around while doing a lscm to compensate for the new polys uv`s.
<br /><br />so was this the first time you`ve used blender or was it just my .blend file that caused you problems? either way, I very much appreciate the time you spent on helping me with this <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />did you know we can use the file browser and deselect the "load ui" button at the bottom of the file browser?
<br /><br />this means that each blender user can retain their user prefs but load in other users project data (mesh, textures, materials etc) although some of the global prefs, like the paths blender looks for textures, are saved into the .b.blend file. although even that can be backed up or over written with global prefs for different projects we might be working on.
<br /><br />I do agree though it did seem stupid at first that blender saves some user prefs into the .blend project files, but I`ve got used to it.
<br /><br />which is the main modeling app you use?</div>

						<div class="postbody">understood black dog, and I hope I didn`t sound patronizing when telling you about "load ui" button?
<br /><br />I`m now using blender more then any other editor, but every week I learn something new about it or realize the potential of a feature I vaguely knew about previously. if users can get past the very steep learning curve of its interface, then it`s amazing how feature packed it is, would you agree?
<br /><br />I`ll try to not use pinning for my world models, but at least it is something I can fall back on if I struggle with the seams.
<br /><br />am I right in thinking that as long as they are well placed and hidden we could have many seams on a model, especially the one ended type, and the result would still be neat looking uv map, so instead of adding in more pins as I have been doing I add in more seams, yes?</div>

						<div class="postbody">Patronising, no. Please never hesitate to tell me useful stuff. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /> Maybe I already know it, maybe not.
<br /><br />Blender is certainly full of stuff to learn. The thing is, I have no need for most of it and I'm more interested in learning to make assets than learning Blender. My focus is entirely on modelling and unwrapping and as such dealing with the complexities of the rendering or materials systems just isn't appealing. Out of all the clever things that got added in 2.42, for instance, the only ones I have real use for are the uvlayout export (decent at last!) and the very useful merge to target vertex. Now they just need to make the knife tool snap to the grid.
<br /><br />While it's possible to have many seams on a model, I don't know that more is always better. The idea is simply to have the surface look as contiguous as possible without stretching, ideally using as few seams as possible. Learning how to do that effectively is really just a matter of unwrapping a few models and seeing what works.</div>

<br /><br />thanks kit89, and I had already been using "lscm live transform" which is a lot better then lscm on it`s own, if we intend to then tweak the uv`s by hand, but I now think black dog`s suggestion of first making more efficient seams on these game world models, will be the most time saving method, although I`ll still be using lscm live and pinning on non world models.
<br /><br />thinking about it, I`ll probably still use just a couple of pins on the game world models but only so I don`t have to scale, rotate and align the uv maps each time I use lscm to unwrap the model, but I don`t intend to tweak their uv`s by hand.</div>

<br /><br />thanks blackdog, and I could ul the model`s .blend file if you have blender or perhaps export it to a format your modeling app can use?
<br /><br />either way I would appreciate seeing how you or anyone else would do the seams on models like this, as I accept I`ve still things to learn with modeling <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img215.imageshack.us/my.php?image=image423yk4.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img215.imageshack.us/img215/9100/image423yk4.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a></div>]]></body></post><post id="p157825" date="Posted: Fri Sep 22, 2006 9:52 pm "><author>Black Dog</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Sure, .blend is fine for me.

<br /><br />if there is any vertex colors like the black to white fades we use to control texture blends, then it changes the some of the white to greens or blues, which I can`t see where they are coming from since my rock texture and the d3 dirt I was using don`t appear to have either of those colors in them.
<br /><br />I also tested the "textures/common/collision" material on some of my .ase models and it doesn`t seem to clip the player or their weapon projectiles, but some of d3`s clip materials did work, also doing a window context search of the original d3 mapobjects resulted in only .lwo models to use the collision material.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157851" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 4:17 am "><author>Black Dog</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">"Native" exporters break all the time in blender.

After spending much more time wrestling with blender than pushing uvs, here we go:
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://members.westnet.com.au/GeoffGole/temp/ratty_terrain05_03_REUNWRAPPED.blend">http://members.westnet.com.au/GeoffGole ... PPED.blend</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />I suggest that you append the object from this file rather than just opening the .blend, since it's not likely you want all my wierd settings. (Putting user interface settings in the same file as mesh data is pretty stupid). Some stuff has been ripped out to make it easier for me to work with the mesh, but don't worry about that - just take a look at the seam placement and uv layout.
<br /><br />First thing to notice is that I don't just use long, continuous seams but also some short one-ended cuts. That allows lcsm to push uvs over those seams, which helps relax stretching. In a few spots that results in mapping that is not 1 to 1, but that shouldn't be a problem when you are using an existing world texture (it's a big nono if your uvs will be used for baking/lightmapping/painting though, keep that in mind). I pushed those spots to where I thought they would be difficult to see - without knowing what your lighting and mesh position is going to be in game it's a bit difficult to know, so you'll want to make that kind of decision for yourself.
<br /><br />Secondly, the unwrapping here is pin-free and based entirely on the cuts that I've made. The only change is that the resulting uvset has been rotated and scaled a bit. If you want to play with the seam layout, just add more and unwrap again.
<br /><br />Lastly, if I was modelling this myself I'd give some thought to other methods of getting rid of seams. There's a big nasty one down the middle of the bottom of this mesh, maybe I'd move that one to where I know there'll be shadows or model a boulder to go on top of it. You pointed out yourself that you could arrange for seams to go where you've blended in the dirt texture, that would be worth looking at. You could also add another crack on the other side of the bridge, as those are perfect spots to hide seams.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157858" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 6:06 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">thanks black dog and this is very interesting <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />firstly I didn`t know we could have seams that weren`t continuous edge loops. also great idea to hide the seams in cracks, I think I can do that quite easily from now on, and a few more beveled cracks will make the rocks look more interesting. and as you also suggested, covering them up with other models like boulders.
<br /><br />I might still use the odd pin, but I think your method will save me a lot of time in the future, as my uv maps were getting messed up a lot each time I added in more polys like the cracks, because the excessive pinning I was using was restricting the uv map from automatically shifting around while doing a lscm to compensate for the new polys uv`s.
<br /><br />so was this the first time you`ve used blender or was it just my .blend file that caused you problems? either way, I very much appreciate the time you spent on helping me with this <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />did you know we can use the file browser and deselect the "load ui" button at the bottom of the file browser?
<br /><br />this means that each blender user can retain their user prefs but load in other users project data (mesh, textures, materials etc) although some of the global prefs, like the paths blender looks for textures, are saved into the .b.blend file. although even that can be backed up or over written with global prefs for different projects we might be working on.
<br /><br />I do agree though it did seem stupid at first that blender saves some user prefs into the .blend project files, but I`ve got used to it.
<br /><br />which is the main modeling app you use?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157864" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 7:08 am "><author>Black Dog</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I use blender extensively, but rather narrowly. In other words, I stick to a certain subset of features that I know very well and ignore the rest. Loading your .blend caused a few issues that I wasn't familiar with, so figuring them out took some time.
<br /><br />I did know that there was an option not to load the ui, just couldn't remember where the hell it was. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I might still use the odd pin, but I think your method will save me a lot of time in the future, as my uv maps were getting messed up a lot each time I added in more polys like the cracks, because the excessive pinning I was using was restricting the uv map from automatically shifting around while doing a lscm to compensate for the new polys uv`s.</div>
<br /><br />That's the main disadvantage of pinning.

<br /><br />I`m now using blender more then any other editor, but every week I learn something new about it or realize the potential of a feature I vaguely knew about previously. if users can get past the very steep learning curve of its interface, then it`s amazing how feature packed it is, would you agree?
<br /><br />I`ll try to not use pinning for my world models, but at least it is something I can fall back on if I struggle with the seams.
<br /><br />am I right in thinking that as long as they are well placed and hidden we could have many seams on a model, especially the one ended type, and the result would still be neat looking uv map, so instead of adding in more pins as I have been doing I add in more seams, yes?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157914" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 8:22 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I haven`t done any of the new uv mapping, so this image is just of blender`s solid view mode, but it shows the rock bridge meshes spanning across the main cave.

<br /><br />Blender is certainly full of stuff to learn. The thing is, I have no need for most of it and I'm more interested in learning to make assets than learning Blender. My focus is entirely on modelling and unwrapping and as such dealing with the complexities of the rendering or materials systems just isn't appealing. Out of all the clever things that got added in 2.42, for instance, the only ones I have real use for are the uvlayout export (decent at last!) and the very useful merge to target vertex. Now they just need to make the knife tool snap to the grid.
<br /><br />While it's possible to have many seams on a model, I don't know that more is always better. The idea is simply to have the surface look as contiguous as possible without stretching, ideally using as few seams as possible. Learning how to do that effectively is really just a matter of unwrapping a few models and seeing what works.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157962" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 5:16 pm "><author>kit89</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Looking Good Ratty. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />When it comes to UV-mapping in Blender I suggest you try the "Live UnWrap Transform" feature.

<br /><br />thanks kit89, and I had already been using "lscm live transform" which is a lot better then lscm on it`s own, if we intend to then tweak the uv`s by hand, but I now think black dog`s suggestion of first making more efficient seams on these game world models, will be the most time saving method, although I`ll still be using lscm live and pinning on non world models.
<br /><br />thinking about it, I`ll probably still use just a couple of pins on the game world models but only so I don`t have to scale, rotate and align the uv maps each time I use lscm to unwrap the model, but I don`t intend to tweak their uv`s by hand.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157991" date="Posted: Sun Sep 24, 2006 7:27 am "><author>kit89</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I'd suggest looking at this tutorial.

						<div class="postbody">zombie13, sorry it took so long, but I`ve just tested inline 1 on a couple of my .ase models.
<br /><br />if there is any vertex colors like the black to white fades we use to control texture blends, then it changes the some of the white to greens or blues, which I can`t see where they are coming from since my rock texture and the d3 dirt I was using don`t appear to have either of those colors in them.
<br /><br />I also tested the "textures/common/collision" material on some of my .ase models and it doesn`t seem to clip the player or their weapon projectiles, but some of d3`s clip materials did work, also doing a window context search of the original d3 mapobjects resulted in only .lwo models to use the collision material.</div>

						<div class="postbody">OK, I had some serious trouble with that. After spending much more time wrestling with blender than pushing uvs, here we go:
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://members.westnet.com.au/GeoffGole/temp/ratty_terrain05_03_REUNWRAPPED.blend">http://members.westnet.com.au/GeoffGole ... PPED.blend</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />I suggest that you append the object from this file rather than just opening the .blend, since it's not likely you want all my wierd settings. (Putting user interface settings in the same file as mesh data is pretty stupid). Some stuff has been ripped out to make it easier for me to work with the mesh, but don't worry about that - just take a look at the seam placement and uv layout.
<br /><br />First thing to notice is that I don't just use long, continuous seams but also some short one-ended cuts. That allows lcsm to push uvs over those seams, which helps relax stretching. In a few spots that results in mapping that is not 1 to 1, but that shouldn't be a problem when you are using an existing world texture (it's a big nono if your uvs will be used for baking/lightmapping/painting though, keep that in mind). I pushed those spots to where I thought they would be difficult to see - without knowing what your lighting and mesh position is going to be in game it's a bit difficult to know, so you'll want to make that kind of decision for yourself.
<br /><br />Secondly, the unwrapping here is pin-free and based entirely on the cuts that I've made. The only change is that the resulting uvset has been rotated and scaled a bit. If you want to play with the seam layout, just add more and unwrap again.
<br /><br />Lastly, if I was modelling this myself I'd give some thought to other methods of getting rid of seams. There's a big nasty one down the middle of the bottom of this mesh, maybe I'd move that one to where I know there'll be shadows or model a boulder to go on top of it. You pointed out yourself that you could arrange for seams to go where you've blended in the dirt texture, that would be worth looking at. You could also add another crack on the other side of the bridge, as those are perfect spots to hide seams.</div>

						<div class="postbody">thanks black dog and this is very interesting <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />firstly I didn`t know we could have seams that weren`t continuous edge loops. also great idea to hide the seams in cracks, I think I can do that quite easily from now on, and a few more beveled cracks will make the rocks look more interesting. and as you also suggested, covering them up with other models like boulders.
<br /><br />I might still use the odd pin, but I think your method will save me a lot of time in the future, as my uv maps were getting messed up a lot each time I added in more polys like the cracks, because the excessive pinning I was using was restricting the uv map from automatically shifting around while doing a lscm to compensate for the new polys uv`s.
<br /><br />so was this the first time you`ve used blender or was it just my .blend file that caused you problems? either way, I very much appreciate the time you spent on helping me with this <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />did you know we can use the file browser and deselect the "load ui" button at the bottom of the file browser?
<br /><br />this means that each blender user can retain their user prefs but load in other users project data (mesh, textures, materials etc) although some of the global prefs, like the paths blender looks for textures, are saved into the .b.blend file. although even that can be backed up or over written with global prefs for different projects we might be working on.
<br /><br />I do agree though it did seem stupid at first that blender saves some user prefs into the .blend project files, but I`ve got used to it.
<br /><br />which is the main modeling app you use?</div>

						<div class="postbody">understood black dog, and I hope I didn`t sound patronizing when telling you about "load ui" button?
<br /><br />I`m now using blender more then any other editor, but every week I learn something new about it or realize the potential of a feature I vaguely knew about previously. if users can get past the very steep learning curve of its interface, then it`s amazing how feature packed it is, would you agree?
<br /><br />I`ll try to not use pinning for my world models, but at least it is something I can fall back on if I struggle with the seams.
<br /><br />am I right in thinking that as long as they are well placed and hidden we could have many seams on a model, especially the one ended type, and the result would still be neat looking uv map, so instead of adding in more pins as I have been doing I add in more seams, yes?</div>

<br /><br />Blender is certainly full of stuff to learn. The thing is, I have no need for most of it and I'm more interested in learning to make assets than learning Blender. My focus is entirely on modelling and unwrapping and as such dealing with the complexities of the rendering or materials systems just isn't appealing. Out of all the clever things that got added in 2.42, for instance, the only ones I have real use for are the uvlayout export (decent at last!) and the very useful merge to target vertex. Now they just need to make the knife tool snap to the grid.
<br /><br />While it's possible to have many seams on a model, I don't know that more is always better. The idea is simply to have the surface look as contiguous as possible without stretching, ideally using as few seams as possible. Learning how to do that effectively is really just a matter of unwrapping a few models and seeing what works.</div>

<br /><br />thanks kit89, and I had already been using "lscm live transform" which is a lot better then lscm on it`s own, if we intend to then tweak the uv`s by hand, but I now think black dog`s suggestion of first making more efficient seams on these game world models, will be the most time saving method, although I`ll still be using lscm live and pinning on non world models.
<br /><br />thinking about it, I`ll probably still use just a couple of pins on the game world models but only so I don`t have to scale, rotate and align the uv maps each time I use lscm to unwrap the model, but I don`t intend to tweak their uv`s by hand.</div>

<br /><br />I also tested the "textures/common/collision" material on some of my .ase models and it doesn`t seem to clip the player or their weapon projectiles, but some of d3`s clip materials did work, also doing a window context search of the original d3 mapobjects resulted in only .lwo models to use the collision material.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157851" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 4:17 am "><author>Black Dog</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">"Native" exporters break all the time in blender.

After spending much more time wrestling with blender than pushing uvs, here we go:
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://members.westnet.com.au/GeoffGole/temp/ratty_terrain05_03_REUNWRAPPED.blend">http://members.westnet.com.au/GeoffGole ... PPED.blend</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />I suggest that you append the object from this file rather than just opening the .blend, since it's not likely you want all my wierd settings. (Putting user interface settings in the same file as mesh data is pretty stupid). Some stuff has been ripped out to make it easier for me to work with the mesh, but don't worry about that - just take a look at the seam placement and uv layout.
<br /><br />First thing to notice is that I don't just use long, continuous seams but also some short one-ended cuts. That allows lcsm to push uvs over those seams, which helps relax stretching. In a few spots that results in mapping that is not 1 to 1, but that shouldn't be a problem when you are using an existing world texture (it's a big nono if your uvs will be used for baking/lightmapping/painting though, keep that in mind). I pushed those spots to where I thought they would be difficult to see - without knowing what your lighting and mesh position is going to be in game it's a bit difficult to know, so you'll want to make that kind of decision for yourself.
<br /><br />Secondly, the unwrapping here is pin-free and based entirely on the cuts that I've made. The only change is that the resulting uvset has been rotated and scaled a bit. If you want to play with the seam layout, just add more and unwrap again.
<br /><br />Lastly, if I was modelling this myself I'd give some thought to other methods of getting rid of seams. There's a big nasty one down the middle of the bottom of this mesh, maybe I'd move that one to where I know there'll be shadows or model a boulder to go on top of it. You pointed out yourself that you could arrange for seams to go where you've blended in the dirt texture, that would be worth looking at. You could also add another crack on the other side of the bridge, as those are perfect spots to hide seams.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157858" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 6:06 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">thanks black dog and this is very interesting <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />firstly I didn`t know we could have seams that weren`t continuous edge loops. also great idea to hide the seams in cracks, I think I can do that quite easily from now on, and a few more beveled cracks will make the rocks look more interesting. and as you also suggested, covering them up with other models like boulders.
<br /><br />I might still use the odd pin, but I think your method will save me a lot of time in the future, as my uv maps were getting messed up a lot each time I added in more polys like the cracks, because the excessive pinning I was using was restricting the uv map from automatically shifting around while doing a lscm to compensate for the new polys uv`s.
<br /><br />so was this the first time you`ve used blender or was it just my .blend file that caused you problems? either way, I very much appreciate the time you spent on helping me with this <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />did you know we can use the file browser and deselect the "load ui" button at the bottom of the file browser?
<br /><br />this means that each blender user can retain their user prefs but load in other users project data (mesh, textures, materials etc) although some of the global prefs, like the paths blender looks for textures, are saved into the .b.blend file. although even that can be backed up or over written with global prefs for different projects we might be working on.
<br /><br />I do agree though it did seem stupid at first that blender saves some user prefs into the .blend project files, but I`ve got used to it.
<br /><br />which is the main modeling app you use?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157864" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 7:08 am "><author>Black Dog</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I use blender extensively, but rather narrowly.

<br /><br />I`m now using blender more then any other editor, but every week I learn something new about it or realize the potential of a feature I vaguely knew about previously. if users can get past the very steep learning curve of its interface, then it`s amazing how feature packed it is, would you agree?
<br /><br />I`ll try to not use pinning for my world models, but at least it is something I can fall back on if I struggle with the seams.
<br /><br />am I right in thinking that as long as they are well placed and hidden we could have many seams on a model, especially the one ended type, and the result would still be neat looking uv map, so instead of adding in more pins as I have been doing I add in more seams, yes?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157914" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 8:22 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I haven`t done any of the new uv mapping, so this image is just of blender`s solid view mode, but it shows the rock bridge meshes spanning across the main cave.

<br /><br />Blender is certainly full of stuff to learn. The thing is, I have no need for most of it and I'm more interested in learning to make assets than learning Blender. My focus is entirely on modelling and unwrapping and as such dealing with the complexities of the rendering or materials systems just isn't appealing. Out of all the clever things that got added in 2.42, for instance, the only ones I have real use for are the uvlayout export (decent at last!) and the very useful merge to target vertex. Now they just need to make the knife tool snap to the grid.
<br /><br />While it's possible to have many seams on a model, I don't know that more is always better. The idea is simply to have the surface look as contiguous as possible without stretching, ideally using as few seams as possible. Learning how to do that effectively is really just a matter of unwrapping a few models and seeing what works.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157962" date="Posted: Sat Sep 23, 2006 5:16 pm "><author>kit89</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Looking Good Ratty. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />When it comes to UV-mapping in Blender I suggest you try the "Live UnWrap Transform" feature.

<br /><br />thanks kit89, and I had already been using "lscm live transform" which is a lot better then lscm on it`s own, if we intend to then tweak the uv`s by hand, but I now think black dog`s suggestion of first making more efficient seams on these game world models, will be the most time saving method, although I`ll still be using lscm live and pinning on non world models.
<br /><br />thinking about it, I`ll probably still use just a couple of pins on the game world models but only so I don`t have to scale, rotate and align the uv maps each time I use lscm to unwrap the model, but I don`t intend to tweak their uv`s by hand.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157991" date="Posted: Sun Sep 24, 2006 7:27 am "><author>kit89</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I'd suggest looking at this tutorial.

						<div class="postbody">zombie13, sorry it took so long, but I`ve just tested inline 1 on a couple of my .ase models.
<br /><br />if there is any vertex colors like the black to white fades we use to control texture blends, then it changes the some of the white to greens or blues, which I can`t see where they are coming from since my rock texture and the d3 dirt I was using don`t appear to have either of those colors in them.
<br /><br />I also tested the "textures/common/collision" material on some of my .ase models and it doesn`t seem to clip the player or their weapon projectiles, but some of d3`s clip materials did work, also doing a window context search of the original d3 mapobjects resulted in only .lwo models to use the collision material.</div>

						<div class="postbody">OK, I had some serious trouble with that. After spending much more time wrestling with blender than pushing uvs, here we go:
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://members.westnet.com.au/GeoffGole/temp/ratty_terrain05_03_REUNWRAPPED.blend">http://members.westnet.com.au/GeoffGole ... PPED.blend</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />I suggest that you append the object from this file rather than just opening the .blend, since it's not likely you want all my wierd settings. (Putting user interface settings in the same file as mesh data is pretty stupid). Some stuff has been ripped out to make it easier for me to work with the mesh, but don't worry about that - just take a look at the seam placement and uv layout.
<br /><br />First thing to notice is that I don't just use long, continuous seams but also some short one-ended cuts. That allows lcsm to push uvs over those seams, which helps relax stretching. In a few spots that results in mapping that is not 1 to 1, but that shouldn't be a problem when you are using an existing world texture (it's a big nono if your uvs will be used for baking/lightmapping/painting though, keep that in mind). I pushed those spots to where I thought they would be difficult to see - without knowing what your lighting and mesh position is going to be in game it's a bit difficult to know, so you'll want to make that kind of decision for yourself.
<br /><br />Secondly, the unwrapping here is pin-free and based entirely on the cuts that I've made. The only change is that the resulting uvset has been rotated and scaled a bit. If you want to play with the seam layout, just add more and unwrap again.
<br /><br />Lastly, if I was modelling this myself I'd give some thought to other methods of getting rid of seams. There's a big nasty one down the middle of the bottom of this mesh, maybe I'd move that one to where I know there'll be shadows or model a boulder to go on top of it. You pointed out yourself that you could arrange for seams to go where you've blended in the dirt texture, that would be worth looking at. You could also add another crack on the other side of the bridge, as those are perfect spots to hide seams.</div>

						<div class="postbody">thanks black dog and this is very interesting <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />firstly I didn`t know we could have seams that weren`t continuous edge loops. also great idea to hide the seams in cracks, I think I can do that quite easily from now on, and a few more beveled cracks will make the rocks look more interesting. and as you also suggested, covering them up with other models like boulders.
<br /><br />I might still use the odd pin, but I think your method will save me a lot of time in the future, as my uv maps were getting messed up a lot each time I added in more polys like the cracks, because the excessive pinning I was using was restricting the uv map from automatically shifting around while doing a lscm to compensate for the new polys uv`s.
<br /><br />so was this the first time you`ve used blender or was it just my .blend file that caused you problems? either way, I very much appreciate the time you spent on helping me with this <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />did you know we can use the file browser and deselect the "load ui" button at the bottom of the file browser?
<br /><br />this means that each blender user can retain their user prefs but load in other users project data (mesh, textures, materials etc) although some of the global prefs, like the paths blender looks for textures, are saved into the .b.blend file. although even that can be backed up or over written with global prefs for different projects we might be working on.
<br /><br />I do agree though it did seem stupid at first that blender saves some user prefs into the .blend project files, but I`ve got used to it.
<br /><br />which is the main modeling app you use?</div>

						<div class="postbody">understood black dog, and I hope I didn`t sound patronizing when telling you about "load ui" button?
<br /><br />I`m now using blender more then any other editor, but every week I learn something new about it or realize the potential of a feature I vaguely knew about previously. if users can get past the very steep learning curve of its interface, then it`s amazing how feature packed it is, would you agree?
<br /><br />I`ll try to not use pinning for my world models, but at least it is something I can fall back on if I struggle with the seams.
<br /><br />am I right in thinking that as long as they are well placed and hidden we could have many seams on a model, especially the one ended type, and the result would still be neat looking uv map, so instead of adding in more pins as I have been doing I add in more seams, yes?</div>

<br /><br />Blender is certainly full of stuff to learn. The thing is, I have no need for most of it and I'm more interested in learning to make assets than learning Blender. My focus is entirely on modelling and unwrapping and as such dealing with the complexities of the rendering or materials systems just isn't appealing. Out of all the clever things that got added in 2.42, for instance, the only ones I have real use for are the uvlayout export (decent at last!) and the very useful merge to target vertex. Now they just need to make the knife tool snap to the grid.
<br /><br />While it's possible to have many seams on a model, I don't know that more is always better. The idea is simply to have the surface look as contiguous as possible without stretching, ideally using as few seams as possible. Learning how to do that effectively is really just a matter of unwrapping a few models and seeing what works.</div>

<br /><br />thanks kit89, and I had already been using "lscm live transform" which is a lot better then lscm on it`s own, if we intend to then tweak the uv`s by hand, but I now think black dog`s suggestion of first making more efficient seams on these game world models, will be the most time saving method, although I`ll still be using lscm live and pinning on non world models.
<br /><br />thinking about it, I`ll probably still use just a couple of pins on the game world models but only so I don`t have to scale, rotate and align the uv maps each time I use lscm to unwrap the model, but I don`t intend to tweak their uv`s by hand.</div>

<br /><br />in d3 the "r_showvertexcolor 1" shows a pure white model but in blender the vertex color has the top faces of the rock white fading to black for the sides and bottom of the rock.
<br /><br />could it be something to do with the seams that are preventing this from working?

<br />    thanks and I`ll try a single seam up the back of the horns, I also thought about painting details onto the texture to fit within the exact shape of the horns rather then just use a wall like texture like they apparently did with the original d3 horns/saber teeth. and I`ve been vertex blending them into a rock or dirt texture which seems to work quite well, although the scale is a bit different since the rock models use a large scale on them then the rock base of the horns.
<br /><br />    thanks for the suggestion, but I don`t think I`ll try painting out the seems, although I`ve done that before on some of the d3 character models for my personal mod. it is very time consuming especially when editing the local, height and specular textures as well as the diffuse (color) texture, not that these horns use all those material stages but it`s low priority, as plan to spend as much time on building as many models as possible, as well as all the sp game play events I have in mind <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p158133" date="Posted: Mon Sep 25, 2006 2:59 pm "><author>Black Dog</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"> one of the tasks I least enjoy when modeling my meshes is when I have two rows of verts I want to merge together along the seam, rather then all into the same vertex.

If things are nicely aligned axially, sometimes you can get away with using the scaling trick constrained to an axis and do the whole lot at once. Also if you are doing radial work, sometimes you can avoid having to handle each vertex on a curve with smart use of scaling around the cursor, which can get you close enough that remove doubles will finish the job.

<br /><br />    in fact when I first started building that rock bridge I didn`t intend the player to go up there, but I got carried away with adding detail to the top of the bridge, so have now concept designed a route which will take the player up there, hehe.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p158215" date="Posted: Tue Sep 26, 2006 3:32 pm "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">just a quick update to show the newly remapped horn model, currently using one of the original d3 textures.

<br /><br />    my conclusion is the beveled cracks to hide the uv seams on the undersides of the rock bridge and some of the floating rocks was a waste of polys, especially as the player couldn`t really see them in game unless they noclipped into the air, to get close enough to the undersides of those rocks.
<br /><br />    so when I got home from our long weekend, I merged the polys along either side of the uv seams, as well as redoing the seams and un wrapping for the first rocks I built.
<br /><br />    what I have done though is added in some beveled edges to the cracks the player is likely to see, as they are a better use of the polys I think.
<br /><br />    image shack seems slow today so I`ve only managed to ul one image so far, but will ul and post links to the finished rock bridge asap.
<br /><br />    for now here`s a blender image of the latest version of the first rock, which the player spawns onto.

<br /><br />    I also ran the blender script "uv/image editor\uv menu\texture baker" to output a version of the original pentastic1.tga texture, so in psp7 I could fade to black the inner edges where the decal sits on top of the rock`s cracks.
<br /><br />    I`m especially pleased with how I got the decal`s mesh to follow the contours of those

<br /><br />I`m pleased with how it looks in blender, but for some reason the vertex colors aren`t working on this model when loaded into blender.
<br /><br />in d3 the "r_showvertexcolor 1" shows a pure white model but in blender the vertex color has the top faces of the rock white fading to black for the sides and bottom of the rock.
<br /><br />could it be something to do with the seams that are preventing this from working?

<br /><br />    in fact when I first started building that rock bridge I didn`t intend the player to go up there, but I got carried away with adding detail to the top of the bridge, so have now concept designed a route which will take the player up there, hehe.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p158215" date="Posted: Tue Sep 26, 2006 3:32 pm "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">just a quick update to show the newly remapped horn model, currently using one of the original d3 textures.

<br /><br />    my conclusion is the beveled cracks to hide the uv seams on the undersides of the rock bridge and some of the floating rocks was a waste of polys, especially as the player couldn`t really see them in game unless they noclipped into the air, to get close enough to the undersides of those rocks.
<br /><br />    so when I got home from our long weekend, I merged the polys along either side of the uv seams, as well as redoing the seams and un wrapping for the first rocks I built.
<br /><br />    what I have done though is added in some beveled edges to the cracks the player is likely to see, as they are a better use of the polys I think.
<br /><br />    image shack seems slow today so I`ve only managed to ul one image so far, but will ul and post links to the finished rock bridge asap.
<br /><br />    for now here`s a blender image of the latest version of the first rock, which the player spawns onto.

<br /><br />    I also ran the blender script "uv/image editor\uv menu\texture baker" to output a version of the original pentastic1.tga texture, so in psp7 I could fade to black the inner edges where the decal sits on top of the rock`s cracks.
<br /><br />    I`m especially pleased with how I got the decal`s mesh to follow the contours of those

<br /><br />I`m pleased with how it looks in blender, but for some reason the vertex colors aren`t working on this model when loaded into blender.
<br /><br />in d3 the "r_showvertexcolor 1" shows a pure white model but in blender the vertex color has the top faces of the rock white fading to black for the sides and bottom of the rock.
<br /><br />could it be something to do with the seams that are preventing this from working?

Before 2.42 this kind of merging was still possible by placing the cursor near a selected vertex, snapping the cursor to the selection, making a new selection and then merging that to the cursor.

The problem with this comes when you wish to make a clean, grid aligned slice through an object with off-grid vertices. Curves are a good example.

<br /><br />    I also ran the blender script "uv/image editor\uv menu\texture baker" to output a version of the original pentastic1.tga texture, so in psp7 I could fade to black the inner edges where the decal sits on top of the rock`s cracks.

<br /><br />I`m pleased with how it looks in blender, but for some reason the vertex colors aren`t working on this model when loaded into blender.
<br /><br />in d3 the "r_showvertexcolor 1" shows a pure white model but in blender the vertex color has the top faces of the rock white fading to black for the sides and bottom of the rock.
<br /><br />could it be something to do with the seams that are preventing this from working?

<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I`m not familiar with "merge to target vertex" is it different from "merge verts to cursor" available in older versions of blender? </div><br /><br />Yes. Before 2.42 this kind of merging was still possible by placing the cursor near a selected vertex, snapping the cursor to the selection, making a new selection and then merging that to the cursor. That was a big pain in the ass. Now there's "merge to first" and "merge to last" in the merge menu, which perform this function nicely. This is particularly useful for optimising low poly work.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">regarding the (edge cutting) knife tool, I always snap the resulting cuts manually to grid using the "shift+s" popup menu, but I first have to either zoom in the 3d window to a small enough grid, or keep another 3d window on screen with a small grid size, so the snapped verts are fine enough, other wise the model comes out looking to blocky. is this similar to how you use the knife tool?</div><br /><br />Yes, I do roughly the same thing. The problem with this comes when you wish to make a clean, grid aligned slice through an object with off-grid vertices. Curves are a good example. When slicing those I always end up shuffling the new vertexes around to get them aligned, and that's not an effective way to work. Blender is entirely capable of making a clean grid-aligned cut, there's just no tool to do it at the moment.<br /><br />I sometimes resort to booleans, but they are pretty bad. The modifier stack and the recent improvements do make them more useable, but the fact that meshes must be closed and need cleaning up afterwards just kills the ease of use.<br /><br />So I'd like a knife tool that snaps to the grid.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I`m pleased with how it looks in blender, but for some reason the vertex colors aren`t working on this model when loaded into blender.</div><br /><br />The easiest way to verify that your vertex colours have exported is to load up the .ase file in a text editor and search for MESH_VERTCOL.

<br />    thanks and I`ll try a single seam up the back of the horns, I also thought about painting details onto the texture to fit within the exact shape of the horns rather then just use a wall like texture like they apparently did with the original d3 horns/saber teeth. and I`ve been vertex blending them into a rock or dirt texture which seems to work quite well, although the scale is a bit different since the rock models use a large scale on them then the rock base of the horns.
<br /><br />    thanks for the suggestion, but I don`t think I`ll try painting out the seems, although I`ve done that before on some of the d3 character models for my personal mod. it is very time consuming especially when editing the local, height and specular textures as well as the diffuse (color) texture, not that these horns use all those material stages but it`s low priority, as plan to spend as much time on building as many models as possible, as well as all the sp game play events I have in mind <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p158133" date="Posted: Mon Sep 25, 2006 2:59 pm "><author>Black Dog</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"> one of the tasks I least enjoy when modeling my meshes is when I have two rows of verts I want to merge together along the seam, rather then all into the same vertex.

<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I`m not familiar with "merge to target vertex" is it different from "merge verts to cursor" available in older versions of blender? </div><br /><br />Yes. Before 2.42 this kind of merging was still possible by placing the cursor near a selected vertex, snapping the cursor to the selection, making a new selection and then merging that to the cursor. That was a big pain in the ass. Now there's "merge to first" and "merge to last" in the merge menu, which perform this function nicely.

The problem with this comes when you wish to make a clean, grid aligned slice through an object with off-grid vertices. Curves are a good example.

The modifier stack and the recent improvements do make them more useable, but the fact that meshes must be closed and need cleaning up afterwards just kills the ease of use.<br /><br />So I'd like a knife tool that snaps to the grid.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I`m pleased with how it looks in blender, but for some reason the vertex colors aren`t working on this model when loaded into blender.</div><br /><br />The easiest way to verify that your vertex colours have exported is to load up the .ase file in a text editor and search for MESH_VERTCOL.

<br />    thanks and I`ll try a single seam up the back of the horns, I also thought about painting details onto the texture to fit within the exact shape of the horns rather then just use a wall like texture like they apparently did with the original d3 horns/saber teeth. and I`ve been vertex blending them into a rock or dirt texture which seems to work quite well, although the scale is a bit different since the rock models use a large scale on them then the rock base of the horns.
<br /><br />    thanks for the suggestion, but I don`t think I`ll try painting out the seems, although I`ve done that before on some of the d3 character models for my personal mod. it is very time consuming especially when editing the local, height and specular textures as well as the diffuse (color) texture, not that these horns use all those material stages but it`s low priority, as plan to spend as much time on building as many models as possible, as well as all the sp game play events I have in mind <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p158133" date="Posted: Mon Sep 25, 2006 2:59 pm "><author>Black Dog</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"> one of the tasks I least enjoy when modeling my meshes is when I have two rows of verts I want to merge together along the seam, rather then all into the same vertex.

If things are nicely aligned axially, sometimes you can get away with using the scaling trick constrained to an axis and do the whole lot at once. Also if you are doing radial work, sometimes you can avoid having to handle each vertex on a curve with smart use of scaling around the cursor, which can get you close enough that remove doubles will finish the job.

<br /><br />    in fact when I first started building that rock bridge I didn`t intend the player to go up there, but I got carried away with adding detail to the top of the bridge, so have now concept designed a route which will take the player up there, hehe.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p158215" date="Posted: Tue Sep 26, 2006 3:32 pm "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">just a quick update to show the newly remapped horn model, currently using one of the original d3 textures.

<br /><br />    my conclusion is the beveled cracks to hide the uv seams on the undersides of the rock bridge and some of the floating rocks was a waste of polys, especially as the player couldn`t really see them in game unless they noclipped into the air, to get close enough to the undersides of those rocks.
<br /><br />    so when I got home from our long weekend, I merged the polys along either side of the uv seams, as well as redoing the seams and un wrapping for the first rocks I built.
<br /><br />    what I have done though is added in some beveled edges to the cracks the player is likely to see, as they are a better use of the polys I think.
<br /><br />    image shack seems slow today so I`ve only managed to ul one image so far, but will ul and post links to the finished rock bridge asap.
<br /><br />    for now here`s a blender image of the latest version of the first rock, which the player spawns onto.

<br /><br />    I also ran the blender script "uv/image editor\uv menu\texture baker" to output a version of the original pentastic1.tga texture, so in psp7 I could fade to black the inner edges where the decal sits on top of the rock`s cracks.
<br /><br />    I`m especially pleased with how I got the decal`s mesh to follow the contours of those

<br />    thanks and I`ll try a single seam up the back of the horns, I also thought about painting details onto the texture to fit within the exact shape of the horns rather then just use a wall like texture like they apparently did with the original d3 horns/saber teeth. and I`ve been vertex blending them into a rock or dirt texture which seems to work quite well, although the scale is a bit different since the rock models use a large scale on them then the rock base of the horns.
<br /><br />    thanks for the suggestion, but I don`t think I`ll try painting out the seems, although I`ve done that before on some of the d3 character models for my personal mod. it is very time consuming especially when editing the local, height and specular textures as well as the diffuse (color) texture, not that these horns use all those material stages but it`s low priority, as plan to spend as much time on building as many models as possible, as well as all the sp game play events I have in mind <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p158133" date="Posted: Mon Sep 25, 2006 2:59 pm "><author>Black Dog</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"> one of the tasks I least enjoy when modeling my meshes is when I have two rows of verts I want to merge together along the seam, rather then all into the same vertex.

If things are nicely aligned axially, sometimes you can get away with using the scaling trick constrained to an axis and do the whole lot at once. Also if you are doing radial work, sometimes you can avoid having to handle each vertex on a curve with smart use of scaling around the cursor, which can get you close enough that remove doubles will finish the job. Those are only special cases though, and anywhere they don't work I typically use either merge to target vertex or merge to center on individual pairs of verts.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"> thanks for the suggestion, but I don`t think I`ll try painting out the seems</div>

<br /><br />    in fact when I first started building that rock bridge I didn`t intend the player to go up there, but I got carried away with adding detail to the top of the bridge, so have now concept designed a route which will take the player up there, hehe.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p158215" date="Posted: Tue Sep 26, 2006 3:32 pm "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">just a quick update to show the newly remapped horn model, currently using one of the original d3 textures.

<br /><br />    my conclusion is the beveled cracks to hide the uv seams on the undersides of the rock bridge and some of the floating rocks was a waste of polys, especially as the player couldn`t really see them in game unless they noclipped into the air, to get close enough to the undersides of those rocks.
<br /><br />    so when I got home from our long weekend, I merged the polys along either side of the uv seams, as well as redoing the seams and un wrapping for the first rocks I built.
<br /><br />    what I have done though is added in some beveled edges to the cracks the player is likely to see, as they are a better use of the polys I think.
<br /><br />    image shack seems slow today so I`ve only managed to ul one image so far, but will ul and post links to the finished rock bridge asap.
<br /><br />    for now here`s a blender image of the latest version of the first rock, which the player spawns onto.

<br /><br />    I also ran the blender script "uv/image editor\uv menu\texture baker" to output a version of the original pentastic1.tga texture, so in psp7 I could fade to black the inner edges where the decal sits on top of the rock`s cracks.
<br /><br />    I`m especially pleased with how I got the decal`s mesh to follow the contours of those

<br /><br />in d3 the "r_showvertexcolor 1" shows a pure white model but in blender the vertex color has the top faces of the rock white fading to black for the sides and bottom of the rock.
<br /><br />could it be something to do with the seams that are preventing this from working?

<br /><br />    in fact when I first started building that rock bridge I didn`t intend the player to go up there, but I got carried away with adding detail to the top of the bridge, so have now concept designed a route which will take the player up there, hehe.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p158215" date="Posted: Tue Sep 26, 2006 3:32 pm "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">just a quick update to show the newly remapped horn model, currently using one of the original d3 textures.

<br /><br />    my conclusion is the beveled cracks to hide the uv seams on the undersides of the rock bridge and some of the floating rocks was a waste of polys, especially as the player couldn`t really see them in game unless they noclipped into the air, to get close enough to the undersides of those rocks.
<br /><br />    so when I got home from our long weekend, I merged the polys along either side of the uv seams, as well as redoing the seams and un wrapping for the first rocks I built.
<br /><br />    what I have done though is added in some beveled edges to the cracks the player is likely to see, as they are a better use of the polys I think.
<br /><br />    image shack seems slow today so I`ve only managed to ul one image so far, but will ul and post links to the finished rock bridge asap.
<br /><br />    for now here`s a blender image of the latest version of the first rock, which the player spawns onto.

<br /><br />    I also ran the blender script "uv/image editor\uv menu\texture baker" to output a version of the original pentastic1.tga texture, so in psp7 I could fade to black the inner edges where the decal sits on top of the rock`s cracks.
<br /><br />    I`m especially pleased with how I got the decal`s mesh to follow the contours of thos

<br /><br />I`m pleased with how it looks in blender, but for some reason the vertex colors aren`t working on this model when loaded into blender.
<br /><br />in d3 the "r_showvertexcolor 1" shows a pure white model but in blender the vertex color has the top faces of the rock white fading to black for the sides and bottom of the rock.
<br /><br />could it be something to do with the seams that are preventing this from working?

<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I`m not familiar with "merge to target vertex" is it different from "merge verts to cursor" available in older versions of blender? </div><br /><br />Yes. Before 2.42 this kind of merging was still possible by placing the cursor near a selected vertex, snapping the cursor to the selection, making a new selection and then merging that to the cursor. That was a big pain in the ass. Now there's "merge to first" and "merge to last" in the merge menu, which perform this function nicely. This is particularly useful for optimising low poly work.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">regarding the (edge cutting) knife tool, I always snap the resulting cuts manually to grid using the "shift+s" popup menu, but I first have to either zoom in the 3d window to a small enough grid, or keep another 3d window on screen with a small grid size, so the snapped verts are fine enough, other wise the model comes out looking to blocky. is this similar to how you use the knife tool?</div><br /><br />Yes, I do roughly the same thing. The problem with this comes when you wish to make a clean, grid aligned slice through an object with off-grid vertices. Curves are a good example. When slicing those I always end up shuffling the new vertexes around to get them aligned, and that's not an effective way to work. Blender is entirely capable of making a clean grid-aligned cut, there's just no tool to do it at the moment.<br /><br />I sometimes resort to booleans, but they are pretty bad. The modifier stack and the recent improvements do make them more useable, but the fact that meshes must be closed and need cleaning up afterwards just kills the ease of use.<br /><br />So I'd like a knife tool that snaps to the grid.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I`m pleased with how it looks in blender, but for some reason the vertex colors aren`t working on this model when loaded into blender.</div><br /><br />The easiest way to verify that your vertex colours have exported is to load up the .ase file in a text editor and search for MESH_VERTCOL.

<br />    thanks and I`ll try a single seam up the back of the horns, I also thought about painting details onto the texture to fit within the exact shape of the horns rather then just use a wall like texture like they apparently did with the original d3 horns/saber teeth. and I`ve been vertex blending them into a rock or dirt texture which seems to work quite well, although the scale is a bit different since the rock models use a large scale on them then the rock base of the horns.
<br /><br />    thanks for the suggestion, but I don`t think I`ll try painting out the seems, although I`ve done that before on some of the d3 character models for my personal mod. it is very time consuming especially when editing the local, height and specular textures as well as the diffuse (color) texture, not that these horns use all those material stages but it`s low priority, as plan to spend as much time on building as many models as possible, as well as all the sp game play events I have in mind <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p158133" date="Posted: Mon Sep 25, 2006 2:59 pm "><author>Black Dog</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"> one of the tasks I least enjoy when modeling my meshes is when I have two rows of verts I want to merge together along the seam, rather then all into the same vertex.

<br /><br />I`m pleased with how it looks in blender, but for some reason the vertex colors aren`t working on this model when loaded into blender.
<br /><br />in d3 the "r_showvertexcolor 1" shows a pure white model but in blender the vertex color has the top faces of the rock white fading to black for the sides and bottom of the rock.
<br /><br />could it be something to do with the seams that are preventing this from working?

For the horns, you could place a seam up the back of the horns. And if all the horns skin look the same, just place them on top of each other to reduce the texture size and your horns will look identical to each other. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p158072" date="Posted: Sun Sep 24, 2006 8:08 pm "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">thanks kit89, and I`ve got a little more tweaking to the new rock I`ve been working on today but should have it finished tomorrow.

<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I`m not familiar with "merge to target vertex" is it different from "merge verts to cursor" available in older versions of blender? </div><br /><br />Yes. Before 2.42 this kind of merging was still possible by placing the cursor near a selected vertex, snapping the cursor to the selection, making a new selection and then merging that to the cursor. That was a big pain in the ass. Now there's "merge to first" and "merge to last" in the merge menu, which perform this function nicely. This is particularly useful for optimising low poly work.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">regarding the (edge cutting) knife tool, I always snap the resulting cuts manually to grid using the "shift+s" popup menu, but I first have to either zoom in the 3d window to a small enough grid, or keep another 3d window on screen with a small grid size, so the snapped verts are fine enough, other wise the model comes out looking to blocky. is this similar to how you use the knife tool?</div><br /><br />Yes, I do roughly the same thing. The problem with this comes when you wish to make a clean, grid aligned slice through an object with off-grid vertices. Curves are a good example. When slicing those I always end up shuffling the new vertexes around to get them aligned, and that's not an effective way to work. Blender is entirely capable of making a clean grid-aligned cut, there's just no tool to do it at the moment.<br /><br />I sometimes resort to booleans, but they are pretty bad. The modifier stack and the recent improvements do make them more useable, but the fact that meshes must be closed and need cleaning up afterwards just kills the ease of use.<br /><br />So I'd like a knife tool that snaps to the grid.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I`m pleased with how it looks in blender, but for some reason the vertex colors aren`t working on this model when loaded into blender.</div><br /><br />The easiest way to verify that your vertex colours have exported is to load up the .ase file in a text editor and search for MESH_VERTCOL.

<br />    thanks and I`ll try a single seam up the back of the horns, I also thought about painting details onto the texture to fit within the exact shape of the horns rather then just use a wall like texture like they apparently did with the original d3 horns/saber teeth. and I`ve been vertex blending them into a rock or dirt texture which seems to work quite well, although the scale is a bit different since the rock models use a large scale on them then the rock base of the horns.
<br /><br />    thanks for the suggestion, but I don`t think I`ll try painting out the seems, although I`ve done that before on some of the d3 character models for my personal mod. it is very time consuming especially when editing the local, height and specular textures as well as the diffuse (color) texture, not that these horns use all those material stages but it`s low priority, as plan to spend as much time on building as many models as possible, as well as all the sp game play events I have in mind <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p158133" date="Posted: Mon Sep 25, 2006 2:59 pm "><author>Black Dog</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"> one of the tasks I least enjoy when modeling my meshes is when I have two rows of verts I want to merge together along the seam, rather then all into the same vertex.

If things are nicely aligned axially, sometimes you can get away with using the scaling trick constrained to an axis and do the whole lot at once. Also if you are doing radial work, sometimes you can avoid having to handle each vertex on a curve with smart use of scaling around the cursor, which can get you close enough that remove doubles will finish the job. Those are only special cases though, and anywhere they don't work I typically use either merge to target vertex or merge to center on individual pairs of verts.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"> thanks for the suggestion, but I don`t think I`ll try painting out the seems</div>

<br /><br />    in fact when I first started building that rock bridge I didn`t intend the player to go up there, but I got carried away with adding detail to the top of the bridge, so have now concept designed a route which will take the player up there, hehe.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p158215" date="Posted: Tue Sep 26, 2006 3:32 pm "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">just a quick update to show the newly remapped horn model, currently using one of the original d3 textures.

<br /><br />    my conclusion is the beveled cracks to hide the uv seams on the undersides of the rock bridge and some of the floating rocks was a waste of polys, especially as the player couldn`t really see them in game unless they noclipped into the air, to get close enough to the undersides of those rocks.
<br /><br />    so when I got home from our long weekend, I merged the polys along either side of the uv seams, as well as redoing the seams and un wrapping for the first rocks I built.
<br /><br />    what I have done though is added in some beveled edges to the cracks the player is likely to see, as they are a better use of the polys I think.
<br /><br />    image shack seems slow today so I`ve only managed to ul one image so far, but will ul and post links to the finished rock bridge asap.
<br /><br />    for now here`s a blender image of the latest version of the first rock, which the player spawns onto.

<br /><br />    I also ran the blender script "uv/image editor\uv menu\texture baker" to output a version of the original pentastic1.tga texture, so in psp7 I could fade to black the inner edges where the decal sits on top of the rock`s cracks.
<br /><br />    I`m especially pleased with how I got the decal`s mesh to follow the contours of those

Before 2.42 this kind of merging was still possible by placing the cursor near a selected vertex, snapping the cursor to the selection, making a new selection and then merging that to the cursor. That was a big pain in the ass. Now there's "merge to first" and "merge to last" in the merge menu, which perform this function nicely.

The problem with this comes when you wish to make a clean, grid aligned slice through an object with off-grid vertices. Curves are a good example. When slicing those I always end up shuffling the new vertexes around to get them aligned, and that's not an effective way to work. Blender is entirely capable of making a clean grid-aligned cut, there's just no tool to do it at the moment.<br /><br />I sometimes resort to booleans, but they are pretty bad. The modifier stack and the recent improvements do make them more useable, but the fact that meshes must be closed and need cleaning up afterwards just kills the ease of use.<br /><br />So I'd like a knife tool that snaps to the grid.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I`m pleased with how it looks in blender, but for some reason the vertex colors aren`t working on this model when loaded into blender.</div><br /><br />The easiest way to verify that your vertex colours have exported is to load up the .ase file in a text editor and search for MESH_VERTCOL.

If things are nicely aligned axially, sometimes you can get away with using the scaling trick constrained to an axis and do the whole lot at once. Also if you are doing radial work, sometimes you can avoid having to handle each vertex on a curve with smart use of scaling around the cursor, which can get you close enough that remove doubles will finish the job.

<br /><br />I do accept not everyone would say want the player skin and particle effects, so if they are in separate .pk4`s then players can choose which parts of my mod they want to use.
<br /><br />here`s an older d3 test map I was working on last year, which might show more clearly my version of the d3 player skin, I`ve used the same dark grey and chrome theme for the d3xp version as well.

<br /><br />I`ve also redone a lot of the particle effects, like imp, hellknight and vulgar fireballs, bullet sparks, plasmagun trails, some explosions etc. which I`ll try to show in screen images when this map is more populated with monsters.
<br /><br />I do accept not everyone would say want the player skin and particle effects, so if they are in separate .pk4`s then players can choose which parts of my mod they want to use.
<br /><br />here`s an older d3 test map I was working on last year, which might show more clearly my version of the d3 player skin, I`ve used the same dark grey and chrome theme for the d3xp version as well. I`m not sure what you mean by his hairs as I didn`t alter the head or arms part of the original textures.

<br /><br />last week and today I got some more modeling done to the hell map, but I also spent another long weekend with my girlfriend, this time in her home town of milton keynes.
<br /><br />we`re now planning for me to move up there over the next couple of weeks, so I`m not sure how much of the hell map I`ll get done until I`m fully set up in her flat. although she does have broadband which will be a welcome upgrade from my 56k I`ve been using for years.
<br /><br />the hell map is at the top of my project list and it will definitely get released oneday, in the mean time I`ll do as much as I can to it when ever possible and keep you people here updated.
<br /><br />I do have a new technical issue I`d like help with.
<br /><br />in these screen images, your see I have built a tunnel entrance into the rock walls at the bottom of the main cave, with the lava flowing into the tunnel. but as the tunnel slopes downwards, I`m having difficulty with the lava fog lights as having two next to each other doesn`t look good in game, I assume because we can see the sides of the fog volume.
<br /><br />is there a way to simulate the fog following the contours of the lava or should I leave out the fog lights?

<br /><br />last week and today I got some more modeling done to the hell map, but I also spent another long weekend with my girlfriend, this time in her home town of milton keynes.
<br /><br />we`re now planning for me to move up there over the next couple of weeks, so I`m not sure how much of the hell map I`ll get done until I`m fully set up in her flat. although she does have broadband which will be a welcome upgrade from my 56k I`ve been using for years.
<br /><br />the hell map is at the top of my project list and it will definitely get released oneday, in the mean time I`ll do as much as I can to it when ever possible and keep you people here updated.
<br /><br />I do have a new technical issue I`d like help with.
<br /><br />in these screen images, your see I have built a tunnel entrance into the rock walls at the bottom of the main cave, with the lava flowing into the tunnel. but as the tunnel slopes downwards, I`m having difficulty with the lava fog lights as having two next to each other doesn`t look good in game, I assume because we can see the sides of the fog volume.
<br /><br />is there a way to simulate the fog following the contours of the lava or should I leave out the fog lights?

<br /><br />If your able to get really close to the lava, I would suggest creating a script that at a certain distance removes the fog &amp;/or smoke and creates a light heat wave affect infront of the player.

<br /><br />I`ve also redone a lot of the particle effects, like imp, hellknight and vulgar fireballs, bullet sparks, plasmagun trails, some explosions etc. which I`ll try to show in screen images when this map is more populated with monsters.
<br /><br />I do accept not everyone would say want the player skin and particle effects, so if they are in separate .pk4`s then players can choose which parts of my mod they want to use.
<br /><br />here`s an older d3 test map I was working on last year, which might show more clearly my version of the d3 player skin, I`ve used the same dark grey and chrome theme for the d3xp version as well. I`m not sure what you mean by his hairs as I didn`t alter the head or arms part of the original textures.

<br /><br />last week and today I got some more modeling done to the hell map, but I also spent another long weekend with my girlfriend, this time in her home town of milton keynes.
<br /><br />we`re now planning for me to move up there over the next couple of weeks, so I`m not sure how much of the hell map I`ll get done until I`m fully set up in her flat. although she does have broadband which will be a welcome upgrade from my 56k I`ve been using for years.
<br /><br />the hell map is at the top of my project list and it will definitely get released oneday, in the mean time I`ll do as much as I can to it when ever possible and keep you people here updated.
<br /><br />I do have a new technical issue I`d like help with.
<br /><br />in these screen images, your see I have built a tunnel entrance into the rock walls at the bottom of the main cave, with the lava flowing into the tunnel. but as the tunnel slopes downwards, I`m having difficulty with the lava fog lights as having two next to each other doesn`t look good in game, I assume because we can see the sides of the fog volume.
<br /><br />is there a way to simulate the fog following the contours of the lava or should I leave out the fog lights?

<br /><br />I`ve also redone a lot of the particle effects, like imp, hellknight and vulgar fireballs, bullet sparks, plasmagun trails, some explosions etc. which I`ll try to show in screen images when this map is more populated with monsters.
<br /><br />I do accept not everyone would say want the player skin and particle effects, so if they are in separate .pk4`s then players can choose which parts of my mod they want to use.
<br /><br />here`s an older d3 test map I was working on last year, which might show more clearly my version of the d3 player skin, I`ve used the same dark grey and chrome theme for the d3xp version as well. I`m not sure what you mean by his hairs as I didn`t alter the head or arms part of the original textures.

<br /><br />I`ve also redone a lot of the particle effects, like imp, hellknight and vulgar fireballs, bullet sparks, plasmagun trails, some explosions etc. which I`ll try to show in screen images when this map is more populated with monsters.
<br /><br />I do accept not everyone would say want the player skin and particle effects, so if they are in separate .pk4`s then players can choose which parts of my mod they want to use.
<br /><br />here`s an older d3 test map I was working on last year, which might show more clearly my version of the d3 player skin, I`ve used the same dark grey and chrome theme for the d3xp version as well. I`m not sure what you mean by his hairs as I didn`t alter the head or arms part of the original textures.

<br /><br />last week and today I got some more modeling done to the hell map, but I also spent another long weekend with my girlfriend, this time in her home town of milton keynes.
<br /><br />we`re now planning for me to move up there over the next couple of weeks, so I`m not sure how much of the hell map I`ll get done until I`m fully set up in her flat. although she does have broadband which will be a welcome upgrade from my 56k I`ve been using for years.
<br /><br />the hell map is at the top of my project list and it will definitely get released oneday, in the mean time I`ll do as much as I can to it when ever possible and keep you people here updated.
<br /><br />I do have a new technical issue I`d like help with.
<br /><br />in these screen images, your see I have built a tunnel entrance into the rock walls at the bottom of the main cave, with the lava flowing into the tunnel. but as the tunnel slopes downwards, I`m having difficulty with the lava fog lights as having two next to each other doesn`t look good in game, I assume because we can see the sides of the fog volume.
<br /><br />is there a way to simulate the fog following the contours of the lava or should I leave out the fog lights?

<br /><br />I do accept not everyone would say want the player skin and particle effects, so if they are in separate .pk4`s then players can choose which parts of my mod they want to use.
<br /><br />here`s an older d3 test map I was working on last year, which might show more clearly my version of the d3 player skin, I`ve used the same dark grey and chrome theme for the d3xp version as well.

<br /><br />last week and today I got some more modeling done to the hell map, but I also spent another long weekend with my girlfriend, this time in her home town of milton keynes.
<br /><br />we`re now planning for me to move up there over the next couple of weeks, so I`m not sure how much of the hell map I`ll get done until I`m fully set up in her flat. although she does have broadband which will be a welcome upgrade from my 56k I`ve been using for years.
<br /><br />the hell map is at the top of my project list and it will definitely get released oneday, in the mean time I`ll do as much as I can to it when ever possible and keep you people here updated.
<br /><br />I do have a new technical issue I`d like help with.
<br /><br />in these screen images, your see I have built a tunnel entrance into the rock walls at the bottom of the main cave, with the lava flowing into the tunnel. but as the tunnel slopes downwards, I`m having difficulty with the lava fog lights as having two next to each other doesn`t look good in game, I assume because we can see the sides of the fog volume.
<br /><br />is there a way to simulate the fog following the contours of the lava or should I leave out the fog lights?

<br /><br />If your able to get really close to the lava, I would suggest creating a script that at a certain distance removes the fog &amp;/or smoke and creates a light heat wave affect infront of the player.

<br /><br />I`ve also redone a lot of the particle effects, like imp, hellknight and vulgar fireballs, bullet sparks, plasmagun trails, some explosions etc. which I`ll try to show in screen images when this map is more populated with monsters.
<br /><br />I do accept not everyone would say want the player skin and particle effects, so if they are in separate .pk4`s then players can choose which parts of my mod they want to use.
<br /><br />here`s an older d3 test map I was working on last year, which might show more clearly my version of the d3 player skin, I`ve used the same dark grey and chrome theme for the d3xp version as well.

<br /><br />I`ve also redone a lot of the particle effects, like imp, hellknight and vulgar fireballs, bullet sparks, plasmagun trails, some explosions etc. which I`ll try to show in screen images when this map is more populated with monsters.
<br /><br />I do accept not everyone would say want the player skin and particle effects, so if they are in separate .pk4`s then players can choose which parts of my mod they want to use.
<br /><br />here`s an older d3 test map I was working on last year, which might show more clearly my version of the d3 player skin, I`ve used the same dark grey and chrome theme for the d3xp version as well. I`m not sure what you mean by his hairs as I didn`t alter the head or arms part of the original textures.

<br /><br />last week and today I got some more modeling done to the hell map, but I also spent another long weekend with my girlfriend, this time in her home town of milton keynes.
<br /><br />we`re now planning for me to move up there over the next couple of weeks, so I`m not sure how much of the hell map I`ll get done until I`m fully set up in her flat. although she does have broadband which will be a welcome upgrade from my 56k I`ve been using for years.
<br /><br />the hell map is at the top of my project list and it will definitely get released oneday, in the mean time I`ll do as much as I can to it when ever possible and keep you people here updated.
<br /><br />I do have a new technical issue I`d like help with.
<br /><br />in these screen images, your see I have built a tunnel entrance into the rock walls at the bottom of the main cave, with the lava flowing into the tunnel. but as the tunnel slopes downwards, I`m having difficulty with the lava fog lights as having two next to each other doesn`t look good in game, I assume because we can see the sides of the fog volume.
<br /><br />is there a way to simulate the fog following the contours of the lava or should I leave out the fog lights?

<br /><br />I`ve also redone a lot of the particle effects, like imp, hellknight and vulgar fireballs, bullet sparks, plasmagun trails, some explosions etc. which I`ll try to show in screen images when this map is more populated with monsters.
<br /><br />I do accept not everyone would say want the player skin and particle effects, so if they are in separate .pk4`s then players can choose which parts of my mod they want to use.
<br /><br />here`s an older d3 test map I was working on last year, which might show more clearly my version of the d3 player skin, I`ve used the same dark grey and chrome theme for the d3xp version as well. I`m not sure what you mean by his hairs as I didn`t alter the head or arms part of the original textures.

<br /><br />last week and today I got some more modeling done to the hell map, but I also spent another long weekend with my girlfriend, this time in her home town of milton keynes.
<br /><br />we`re now planning for me to move up there over the next couple of weeks, so I`m not sure how much of the hell map I`ll get done until I`m fully set up in her flat. although she does have broadband which will be a welcome upgrade from my 56k I`ve been using for years.
<br /><br />the hell map is at the top of my project list and it will definitely get released oneday, in the mean time I`ll do as much as I can to it when ever possible and keep you people here updated.
<br /><br />I do have a new technical issue I`d like help with.
<br /><br />in these screen images, your see I have built a tunnel entrance into the rock walls at the bottom of the main cave, with the lava flowing into the tunnel. but as the tunnel slopes downwards, I`m having difficulty with the lava fog lights as having two next to each other doesn`t look good in game, I assume because we can see the sides of the fog volume.
<br /><br />is there a way to simulate the fog following the contours of the lava or should I leave out the fog lights?

<br /><br />    and although I spent a lot of time on experimenting where to place the uv seams, I still ended up tweaking the uv map a lot which I haven`t had to do recently with the rock or terrain models.
<br /><br />    but while working on this hell cage I discovered the very useful "w key/align x or y" tool in the uv/image editor window. this ment I could quickly clean up the hell cage metal bars uv`s. so before I started bending them out of shape, I had a wip version where the uv`s were very neatly mapped to the polys with hardly any stretching, and after bending the bars I`m still very pleased with the uv map <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />    hopefully the next one of these cages I build I`ll be able to model and uv map it a lot quicker.

<br/><br/>
also various users have found different d3 paths work or don`t work for them, for me personally, I have all my .ase models use the "w:/doom/base/" prefix for the texture paths which works perfectly on my system, although I think kat uses one of the others.&#13;
<br/><br/>
the weird thing is I don`t have a w: drive or partition so it must be something coded into the engine from when they were developing it, but I remember I had great difficultly getting d3 to use my custom paths before using the prefix.&#13;
<br/><br/>
sorry if you already know the above fix, but someone reading this might not be even aware of this export issue let alone the fixes.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=17180&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=0" target="_blank" class="postlink">(wip) ratty d3 hell map</a>&#13;

Goofos, I think I understand but could you post an example of a material shader and the material name you`d use in blender, or if you don`t want to in this thread, perhaps a link to an example in your .ase exporter`s development thread?<br/>_________________<br/><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=17180&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=0" target="_blank" class="postlink">(wip) ratty d3 hell map</a>&#13;

<br/><br/>
    and although I spent a lot of time on experimenting where to place the uv seams, I still ended up tweaking the uv map a lot which I haven`t had to do recently with the rock or terrain models.&#13;
<br/><br/>
    but while working on this hell cage I discovered the very useful "w key/align x or y" tool in the uv/image editor window. this ment I could quickly clean up the hell cage metal bars uv`s. so before I started bending them out of shape, I had a wip version where the uv`s were very neatly mapped to the polys with hardly any stretching, and after bending the bars I`m still very pleased with the uv map <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0"/><br/><br/>

2. a image for texturing in Blender, stored in the path&#13;

3. in Blender a Material for your mesh with a Texture into which you load that image (once loaded you can select it in the UV editor)&#13;
<br/><br/>
If you export the model, you dont need to change the *BITMAP lines because it have a usable path doom3 can interpret as material. The only important thing is you have to store the image in the right path: &#13;

<br /><br />also various users have found different d3 paths work or don`t work for them, for me personally, I have all my .ase models use the "w:/doom/base/" prefix for the texture paths which works perfectly on my system, although I think kat uses one of the others.
<br /><br />the weird thing is I don`t have a w: drive or partition so it must be something coded into the engine from when they were developing it, but I remember I had great difficultly getting d3 to use my custom paths before using the prefix.

<br /><br />    and although I spent a lot of time on experimenting where to place the uv seams, I still ended up tweaking the uv map a lot which I haven`t had to do recently with the rock or terrain models.
<br /><br />    but while working on this hell cage I discovered the very useful "w key/align x or y" tool in the uv/image editor window. this ment I could quickly clean up the hell cage metal bars uv`s. so before I started bending them out of shape, I had a wip version where the uv`s were very neatly mapped to the polys with hardly any stretching, and after bending the bars I`m still very pleased with the uv map <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />    hopefully the next one of these cages I build I`ll be able to model and uv map it a lot quicker.

<br/><br/>
also various users have found different d3 paths work or don`t work for them, for me personally, I have all my .ase models use the "w:/doom/base/" prefix for the texture paths which works perfectly on my system, although I think kat uses one of the others.&#13;
<br/><br/>
the weird thing is I don`t have a w: drive or partition so it must be something coded into the engine from when they were developing it, but I remember I had great difficultly getting d3 to use my custom paths before using the prefix.&#13;
