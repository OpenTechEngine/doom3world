In other words, it will likely map with everything off, that includes shadows, the biggest killer of frame rate in the editor. So, you will be mapping with very old standards and everything disabled.<br /><br />You can run Quake 4 just about if you drop everything down... But like I said, Q4Rad is different to Q4. Just because you can run one doesnt mean the other will be fine. Q4Rad doesn't display portals/hints etc, which means it renders the whole thing in one go. It will be even worse when you use real time preview.<br /><br />Its your card man, simple as that. Its far too old to be keeping up to speed these days, and there isn't much to do about it.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p222079" date="Posted: Tue Jan 26, 2010 3:26 pm "><author>BloodRayne</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Gavavva speaks the truth.

Especially in larger spaces (medium size outdoor scenery for example) brushes only become visible when selected, most times there is nothing visible in the cam view. Same with render mode, which almost doesn´t work at all in larger areas, and it doesn´t do anything when I update render view with F4.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p222460" date="Posted: Wed Feb 10, 2010 7:12 pm "><author>gavavva</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Cubic clipping.
