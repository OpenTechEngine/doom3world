<br /><br />I want to present you a SP project I'm currently working on with my partner "Psychokiller" from the Doom3 RTH team. We've been working on it for 2 weeks now and have some stuff we'd like to show you <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320003942im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Here is a short description of the story: 
<br />The "Soul Gems" are three mystic stones. Every stone stands for a virtue and gives the player a specific amount of power. Without knowing it Tommy is the key to these stones and gets into a deadly game that threatens the fate of earth. 
<br />The player can look forward to fighting against the aliens again in atmospheric levels with varied gameplay and an exciting story that ties in with Prey.
<br /><br />And here are some screens. Hope you like them <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320003942im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320003942/http://img421.imageshack.us/img421/4821/sgemakx7.jpg">http://img421.imageshack.us/img421/4821/sgemakx7.jpg</a><!-- m -->

<br /><br />I want to present you a SP project I'm currently working on with my partner "Psychokiller" from the Doom3 RTH team. We've been working on it for 2 weeks now and have some stuff we'd like to show you <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320011214im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Here is a short description of the story: 
<br />The "Soul Gems" are three mystic stones. Every stone stands for a virtue and gives the player a specific amount of power. Without knowing it Tommy is the key to these stones and gets into a deadly game that threatens the fate of earth. 
<br />The player can look forward to fighting against the aliens again in atmospheric levels with varied gameplay and an exciting story that ties in with Prey.
<br /><br />And here are some screens. Hope you like them <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320011214im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320011214/http://img421.imageshack.us/img421/4821/sgemakx7.jpg">http://img421.imageshack.us/img421/4821/sgemakx7.jpg</a><!-- m -->
