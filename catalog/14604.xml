<br /><br />i saw this in a hl2 forum whiule researching water shaders:
<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic">"1.) In order to make reflective water, you will need to add an env_cubemap point entity at least 16 units above your water face.<br /><br />2.) Go into the env_cubemap properties and go to the Brush Faces property. Click the "Pick" button and select the face of your water with the dropper.<br /><br />That should do it. Now you have reflective water."</span></div>]]></body></post><post id="p133200" date="Posted: Tue Feb 14, 2006 4:54 pm "><author>pbmax</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">found the answer already  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225064437im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" /><br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225064437/http://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Adding_Water">http://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Adding_Water</a><!-- m -->
