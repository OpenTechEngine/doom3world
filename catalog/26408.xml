I want to localize d3bfg on my language.<br />I already have translated sound from old d3 and roe, but it is on ogg format.<br />D3 bfg uses idwav format on pc, and idxma on xbox.<br />But i see in *.sndshd files - what's the use of wav files...<br />And i don't understand - why in game specify the use of one file's type - wav, but game uses ogg files in old <br />d3,  idwav on pc and idxma in xbox... What does it mean? How  game can identify which file's format  need to use? Why pc version ignores the existence of idxma files on pc? (I take xbox's sound.resources file for test).<br />I  need to get the game on the PC or use ogg files or idxma with xbox.<br />Or somewhere to get the converter from ogg to idwav. Either make the game take just wav files, not idwav ...<br />Have any ideas?<br /><br />I do not understand why the game searches for  idwav files in bfg edition although *.sndshd spelled wav ...<br /><br />In some of the files are specified using exactly idwav?<br />In the original doom 3 I realized the same thing ... wav written and used somehow ogg. How do I get the game to take the files in the correct format to me?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p245952" date="Posted: Tue Jan 08, 2013 10:56 am "><author>Evelen</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Hello.
