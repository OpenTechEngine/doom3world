A lot of stuff was possible, but everything was difficult, control "felt" wrong... I'm not sure what it is, but it was always a painful experience to me to model anything on radiant.

I've never used it before, but to my surprise, after some little time getting used to it, the whole interface and modeling operation became very fluid. Maybe it was the fact that, save for a few advanced features like patch editing, you're just building blocks on the editor - Quake 1 style - or maybe because it had all the viewports by default - I'm too used to 3dsmax I guess - but I was able to build maps much faster and have them look pretty nice thanks to the compiled radiosity without much hassle.<br /><br />So I don't have any good advice to give, I'm just of the opinion that once you adapt to it, it goes really smooth.

Then Doom3 came along and I forced myself to change engine, HL2 wasn't out and I wanted to work with some cool new technology.<br /><br />In a lot of my earlier posts here where people were talking about Hammer Vs D3Edit, I used to say that radiant was more technical to use and hammer was easier to pick up.

With patches you have direct control over each individual vert, whereas the displacement tool has a paint-like interface. I can see the benifit of this for large areas, but its very frustrating to use on smaller details compared to the vertex accuracy of the patch mesh tool.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p189371" date="Posted: Sun Sep 30, 2007 3:17 am "><author>Paveway</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">My view is exactly 180 from your topic title... about 2 years ago. Years and years ago when I first got into level editing I was using hammer editor for half-life. I got very comfortable using it, so when I tried to get into radiant stuff (Doom 3) I found it very difficult to switch. It was hard to grasp that you were always creating a new block every time you click dragged on the grid. But I got past it and eventually switched. Now I'd have to agree with you, I hate using the hammer editor, it does take like 3 steps just to create one block. <br /><br />Though I wouldn't say one is necessarily "better" than the other, I'd say that hammer is more immediately user friendly and interface friendly, but that radiant is much more intuitive in terms of building, but that the interface is more difficult to use. Radiant is definitely NOT newbie friendly. <br /><br />Personally I can build rooms about 2x quicker in radiant than I ever could in hammer, and I'd never go back to hammer unless I had to.

Though the fact that anything associated with Doom3 has crappy documentation (especially the editor), has made it hard to learn all the neat little tricks radiant has to offer.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p189426" date="Posted: Sun Sep 30, 2007 9:51 pm "><author>Gazado</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Gotta say I 100% share your views Paveway  -  its identicle to the way I progressed onto D3edit <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225071157im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p190178" date="Posted: Tue Oct 16, 2007 5:03 am "><author>revility</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I haven't touched hammer since mapping for TFC  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225071157im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />hammer is more friendly looking, but not as quick as radiant.  It felt at the time more mouse based than keyboard based.  Scripting wise is was great back then too.<br /><br />Radiant vs hammer is similar to milkshape VS blender.  One is friendly looking &amp; mouse driven, the other is keyboard driven &amp; can look alien so it scares people off.  Then you have to look at the complexity of the games that are made with each one. <br />Milkshape and hammer are ment for simple geometry.  Blender &amp; rad are for higher detailed stuff.<br />Radiant has been used for games with super hi tech looking levels and super detailed gothic maps.  Hammer is based around a game in modern times where detail and geometry is quite simple.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p190702" date="Posted: Fri Oct 26, 2007 3:08 pm "><author>jizaboz</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">My thing is trying to test a map that I've made in hammer. I get everything set up but I can not figure out how to get people to connect to my listen server to save my life. I wasted a whole day messing with router settings and issuing server commands just so a friend and I could test a stupid box map LOL. Eventually I said bah screw this. (Of course I'm all ears if someone knows the trick heh-heh) It just seemed ridiculous to me considering with Doom 3 you just clear one port and bam done.</div>]]></body></post></posts></thread></xml>
