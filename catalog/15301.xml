<br /><br />I must say that I completely disagree with upper statement. I think that the game is absolutely ok. Unfortunately it’s too short, but I must admit that I was havening much more fun for those 4 -5h of playing episode one then the whole original HL2 game. However I really don’t want to explain here why is my opinion so much different. But as a man who is following the game industry from the time of the ZX Spectrum 48k until these very days, and also as an Art pro I’ll just say that my opinion should have some weights for others. So I’ll just say that it is probably the best solution for many people who prefer Doom instead HL2 to check carefully first complete media material before they decide to buy HL2 E1. 
<br /><br />For those who didn’t buy E1 until now and still thinking what to do, I’ll say that it will be probably the best solution if you wait until the second episode shows up. Than you will be able to buy both episodes at once and technically you will have 8 to10h (perhaps even more) of pure fun…
