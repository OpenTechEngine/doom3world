It's a very simple torch model (basicaly just a cylinder).
<br />I've got a low-poly version and a high poly version.
<br />I've ripped the UVs on the low poly model. 
<br />I've written a .mtr file (basicaly just copied it from the Id sdk and changed the paths and files) 
<br />I go into q4 and try to run the "renderbump."
<br />It gives me a message along the lines of "surface 0 =shader _emptyname, and then it does nothing. 
<br /><br />In the Id SDK theres a step where you have to assign the shader to the surface of your model.  I'm assuming that the "_empyname" part means that I haven't assigned it correctly, therefore it's not calling the .mtr and therefore it's not rendering a bumpmap. 
<br />The SDK tutorials use lightwave, I'm using 3ds Max6.  I've tried just putting the line in from the .mtr in the material name, but that doesn't work. 
<br />Can anybody tell me how to assign the SHADER to the surface of my model in 3dMax... or anything else i'm doing wrong or dont understand.
<br />(The model loads into modview, but just without any skin.)  
<br />This is probably a dumb question, but it's driving me nuts.
<br />Nother thing, I don't have to rip the UVs on the high poly version do I?
<br />Thx</div>]]></body></post><post id="p154962" date="Posted: Fri Aug 25, 2006 8:07 pm "><author>efx</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">This is not my area of expertise and renderbump is giving me major issues though I can get it to render at least.
<br /><br />What I do is I assign the model in Max a temporary bitmap and then I edit the .ase file manually to point to the material in my .mtr file. That works for me.
<br /><br />How does your material shader look?
