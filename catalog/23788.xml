HDR has it's own bloom solution.<br /><br />@Alexthegr81 &amp; @BloodRayne:<br /> I had to jump through hoops to get post processes to work correctly with Q4. I had these same scaling issues before I fixed them but since I'm on an Ati now, fixing them for me may have broken them for nVidia cards. Do either of you have access to an Ati card to see if you still have problems? This would be the best way to start and narrow down the root of the problem. Screenshots would also help me see what it's doing exactly. Alexthegr81, if you are using the default HDR values or close to them (especially for lum_min/max variables) and you are not using ldr bloom in conjunction with it, I'm assuming that your problem has to do with scaling as well. If the luminance texture is scaled wrong as it's being shaded you'll get a wrong average scene luminance.

Alexthegr81, if you are using the default HDR values or close to them (especially for lum_min/max variables) and you are not using ldr bloom in conjunction with it, I'm assuming that your problem has to do with scaling as well. If the luminance texture is scaled wrong as it's being shaded you'll get a wrong average scene luminance. BloodRayne, Does turning on two or more effects still cause it to draw in the bottom left corner?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p226044" date="Posted: Mon Aug 02, 2010 5:21 pm "><author>BloodRayne</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I'll make screenshots for you tonight.
