She's been asked at least 4 times on the campaign trail and still can't get it right.  She still thinks the VP slot has powers it does not, she still thinks it gives her a right to meddle in the Senate.  She still thinks it has some sort of "other duties as assigned by the president" powers and thinks it has the power to "oversee the Senate."  <br /><br />Here's what the VP's role really is, according to the Constitution of the United States:<br /><br />The Constitution, Article 1, Section 3 states:<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">The Vice President of the United States shall be President of the Senate, but shall have no vote, unless they be equally divided. </div><br /><br />Article 2, Section 1 states:<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">In Case of the Removal of the President from Office, or of his Death, Resignation, or Inability to discharge the Powers and Duties of the said Office, the Same shall devolve on the Vice President...</div><br /><br />The 20th Amendment references the VP, too:<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">The terms of the President and Vice President shall end at noon on the 20th day of January...</div><br /><br />And finally, the 25th Amendment:<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">In case of the removal of the President from office or of his death or resignation, the Vice President shall become President.</div><br /><br />Wow... how is this woman qualified, at all, to be VP?
