<br /><br /><br />That's just plain wrong. The only way that most of the id engines are based on each other is from what remains in Carmack's mind.

<br />Carmack does write new engines from scratch sometimes, but Quake 2 was not done from scratch and I'm pretty sure that Quake 3 wasn't done entirely from scratch either (close to it, though, if memory serves).
<br /><br />If you want to be philosophical about it, then we could reason that Carmack could never create a graphics engine from scratch because he's always drawing upon knowledge from the previous engines he created.

<br /><br />Did you happen to notice my post before that one. I'm the one that originally said all the Quake engines are largely rewrites. Anyway, the part I was inquiring about was the comment you made about the console being all from Quake3. I mean certainly there's a lot of empirical evidence to support that, just the matter of fact way you said it lead me to believe maybe there was an interview I missed somewhere. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225072218im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p63751" date="Posted: Fri Nov 19, 2004 12:24 am "><author>kat</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">slightly OT (probably a slightly stupid question as well but..).. does all this mean id get royalties from HL2 sales if the engine contains 'snippets' or ideas based on the HL code (and thus based on licenced material from id)???</div>]]></body></post><post id="p63774" date="Posted: Fri Nov 19, 2004 2:35 am "><author>bosco</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">kat wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">slightly OT (probably a slightly stupid question as well but..).. does all this mean id get royalties from HL2 sales if the engine contains 'snippets' or ideas based on the HL code (and thus based on licenced material from id)???</div>
<br /><br />Well considering the Quake engine can be licensed for a flat $10,000 fee now I would doubt it requires royalty payment. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225072218im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p63819" date="Posted: Fri Nov 19, 2004 12:44 pm "><author>zeh</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Did you happen to notice my post before that one.

<br /><br />Oh, ok, no, there's no interview mentioning that. It was just a personal example.
<br /><br />I also believe all engines are rewrites, but some of them are .. to a larger degree.

<br /><br />That's true. Certainly licensing the Quake 1 engine doesn't get you the Quake 2 engine when it comes out. I think the person that made that statement is mistaken. At best, you get revisions and updates that are made to THAT code base, often times by other companies that are working closely with id.

<br /><br />That's true. Certainly licensing the Quake 1 engine doesn't get you the Quake 2 engine when it comes out. I think the person that made that statement is mistaken.

By the time they were ready to work on it, things were basically functional.

After the renderer was functional and the other programmers came off of TA and Wolf, the rest of the codebase got rewritten. Especially after our move to C++, there is very little code remaining from the Q3 codebase at this point. "

The gamecode is EXTREMELY different, as is the renderer.  Don't know about the net code, but given all of the physics stuff, it's probably pretty different.
<br /><br />HL2 on the other hand... Anyone who's seen the source code leak can testify that they basically took HL1, wrote a new file access backend and renderer, then bolted about $200,000,000 of proprietary SDKs on to it.  The gamecode even uses old HL1 callbacks and uses the old frame/edict based networking stuff.  The map format is an attrocious blend of HL1 BSP with displacement-mapped terrain and static meshes.  If you wondered why HL2's levels were so short, there's why.
<br /><br />Why do this?  Why do you think?  Not to shorten development, but rather so they could milk every last penny they could out of Half-Life and Counter-Strike.  How do you think they "remastered" the original Half-Life so quickly?

<br /><br />Shame they are the industry leaders right now, then.  It's hypocritical of you to slag off Valve, yet simultaneously be totally behind games which are designed to tick a load of boxes which didn't even exist before HL.
<br /><br />As for graphics, as long as they are fairly competitive, so what, really?  HL2 looked great in places (IMO, hi-res lightmaps can still occasionally yield an edge over stencil shadows due to radiosity), Doom3 looked very good overall and Quake4 at it's best looked as good as Doom3 and OK otherwise.  My favourite game of the lot though? Q4.  You can bet it will have more impact than Doom3, but it's not down to the graphics.
<br /><br />I don't particularly like Valve's approach (if anything, I blame them for a lot), but  I appreciate that it exemplifies many of the defining trends in the modern FPS, which other games just imitate.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p126626" date="Posted: Thu Dec 22, 2005 10:14 pm "><author>Exitus</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">No, it is not.

<br /><br /><br />That's just plain wrong. The only way that most of the id engines are based on each other is from what remains in Carmack's mind.

<br />Carmack does write new engines from scratch sometimes, but Quake 2 was not done from scratch and I'm pretty sure that Quake 3 wasn't done entirely from scratch either (close to it, though, if memory serves).
<br /><br />If you want to be philosophical about it, then we could reason that Carmack could never create a graphics engine from scratch because he's always drawing upon knowledge from the previous engines he created.

Anyone familiar with id tech will recognise what those func_* thingies are, let alone the terms BSP, PVS, lightmap, blocksize, detail brush.

The Quake 2 code was wrote on top of the Quake 1 code, whereas the Quake 3 code was rewrote from scratch as much as possible. The D3 code was rewrote from scratch in that sense too, but the console shell is all from Q3 (for example).
<br /><br />HL1 was done under license from the Quake 1 engine, so it's a heavily modified Q1 engine. Sometime when they were creating the game Q2 was released and they used some small code from that engine, so you can say it's a mix of Q1 and Q2 code, heavily modified.
<br /><br />The HL2 engine is the HL1 engine with a lot rewritten. Although fanboys like to say it's "100% new, rewrote from scratch" (maybe in an attempt to show valve is far superior to id and doesn't need any of the original licensed code) and valve employees have said that on interviews too, it's not. Yes, many of the engine functionality (ie, mods) is still bound to the id way, which is a good thing (I personally hate the way you have to deal with mods on the ut2kx engines, for example)... but more than that, there's a lot of code that still comes directly from the HL1 version. Nothing shocking, of course, since some code like directinput handling or file reading or whatever doesn't have to be changed between different engines anyways.
<br /><br />So you can say HL2 is a heavily modified engine based on an engine that is itself a heavily modified version of the Q1/Q2 engine.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p63667" date="Posted: Thu Nov 18, 2004 1:57 pm "><author>Docgalaad</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Afaik HL1 was based on the Q2 engine, Q2 were to be released soon and they shifted from Q1 to Q2 in the middle of the development.

After the renderer was functional and the other programmers came off of TA and Wolf, the rest of the codebase got rewritten.

<br /><br />HL2 on the other hand... Anyone who's seen the source code leak can testify that they basically took HL1, wrote a new file access backend and renderer, then bolted about $200,000,000 of proprietary SDKs on to it.  The gamecode even uses old HL1 callbacks and uses the old frame/edict based networking stuff.  The map format is an attrocious blend of HL1 BSP with displacement-mapped terrain and static meshes.  If you wondered why HL2's levels were so short, there's why.
<br /><br />Why do this?  Why do you think?  Not to shorten development, but rather so they could milk every last penny they could out of Half-Life and Counter-Strike.

<br /><br />Shame they are the industry leaders right now, then.  It's hypocritical of you to slag off Valve, yet simultaneously be totally behind games which are designed to tick a load of boxes which didn't even exist before HL.
<br /><br />As for graphics, as long as they are fairly competitive, so what, really?  HL2 looked great in places (IMO, hi-res lightmaps can still occasionally yield an edge over stencil shadows due to radiosity), Doom3 looked very good overall and Quake4 at it's best looked as good as Doom3 and OK otherwise.  My favourite game of the lot though? Q4.  You can bet it will have more impact than Doom3, but it's not down to the graphics.
<br /><br />I don't particularly like Valve's approach (if anything, I blame them for a lot), but  I appreciate that it exemplifies many of the defining trends in the modern FPS, which other games just imitate.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p126626" date="Posted: Thu Dec 22, 2005 10:14 pm "><author>Exitus</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">No, it is not.
<br />The source engine is 100% valve (except for the Havok physics, of course)

<br /><br />i don't really know why valve-fans always get uspet over this.  it has part of Quake 1 code in there from HL1.  The MDL format isn't that different from HL1's MDL format which hints (strongly) that they kept the model reading code at least.
<br /><br />i love id &amp; doom 3 &amp; don't have a problem saying three's a little bit of Q3A code in there. Heck, why re-write the console system 3 different times? <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225072113im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p126688" date="Posted: Fri Dec 23, 2005 11:40 am "><author>obihb</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Sorry, but this thread gets 5/5 for "most useless thread ever!".

It's a programming language and from my understanding it's basically C++ with extensions.
<br /><br />If performance is an issue, you can always code in assembly. That will yield more gain in performance than anything.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p134096" date="Posted: Wed Feb 22, 2006 12:11 am "><author>rtkwe</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Problem is that assembly is one of the most obscure programming languages other than basic machine code.</div>]]></body></post></posts></thread></xml>
