<br /><br />Yeah, I've puzzled over zspheres as well.  I think zspheres only work well when you string a few together.  When I say a few i mean be quite generous.  When I used too few zspheres I found my meshes became twisted and distorted.  I think using more spheres subdivides the mesh to a greater extent.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p135097" date="Posted: Wed Mar 01, 2006 3:05 pm "><author>snake85027</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I just have a big question, I dont really know what I did but everytime that i make a 3d sphere in zbrush 2 and then preview it HALF of the model is there, i just dont get it.
