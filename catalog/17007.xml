<br/><br/>
I work in Maya, have no other 3D app so have to use it for everything, including static meshes. Because Maya doesn't support output of these file types I have had to use the ActorX Unreal plugin to do it for me. Up until now it has worked just fine.&#13;
<br/><br/>
However I'm building the inside of a bus to open my level. Creating this as a single mesh would create a massive headache for UV layouts, so what I've opted to do is build Each section (seats, body, poles) seperately, with their own unique materials and UV layouts.&#13;
<br/><br/>
First of all I imported each of these assets into Doom 3 (sort of rebuilding the bus within Radiant) and got the following results:&#13;
<br/><br/><img src="/web/20061013060211im_/http://www.bloodspitstudios.com/Monster1.jpg" border="0"/><br/><br/>
Yes its ugly, but its working. I then figured it may be better to bring all these assets into one scene in Maya, and export them all (still with unique UV layouts) as a single mesh. So I did this, went into the new ASE file and pointed all the materials to the ones i'd created. However although it loads the model just fine (and does have a material applied to it) this is what I get:&#13;
<br/><br/><img src="/web/20061013060211im_/http://www.bloodspitstudios.com/Monster2.jpg" border="0"/><br/><br/>
Yes, a dam ugly pile of crap.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Anyone got any ideas how I could sort this?&#13;

The objects I am having trouble with are exported as a single file, but if you open them in maya they're all seperate.&#13;

I basically did the following:&#13;

Built Chair.mb file&#13;
<br/>
Built Body.mb file&#13;
<br/>
Built Pole.mb file&#13;
<br/><br/>
I then started a new scene, imported them all in, made sure they were good for exporting and exported the entire scene as a new ASE file. The assets were NOT combined into one piece of geometry. So although its one model in Doom, technically they're all seperate. I just don't friggin understand whats wrong with the textures!</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

I suspect that although you have each object separate in Maya, the exporter *is* combining them into one object, Blender USMExporter does the same thing because it was written with the same 'limitations' in mind.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="/web/20061013060211/http://www.doom3world.org/" target="_blank" class="postlink"><img src="/web/20061013060211im_/http://www.doom3world.org/site/img/d3w.gif" border="0"/>Co-Admin</a> - <a href="/web/20061013060211/http://www.quake3bits.com/" target="_blank" class="postlink">Modelling and modding tutorials and tips</a></span><span class="gensmall"/></td>
