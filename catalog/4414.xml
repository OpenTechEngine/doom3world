<br /><br />Any chance you could encode them in Windows Media - their encoder is free.  I cannot install your codec at work.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p39173" date="Posted: Fri Aug 20, 2004 10:02 pm "><author>MNeMiC</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Sorry, don't think I can, if someone else would like to re-encode them and host them that's fine, just post it here in the forums and give some credz to me.
<br /><br />I can't pick the Windows Media Codec when I encode cuz it aint there, and I don't wanna record with that program, since it's not too good with 3D. I use it for other VT's though, but not theese kind.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p39190" date="Posted: Fri Aug 20, 2004 10:51 pm "><author>c0bra</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I get this when trying to extract the movie and text file:
