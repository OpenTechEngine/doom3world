<br /><br />I basically want it so if I build a high poly model (or a few of them) which comprises of different materials with varying normal and diffuse maps, I can then bake that onto a low poly model, integrating the 3D info defined by its shape, the colour defined by the numerous diffuse maps and the normal maps of each material into one texture. Essentially so Maya can create a normal map which is a combination of the high poly model and the detailed bump maps derived from the individual materials.
<br /><br />Sorry if that's confusing, I'll reword if that helps in a bit of a rush at the moment. If anyone knows a way of doing this in maya or could advice on an alternate method (i also use ZBrush but havent experimented too much with it yet) it'd be greatly, greatly appreciated.
