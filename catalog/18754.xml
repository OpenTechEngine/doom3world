<br />For the heck of it decided to roll in with three ally bots as company, two machine gunners and a shottie gunner.  
<br />I wandered in a ways into the wood, enjoying the fantastic fog n lighting, the silhouettes of the crocked trees. I grew more tense the further I got in, looking back seeing the entrance get further away. Still nothing to fight.
<br />Then one of my guys called out 'enemy spotted' and it had started. 
<br />First I saw the glow of the maggots eyes, it ambled through the mist alternately running on two legs and dropping to fours.
<br />It only got to mid range before my guys cut it down, and a could of trees in the process. But I knew there would be more, many more.
<br />Taking stock from the start I knew I could count on my guys to save me some ammo, I just had to keep em alive. Rocket and bfg would be a mixed blessing, if I could catch the maggots at mid/long range it would be fine, but they could come from any side and close in and I'd just be hurting myself. Add to this the fact that I couldn't splash any of my guys, I couldn't use bfg at all with it's killbeams.
<br />Pretty soon things started ramping up, the combined fire from me and the bots mowing down huge swathes of the forest while maggots would kick up piles of it as they scrambled towards us.
<br />I burned through my chaingun ammo taking them down, then the plasma, and I started to get worried. My guys had taken a fair few scratches, there was a constant stream of maggots so I focused on using the db shottie to keep the maggots off them.
<br />Then I lost a guy, one of the machine gunners. I had to rethink. I switched to machinegun to hold his place and started picking off maggots at a distance again.
<br />They kept coming. Then withing a space of a couple of seconds I lost my remaining buddies. I ran out of machine gun bullets.
<br />I knew what despair was, I just realised I didn't know where I was.
<br />I surveyed my surroundings, a wood that seemingly stretched endlessly, swathes of cut down trees. Three human bodies. No exit. And through the fog, glowing eyes, bounding inhuman shapes.
<br /><br /><br />I enjoyed the map very much, played about half a dozen times, solo and with ally bots. 
<br />As I said the atmosphere from the lighting, mist, trees is awesome, the maggots are the absolutely perfect choice for the map in the way they look and move.
<br />The zone fading is pretty cool, and being able to lose the entrance is great, I'm tempted to use the flare grenades mod to mark my path back.
<br />Performance naturally started killing my computer once the trees started piling up.
<br />The scoreboard never worked for me, vanilla install or not.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p180424" date="Posted: Sun Jun 10, 2007 2:58 pm "><author>ColdT</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Many thanks for the exciting write up TinMan - I was on the edge of my seat reading it <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081120231452im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />Re the scoreboard - you have to click on it to get your score.
