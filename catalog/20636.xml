Unzip the zip file you downloaded, then place the "666.pk4" file in your base folder. (if you have any old 666 files installed, remember to remove them first.) Start Doom3 and type "CTRL + ALT + ~"  at the same time without the + marks. (to get the console) Once you have the console down, type in "map 6661" (without the quotes) and hit enter. That should make it start to load and run. Hope this helps.<br />Enjoy!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p189806" date="Posted: Tue Oct 09, 2007 3:56 am "><author>iwantmore</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: normal"><span style="color: #0000FF">UAC Franchise 666, Rebuild 2007</span></span></span><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081120192243im_/http://i17.photobucket.com/albums/b58/toolman66441/6661show.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">It is finally done!

I really enjoyed your map, and when I first played it I thought it was just going to be one level. I enjoyed every aspect of it, but did notice a few parts where some z-fighting went on.<br /><br />At the beginning, I remember seeing the soul cube and trying to pick it up, but it disappeared and all the zombies appeared in the conference room. At that point I completely forgot there was another soul cube above a desk. Because of that, when I got to the final level I couldn't kill the stupid Cyberdemon LOL. I had to cheat <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081120192243im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> to get the soul cube and then kill the Cyberdemon. Regardless of that, I really enjoyed your map. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081120192243im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />I hope to see more work from you, and possibly next time a more scary environment.

Unzip the zip file you downloaded, then place the "666.pk4" file in your base folder. (if you have any old 666 files installed, remember to remove them first.) Start Doom3 and type "CTRL + ALT + ~"  at the same time without the + marks. (to get the console) Once you have the console down, type in "map 6661" (without the quotes) and hit enter. That should make it start to load and run. Hope this helps.<br />Enjoy!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p198097" date="Posted: Sun Apr 27, 2008 11:52 am "><author>eVolution</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">To the original poster of this thread, thank you so much for a wonderful journey.

This is my first attempt at mapping of any kind. I've read most of the tutorials and learned a lot here. I still have a looooong way to go! I made this map for my own enjoyment and to see if I could learn how to do it. It started off as one big map, but my computer could not keep up so I had to break it down into about 4 levels. (My computer now: Core 2 Duo- 2.0, 2G ram, 100G-7400rpm hd, Geforce Go 7900 GS, 17 in LCD laptop)<br /><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">PLOT:</span><br /><br />The UAC has issued a warning of attacks from an unknown alien race to it's smaller franchise facilities on mars. It's your job marine to investigate and eliminate all threats to the UAC franchise #666. Good luck and God speed marine!<br /><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">BACKGROUND:</span><br /><br />This has been my first attempt at mapping for any game, much less creating a whole expansion pack. I'm learning as I go, and have had a blast learning all I can about the Doom 3 engine. I am a Doom fan from way back in the pentium 120 days. I would like to hear your ideas and opinions, rants and raves, about my expansion pack. All maps where created with the vanilla Doom3 editor. The PC I used to create this is a:<br />P-4, 2.6, with 512 ram, Gforce ti 4400 128 vid. card, 40 gig hd., 17 inch CRT monitor at 1024 X 768 res., win XP home.<br />Thanks to all the gods of the doom3world forum, for this would not be possible without them.<br /><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">STORYLINE:</span><br /><br />You are a highly decorated, combat tested marine, who just happens to have a problem with authority. (Hard to believe, I know...)<br /><br />Your last mission went badly because of the dumb-ass, green-horn, college-boy, desk-jocky lieutenant who was in charge of your last mission. Your whole squad was KIA during the mission, and you barely made it out alive.<br /><br />You vowed to get revenge on that snot nosed piece of crap lieutenant, just as soon as you returned to marine HQ. Some one had to pay for the death of your squad.<br /><br />Your punishment for punching out the lieutenant, after you returned to base, was a choice between the stockade, or volunteering for a mars mission that nobody has ever returned from.<br /><br />The UAC was conducting secret research on mars and the small franchise 666 facility was the end of the line for tired old dogs of war like you. You decided, "screw these bastards, I'll take as many of them out as I can. I'd rather go out fighting, get busy living or get busy dying and it's a good day to die!<br /><br />Your first day at the franchise 666 facility was full of filling out paperwork and getting through Main Processing. After a short look around the place you think "This may not be such a bad place for an old war dog like me after all..."<br /><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">SPECIAL CREDIT:</span><br /><br />Thanks to Voldemort for letting me use his exploding microwave (in my first map) and exploding fire extinguisher ideas.<br />Thanks to Zakyrus for his particle effect on the exploding fire extinguisher.<br />Thanks to all the rest of Doom3World.org Forum and the great bunch of folks who spent the time to help out.<br /><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">FEEDBACK:</span><br /><br />I'm looking for anything you care to comment on really. I've had a blast learning how to map for DOOM3. After seeing some of the great maps and mods posted here I almost did'ent post my map, but I figgured "hey, why not". I've been having my son be the beta tester until now, he's good at finding all my mistakes LOL. Enjoy, and every one keep up the good work!<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Tetzlaff wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I played it through now.
