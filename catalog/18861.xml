<br /><br />after posting about this tool in the pimping section <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203141311/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=18701" class="postlink">http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=18701</a> I now developed this tool to a point, at which it really got useful for Doom3 content creation. 
<br /><br />The example I show was derived from a simple armature, which can be setup in a few minutes, Skinny generated a rigged mesh from this armature and I then used the multires and sculpt tools to make high-res and low-res versions - again, a matter of a few minutes of modeling time. The newest version of Skinny supports semi-automated UV-mapping, by assigning the UV-space for each bone segment to a seamless tile on the overall UV-layout. How these tiles are arranged is simply set for each bone. 
<br /><br />I exported the meshes to ASE, used in-doom3 renderbump to make the normal map and took the screenshots shown below. The model is a static mesh, but as the blender mesh is fully rigged, I think that it will be very easy to get a rigged mesh running in Doom3 as well. I will test this till next weekend and add any final tweaks useful for streamlined doom3 content creation into the next release! 
<br /><br />There are a few things that could be improved in the future, for example, the UV seams are pretty prominent - probably due to overlap of some UV coordinates.
<br /><br />Total modeling time (including rigging, detailing and UV setup, but excluding computer calculation time for the normal map): about 10minutes...
