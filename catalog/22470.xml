No entries should be shown to the public before the contest closes - please, don't spoil it.<br /><br />2.) Filesize - since this is everyone's concern: no file size limit, but be aware no one is going to use it if it's too large<br /><br />3.) No "global domination weapons" - ie please don't create a weapon that gives an opponent in MP the upper hand regardless the skill. The use of the weapon must include either "aim" (well, point a virtual projectile on your pixelated enenmy) or "strategy" (as in proxy mines).<br /><br />4.) Set the damage, explosion radius, firing rate and stuff to reasonable (!) limits - no sense in creating a machine gun with 1 health point hits and a firing rate of 1000 projectiles per second - that will kill MP packet synchronisation and therefore leads to a failure in the "game ready" compliance<br /><br />5.) Game readiness - whatever you do, may it be just a set of custom textures to existing weapons and new projectiles to coding a whole new mod around your weapon - it must be the sort of drag, drop, use thing even noobs can handle. <br /><br />6.) File interference - do not create custom content which potentially interferes with other files. I strongly encourage you to simply prepend "d3wc2_" in front of all files to avoid conflicts and overwritten content. <br /><br />7.) Copyrights - don't use copyrighted material to create your weapon (of course you can use D3 stock content - that's not a violation) and be aware that all weapons must come with a declaration that you're fine if they, including the source code of any potential SDK modifications, get used in a third party mod or similar as long as you're properly credited. If you only want to show off your work but don't want others to use it, well, what are you doing here? I understand you don't want to give away the best asset of your mod, but in this case it shouldn't get exposed to public before your mod release anyways.<br /><br />8.) How to define a custom weapon: A weapon which may use D3 stock art / animation / functionality but is altered in a way which is not simply the reconfiguration of existing art / animation / functionality, but an all new "use experience" not present in D3 yet. Example: a shotgun shooting out of the box plasma balls is not a new weapon, but a shotgun with heatseeking minirockets and awsome bullet trails is. The more custom, the better.<br /><br />9.) Focus on entertainment - this is a custom weapon contest, not an "I am pervertedly cruel" contest. A cow launcher is certainly more entertaining than the Nth representation of splatterorama. But no - it does not have to be a kiss launcher which re-installs world wide love, peace and harmony. However - a weapon can also shoot health points rather than give them away, ever thought of an armor launcher useful for teamplay?<br /><br />10.) Team ready is a plus - I'm sure no one will be mad at you if you provide team ready content for multiplayer ( you know, the usual color coding red, blue...)<br /><br />11.) Common sense in terms of usability - do not create something which cannot get used afterwards. A weapon covering 90% of your vision is as usable as a box of matches in hell. Same holds true for for a 10000 health points kill weapon which clears the whole level (well, we could do a boss weapon contest some time later). Common sense is also a reasonable polycount - someting around 7,5k should do fine - there is no merit in downloading a super high res mesh somewhere and simply using it for this contest. Whatever you create - it should entertain and demonstrate your creativity, not your annoyance skills.<br /><br />12.) Stay clear of any insulting creations - this contest is not meant to transport religious, political, racial, sexual orientation... ideologies. Just - don't - do - it.<br /><br />13.) Target platform: Vanilla Doom3, latest patch. If your weapon comes in form of a mod, then make sure it's a drag and drop install, but don't forget to include your SDK modifications properly commented to allow others to build on it and learn.<br /><br />14.) Every entry must come with 4 good screenshots demonstrating your artwork and makes people want to download: A.) Close up as a model + custom ammo boxes (we'll provide a showroom for you to place your weapon and take shots from a fixed position to make it easier to compare). B.) A screenshot showing it on a player model C.) Showing the weapon in action, displaying bullet trails and stuff D.) Either a display of the new projectile or in case of a beam weapon of, well, the beam</span></span><br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000"><span style="font-weight: bold">Deadline: April 1st (don't worry about timezones). I will post a dedicated email address in the next days for you to submit your work as file or preferrably download location. After the contest all files will be made available here, along with an accompanying thread to showcase them all, voting and stuff.<br /><br />Please leave your comments at the end of this thread.</span></span><br /><br />Here it is upon popular demand - the next D3W contest.<br /><br />This is the pre-round, meaning people can determine the constest subject themselves via a quick poll.<br /><br />The target platform is <span style="text-decoration: underline">vanilla Doom3 1.3.1</span><br /><br />Here are the poll options:<br /><br />1.) Custom Weapon<br /><br />Contenders will be asked to step into the ring with an all new, custom weapon which must get distributed game ready and hassle free for any user obtaining it.<br />For those lacking modelling and / or animation skills and / or the available tools: An already present weapon model with animations can get used - we primarily and foremost want to see creativity, style, class, humor and ease of use, not a showcase how many grand you've spent for professional software.<br />However it is mandatory to supply: <br />- custom textures<br />- custom projectiles<br />- custom weapon effects<br />- custom weapon physics (mass and stuff)<br />- if possible custom sounds<br />- all new weapon models and animations will be a plus<br />- maximum filesize packed: 5mb<br /><br />2.) Enemy<br /><br />Creators of new enemies should start splitting the genome and come up with something that puts even outlandish Spore creation to shame. We want you to think what no one has thought before. A creature you don't want to face without your virtual gun greased up for action. <br />If you pull it off to present a monster which just makes us laugh so hard that we can't pull the trigger before getting forced to respawn, then all our base belongs to you.<br />For this contest we'll have to discriminate all users lacking modeling and animation skills / tools - unfortunately. A Hellknight with a large eye modeled on top of his skull wont cut it, Imps already have enough eyes too.<br />If you have your custom weapon already in the box and feel disappointed it turned into a monster constest - don't cry, just attached it to your new creation.<br />You are asked to supply: <br />- custom textures<br />- custom model with animations (if you have to use stock animations for what reason ever, we'll see how this could turn out)<br />- custom sounds are a plus<br />- ragdoll effects are a huge plus (ever thought on a deatch animation which removes the model and replaces it with a ragoll ?)<br />- it should be large enough to spot without a microscope and smaller than your average spaceship<br />- whatever you do, it must be game ready <br />- maximum file size packed 10mb<br /><br />3.) NPC<br /><br />For those of us being stressed out with life enough and wish for more Sims in Doom3 - here's your chance. The NPC must be interactive upon approach by the player (don't limit yourself to what he does then). All terms and conditions of custom enemies apply, just keep in mind NPCs are supposed not to attack you.<br /><br />4.) Static Model<br /><br />This is for the interior designer in you - time to stop hiding in the closet and get out to receive some spotlight! Let's finally hear the song of the unsung hero in level design, usually found only in the footnotes of the the prep's folder. And if you think this contest sounds far too metrosexual for you, then what the heck- build us a cool car! There are far too few Porsche 911 in Doom3 up until now! The world has more to offer than steel plates, crates, skulls, rocks and light fixtures. Always keep in mind - this contest is about creativity and not recreation of what we've seen countless times before, just in a new flashy color...<br />Here's what an aspiring star designer is supposed to achieve to spice up the living room of the still wealthy:<br />- custom model (obviously)<br />- custom texture (equally obviously)<br />- if it's something supposed to flip over if someone stumbles into, then apply the necessary physics<br />- custom sounds if necessary / desired<br />- custom material shader work<br />- if it's supposed to have an interactive interface, then, well, you know...<br />- it must be game ready<br />- it should be large enough to spot without a microscope and smaller than your average spaceship (unless it's a real cool spaceship of course)<br />- maximum file size packed 10mb<br /><br />That's it - for now..<br /><br />The vote will run from right now and expire March 2nd, midnight (no, I wont specify the timezone, so get your votes cast on March 1st to be sure). Every user can cast votes for two options, just in case you feel undecided.<br /><br />All contest entries must be finished and mailed / made available until April 1st 2009 - no joke.<br />We will set up a specific email address for this contest where everyone can send either the file to or the link to the download location. Please understand that we don't want to spend all day long hunting for contest entries. Also make sure not to send 50 times "an urgent update" - mistakes happen and we'll take that into account of course.<br /><br />Once the contest has decided upon we'll present you with the final guidelines and rules (expect some tight limits, but nothing that limits your creativity).<br /><br />So, good, fine, cool? <br /><br />Then go, tell your friends and family, pimp the contest around and don't forget to vote!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p211603" date="Posted: Mon Feb 23, 2009 8:34 pmÂ "><author>aardwolf</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I submit my vote for a nude XXX chicks of doom orgy addon !!!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319224323im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319224323im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p211604" date="Posted: Mon Feb 23, 2009 8:48 pmÂ "><author>afullo</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Weapons contest time!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319224323im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p211606" date="Posted: Mon Feb 23, 2009 9:34 pmÂ "><author>BloodRayne</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">- maximum filesize packed: 5mb</div><br />mmm... that might be a problem.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319224323im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p211607" date="Posted: Mon Feb 23, 2009 10:45 pmÂ "><author>=FF=Sturm</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">5 mbs  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319224323im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_question.gif" alt=":?:" title="Question" /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319224323im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319224323im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p211608" date="Posted: Mon Feb 23, 2009 11:09 pmÂ "><author>Pat AfterMoon</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">BNA! wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">- maximum filesize packed: 5mb</div>I also vote for more file size.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p211612" date="Posted: Tue Feb 24, 2009 12:07 amÂ "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Once the contest has decided upon we'll present you with the final guidelines and rules (expect some tight limits, but nothing that limits your creativity).</div><br /><br />Gentlemen, first please cast your vote then I'll be the last person not to set appropriate limits.<br />Don't hold this whole thing now hostage by riding a potential file size limit on a unicorn through hell...</div>]]></body></post><post id="p211613" date="Posted: Tue Feb 24, 2009 12:15 amÂ "><author>6th Venom</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">ok so if 5mb is not good we'll set it to 2,5mb!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319224323im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p211647" date="Posted: Tue Feb 24, 2009 3:49 amÂ "><author>The Happy Friar</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">no custom DLL for option 1, 2 or 3?  just checking for clarity.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p211657" date="Posted: Tue Feb 24, 2009 10:21 amÂ "><author>simulation</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">The Happy Friar wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">no custom DLL for option 1, 2 or 3?  just checking for clarity.</div><br />Why wouldn't custom gamecode be allowed?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p211658" date="Posted: Tue Feb 24, 2009 10:47 amÂ "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">

No entries should be shown to the public before the contest closes - please, don't spoil it.<br /><br />2.) Filesize - since this is everyone's concern: no file size limit, but be aware no one is going to use it if it's too large<br /><br />3.) No "global domination weapons" - ie please don't create a weapon that gives an opponent in MP the upper hand regardless the skill. The use of the weapon must include either "aim" (well, point a virtual projectile on your pixelated enenmy) or "strategy" (as in proxy mines).<br /><br />4.) Set the damage, explosion radius, firing rate and stuff to reasonable (!) limits - no sense in creating a machine gun with 1 health point hits and a firing rate of 1000 projectiles per second - that will kill MP packet synchronisation and therefore leads to a failure in the "game ready" compliance<br /><br />5.) Game readiness - whatever you do, may it be just a set of custom textures to existing weapons and new projectiles to coding a whole new mod around your weapon - it must be the sort of drag, drop, use thing even noobs can handle. <br /><br />6.) File interference - do not create custom content which potentially interferes with other files. I strongly encourage you to simply prepend "d3wc2_" in front of all files to avoid conflicts and overwritten content. <br /><br />7.) Copyrights - don't use copyrighted material to create your weapon (of course you can use D3 stock content - that's not a violation) and be aware that all weapons must come with a declaration that you're fine if they, including the source code of any potential SDK modifications, get used in a third party mod or similar as long as you're properly credited. If you only want to show off your work but don't want others to use it, well, what are you doing here? I understand you don't want to give away the best asset of your mod, but in this case it shouldn't get exposed to public before your mod release anyways.<br /><br />8.) How to define a custom weapon: A weapon which may use D3 stock art / animation / functionality but is altered in a way which is not simply the reconfiguration of existing art / animation / functionality, but an all new "use experience" not present in D3 yet. Example: a shotgun shooting out of the box plasma balls is not a new weapon, but a shotgun with heatseeking minirockets and awsome bullet trails is. The more custom, the better.<br /><br />9.) Focus on entertainment - this is a custom weapon contest, not an "I am pervertedly cruel" contest. A cow launcher is certainly more entertaining than the Nth representation of splatterorama. But no - it does not have to be a kiss launcher which re-installs world wide love, peace and harmony. However - a weapon can also shoot health points rather than give them away, ever thought of an armor launcher useful for teamplay?<br /><br />10.) Team ready is a plus - I'm sure no one will be mad at you if you provide team ready content for multiplayer ( you know, the usual color coding red, blue...)<br /><br />11.) Common sense in terms of usability - do not create something which cannot get used afterwards. A weapon covering 90% of your vision is as usable as a box of matches in hell. Same holds true for for a 10000 health points kill weapon which clears the whole level (well, we could do a boss weapon contest some time later). Common sense is also a reasonable polycount - someting around 7,5k should do fine - there is no merit in downloading a super high res mesh somewhere and simply using it for this contest. Whatever you create - it should entertain and demonstrate your creativity, not your annoyance skills.<br /><br />12.) Stay clear of any insulting creations - this contest is not meant to transport religious, political, racial, sexual orientation... ideologies. Just - don't - do - it.<br /><br />13.) Target platform: Vanilla Doom3, latest patch. If your weapon comes in form of a mod, then make sure it's a drag and drop install, but don't forget to include your SDK modifications properly commented to allow others to build on it and learn.<br /><br />14.) Every entry must come with 4 good screenshots demonstrating your artwork and makes people want to download: A.) Close up as a model + custom ammo boxes (we'll provide a showroom for you to place your weapon and take shots from a fixed position to make it easier to compare). B.) A screenshot showing it on a player model C.) Showing the weapon in action, displaying bullet trails and stuff D.) Either a display of the new projectile or in case of a beam weapon of, well, the beam</span></span><br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000"><span style="font-weight: bold">Deadline: April 1st (don't worry about timezones). I will post a dedicated email address in the next days for you to submit your work as file or preferrably download location. After the contest all files will be made available here, along with an accompanying thread to showcase them all, voting and stuff.<br /><br />Please leave your comments at the end of this thread.</span></span><br /><br />Here it is upon popular demand - the next D3W contest.<br /><br />This is the pre-round, meaning people can determine the constest subject themselves via a quick poll.<br /><br />The target platform is <span style="text-decoration: underline">vanilla Doom3 1.3.1</span><br /><br />Here are the poll options:<br /><br />1.) Custom Weapon<br /><br />Contenders will be asked to step into the ring with an all new, custom weapon which must get distributed game ready and hassle free for any user obtaining it.<br />For those lacking modelling and / or animation skills and / or the available tools: An already present weapon model with animations can get used - we primarily and foremost want to see creativity, style, class, humor and ease of use, not a showcase how many grand you've spent for professional software.<br />However it is mandatory to supply: <br />- custom textures<br />- custom projectiles<br />- custom weapon effects<br />- custom weapon physics (mass and stuff)<br />- if possible custom sounds<br />- all new weapon models and animations will be a plus<br />- maximum filesize packed: 5mb<br /><br />2.) Enemy<br /><br />Creators of new enemies should start splitting the genome and come up with something that puts even outlandish Spore creation to shame. We want you to think what no one has thought before. A creature you don't want to face without your virtual gun greased up for action. <br />If you pull it off to present a monster which just makes us laugh so hard that we can't pull the trigger before getting forced to respawn, then all our base belongs to you.<br />For this contest we'll have to discriminate all users lacking modeling and animation skills / tools - unfortunately. A Hellknight with a large eye modeled on top of his skull wont cut it, Imps already have enough eyes too.<br />If you have your custom weapon already in the box and feel disappointed it turned into a monster constest - don't cry, just attached it to your new creation.<br />You are asked to supply: <br />- custom textures<br />- custom model with animations (if you have to use stock animations for what reason ever, we'll see how this could turn out)<br />- custom sounds are a plus<br />- ragdoll effects are a huge plus (ever thought on a deatch animation which removes the model and replaces it with a ragoll ?)<br />- it should be large enough to spot without a microscope and smaller than your average spaceship<br />- whatever you do, it must be game ready <br />- maximum file size packed 10mb<br /><br />3.) NPC<br /><br />For those of us being stressed out with life enough and wish for more Sims in Doom3 - here's your chance. The NPC must be interactive upon approach by the player (don't limit yourself to what he does then). All terms and conditions of custom enemies apply, just keep in mind NPCs are supposed not to attack you.<br /><br />4.) Static Model<br /><br />This is for the interior designer in you - time to stop hiding in the closet and get out to receive some spotlight! Let's finally hear the song of the unsung hero in level design, usually found only in the footnotes of the the prep's folder. And if you think this contest sounds far too metrosexual for you, then what the heck- build us a cool car! There are far too few Porsche 911 in Doom3 up until now! The world has more to offer than steel plates, crates, skulls, rocks and light fixtures. Always keep in mind - this contest is about creativity and not recreation of what we've seen countless times before, just in a new flashy color...<br />Here's what an aspiring star designer is supposed to achieve to spice up the living room of the still wealthy:<br />- custom model (obviously)<br />- custom texture (equally obviously)<br />- if it's something supposed to flip over if someone stumbles into, then apply the necessary physics<br />- custom sounds if necessary / desired<br />- custom material shader work<br />- if it's supposed to have an interactive interface, then, well, you know...<br />- it must be game ready<br />- it should be large enough to spot without a microscope and smaller than your average spaceship (unless it's a real cool spaceship of course)<br />- maximum file size packed 10mb<br /><br />That's it - for now..<br /><br />The vote will run from right now and expire March 2nd, midnight (no, I wont specify the timezone, so get your votes cast on March 1st to be sure). Every user can cast votes for two options, just in case you feel undecided.<br /><br />All contest entries must be finished and mailed / made available until April 1st 2009 - no joke.<br />We will set up a specific email address for this contest where everyone can send either the file to or the link to the download location. Please understand that we don't want to spend all day long hunting for contest entries. Also make sure not to send 50 times "an urgent update" - mistakes happen and we'll take that into account of course.<br /><br />Once the contest has decided upon we'll present you with the final guidelines and rules (expect some tight limits, but nothing that limits your creativity).<br /><br />So, good, fine, cool? <br /><br />Then go, tell your friends and family, pimp the contest around and don't forget to vote!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p211603" date="Posted: Mon Feb 23, 2009 8:34 pmÂ "><author>aardwolf</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I submit my vote for a nude XXX chicks of doom orgy addon !!!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319224928im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319224928im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p211604" date="Posted: Mon Feb 23, 2009 8:48 pmÂ "><author>afullo</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Weapons contest time!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319224928im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p211606" date="Posted: Mon Feb 23, 2009 9:34 pmÂ "><author>BloodRayne</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">- maximum filesize packed: 5mb</div><br />mmm... that might be a problem.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319224928im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p211607" date="Posted: Mon Feb 23, 2009 10:45 pmÂ "><author>=FF=Sturm</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">5 mbs  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319224928im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_question.gif" alt=":?:" title="Question" /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319224928im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319224928im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p211608" date="Posted: Mon Feb 23, 2009 11:09 pmÂ "><author>Pat AfterMoon</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">BNA! wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">- maximum filesize packed: 5mb</div>I also vote for more file size.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p211612" date="Posted: Tue Feb 24, 2009 12:07 amÂ "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Once the contest has decided upon we'll present you with the final guidelines and rules (expect some tight limits, but nothing that limits your creativity).</div><br /><br />Gentlemen, first please cast your vote then I'll be the last person not to set appropriate limits.<br />Don't hold this whole thing now hostage by riding a potential file size limit on a unicorn through hell...</div>]]></body></post><post id="p211613" date="Posted: Tue Feb 24, 2009 12:15 amÂ "><author>6th Venom</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">ok so if 5mb is not good we'll set it to 2,5mb!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319224928im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p211647" date="Posted: Tue Feb 24, 2009 3:49 amÂ "><author>The Happy Friar</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">no custom DLL for option 1, 2 or 3?  just checking for clarity.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p211657" date="Posted: Tue Feb 24, 2009 10:21 amÂ "><author>simulation</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">The Happy Friar wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">no custom DLL for option 1, 2 or 3?  just checking for clarity.</div><br />Why wouldn't custom gamecode be allowed?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p211658" date="Posted: Tue Feb 24, 2009 10:47 amÂ "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">

Fists included to avoid a MP crash &amp; flashlight included.  Supports all default Doom 3 multiplayer modes.  Readme &amp; how to run instructions included.  Images forth coming as I need sleep now (it's 1am).  Basically MP only as it's not much fun against current AI.<br /><br />Each new weapon has a new world pickup model, new view model &amp; new player world model (what other players see &amp; you see in mirrors).<br /><br />Shouldn't get any crashes in MP games as they all seem to have been squashed during play testing (that's [BTF]Jehar @ tastyspleen).<br /><br />Still some bugs that don't happen in SP but do in MP that I need to creatively squash, most of them are listed in readme.txt, but none of them will actually kill the game.  A map or two based on the new gameplay will eventually be coming.<br /><br />All modeling (except the arms already in the view model), textures, animation are me.  Blender &amp; Edit pad light for 95% of the work (textures in blender), gimp used to make the heightmaps &amp; specular maps.  [BTF]Jehar of tastyspleen.com &amp; Pappy-R of Planetdoom.com both helped test.<br /><br />EDIT: supports all current Doom 3 MP maps.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p213271" date="Posted: Wed Apr 01, 2009 7:03 amÂ "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Here is the email addy for the contest:<br /><br /><!-- e --><a href="mailto:cc2@doom3world.org">cc2@doom3world.org</a><!-- e --></div>]]></body></post><post id="p213276" date="Posted: Wed Apr 01, 2009 5:02 pmÂ "><author>The Happy Friar</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319224036/http://www.moddb.com/mods/the-happy-friars-paint-ball-to-the-max">http://www.moddb.com/mods/the-happy-fri ... to-the-max</a><!-- m --><br /><br />moddb.com page for my mod.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p213282" date="Posted: Wed Apr 01, 2009 8:58 pmÂ "><author>6th Venom</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I officially announce i'll not submit anything related to the contest.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319224036im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /><br /><br />I have to struggle irl to found another job after some real hard times, so i didn't had the time, nore the will, to make something. <br />(except a very raw Warhammer marine's bolter low poly model)<br /><br />the good news is that i found a job monday.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319224036im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8)" title="Cool" /><br /><br />Another good news is that i'll show you all something i've working on for 3 days now, that every one will surelly love.<br />(i'm really really enthousiast about it)<br /><br />@THF: I'll test it asap in sp <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319224036im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />  and give you feedbacks, but it certainly looks like you worked a lot on this, so congratz!<br /><br />Congratulations to all of you submitters anyway!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p213284" date="Posted: Wed Apr 01, 2009 9:32 pmÂ "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">So far I have received two emails - I hope this is not the end of it...<br /><br />I'll be away on business travell including Friday, April 3rd, so please send your work till Saturday, April 4th.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p213291" date="Posted: Thu Apr 02, 2009 1:44 amÂ "><author>The Happy Friar</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">BNA! wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">So far I have received two emails - I hope this is not the end of it...</div><br /><br />I hope not either.  some D3 "heavy hitters" said they'd love to do a weapon contest.

No entries should be shown to the public before the contest closes - please, don't spoil it.<br /><br />2.) Filesize - since this is everyone's concern: no file size limit, but be aware no one is going to use it if it's too large<br /><br />3.) No "global domination weapons" - ie please don't create a weapon that gives an opponent in MP the upper hand regardless the skill. The use of the weapon must include either "aim" (well, point a virtual projectile on your pixelated enenmy) or "strategy" (as in proxy mines).<br /><br />4.) Set the damage, explosion radius, firing rate and stuff to reasonable (!) limits - no sense in creating a machine gun with 1 health point hits and a firing rate of 1000 projectiles per second - that will kill MP packet synchronisation and therefore leads to a failure in the "game ready" compliance<br /><br />5.) Game readiness - whatever you do, may it be just a set of custom textures to existing weapons and new projectiles to coding a whole new mod around your weapon - it must be the sort of drag, drop, use thing even noobs can handle. <br /><br />6.) File interference - do not create custom content which potentially interferes with other files. I strongly encourage you to simply prepend "d3wc2_" in front of all files to avoid conflicts and overwritten content. <br /><br />7.) Copyrights - don't use copyrighted material to create your weapon (of course you can use D3 stock content - that's not a violation) and be aware that all weapons must come with a declaration that you're fine if they, including the source code of any potential SDK modifications, get used in a third party mod or similar as long as you're properly credited. If you only want to show off your work but don't want others to use it, well, what are you doing here? I understand you don't want to give away the best asset of your mod, but in this case it shouldn't get exposed to public before your mod release anyways.<br /><br />8.) How to define a custom weapon: A weapon which may use D3 stock art / animation / functionality but is altered in a way which is not simply the reconfiguration of existing art / animation / functionality, but an all new "use experience" not present in D3 yet. Example: a shotgun shooting out of the box plasma balls is not a new weapon, but a shotgun with heatseeking minirockets and awsome bullet trails is. The more custom, the better.<br /><br />9.) Focus on entertainment - this is a custom weapon contest, not an "I am pervertedly cruel" contest. A cow launcher is certainly more entertaining than the Nth representation of splatterorama. But no - it does not have to be a kiss launcher which re-installs world wide love, peace and harmony. However - a weapon can also shoot health points rather than give them away, ever thought of an armor launcher useful for teamplay?<br /><br />10.) Team ready is a plus - I'm sure no one will be mad at you if you provide team ready content for multiplayer ( you know, the usual color coding red, blue...)<br /><br />11.) Common sense in terms of usability - do not create something which cannot get used afterwards. A weapon covering 90% of your vision is as usable as a box of matches in hell. Same holds true for for a 10000 health points kill weapon which clears the whole level (well, we could do a boss weapon contest some time later). Common sense is also a reasonable polycount - someting around 7,5k should do fine - there is no merit in downloading a super high res mesh somewhere and simply using it for this contest. Whatever you create - it should entertain and demonstrate your creativity, not your annoyance skills.<br /><br />12.) Stay clear of any insulting creations - this contest is not meant to transport religious, political, racial, sexual orientation... ideologies. Just - don't - do - it.<br /><br />13.) Target platform: Vanilla Doom3, latest patch. If your weapon comes in form of a mod, then make sure it's a drag and drop install, but don't forget to include your SDK modifications properly commented to allow others to build on it and learn.<br /><br />14.) Every entry must come with 4 good screenshots demonstrating your artwork and makes people want to download: A.) Close up as a model + custom ammo boxes (we'll provide a showroom for you to place your weapon and take shots from a fixed position to make it easier to compare). B.) A screenshot showing it on a player model C.) Showing the weapon in action, displaying bullet trails and stuff D.) Either a display of the new projectile or in case of a beam weapon of, well, the beam</span></span><br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000"><span style="font-weight: bold">Deadline: April 1st (don't worry about timezones). I will post a dedicated email address in the next days for you to submit your work as file or preferrably download location. After the contest all files will be made available here, along with an accompanying thread to showcase them all, voting and stuff.<br /><br />Please leave your comments at the end of this thread.</span></span><br /><br />Here it is upon popular demand - the next D3W contest.<br /><br />This is the pre-round, meaning people can determine the constest subject themselves via a quick poll.<br /><br />The target platform is <span style="text-decoration: underline">vanilla Doom3 1.3.1</span><br /><br />Here are the poll options:<br /><br />1.) Custom Weapon<br /><br />Contenders will be asked to step into the ring with an all new, custom weapon which must get distributed game ready and hassle free for any user obtaining it.<br />For those lacking modelling and / or animation skills and / or the available tools: An already present weapon model with animations can get used - we primarily and foremost want to see creativity, style, class, humor and ease of use, not a showcase how many grand you've spent for professional software.<br />However it is mandatory to supply: <br />- custom textures<br />- custom projectiles<br />- custom weapon effects<br />- custom weapon physics (mass and stuff)<br />- if possible custom sounds<br />- all new weapon models and animations will be a plus<br />- maximum filesize packed: 5mb<br /><br />2.) Enemy<br /><br />Creators of new enemies should start splitting the genome and come up with something that puts even outlandish Spore creation to shame. We want you to think what no one has thought before. A creature you don't want to face without your virtual gun greased up for action. <br />If you pull it off to present a monster which just makes us laugh so hard that we can't pull the trigger before getting forced to respawn, then all our base belongs to you.<br />For this contest we'll have to discriminate all users lacking modeling and animation skills / tools - unfortunately. A Hellknight with a large eye modeled on top of his skull wont cut it, Imps already have enough eyes too.<br />If you have your custom weapon already in the box and feel disappointed it turned into a monster constest - don't cry, just attached it to your new creation.<br />You are asked to supply: <br />- custom textures<br />- custom model with animations (if you have to use stock animations for what reason ever, we'll see how this could turn out)<br />- custom sounds are a plus<br />- ragdoll effects are a huge plus (ever thought on a deatch animation which removes the model and replaces it with a ragoll ?)<br />- it should be large enough to spot without a microscope and smaller than your average spaceship<br />- whatever you do, it must be game ready <br />- maximum file size packed 10mb<br /><br />3.) NPC<br /><br />For those of us being stressed out with life enough and wish for more Sims in Doom3 - here's your chance. The NPC must be interactive upon approach by the player (don't limit yourself to what he does then). All terms and conditions of custom enemies apply, just keep in mind NPCs are supposed not to attack you.<br /><br />4.) Static Model<br /><br />This is for the interior designer in you - time to stop hiding in the closet and get out to receive some spotlight! Let's finally hear the song of the unsung hero in level design, usually found only in the footnotes of the the prep's folder. And if you think this contest sounds far too metrosexual for you, then what the heck- build us a cool car! There are far too few Porsche 911 in Doom3 up until now! The world has more to offer than steel plates, crates, skulls, rocks and light fixtures. Always keep in mind - this contest is about creativity and not recreation of what we've seen countless times before, just in a new flashy color...<br />Here's what an aspiring star designer is supposed to achieve to spice up the living room of the still wealthy:<br />- custom model (obviously)<br />- custom texture (equally obviously)<br />- if it's something supposed to flip over if someone stumbles into, then apply the necessary physics<br />- custom sounds if necessary / desired<br />- custom material shader work<br />- if it's supposed to have an interactive interface, then, well, you know...<br />- it must be game ready<br />- it should be large enough to spot without a microscope and smaller than your average spaceship (unless it's a real cool spaceship of course)<br />- maximum file size packed 10mb<br /><br />That's it - for now..<br /><br />The vote will run from right now and expire March 2nd, midnight (no, I wont specify the timezone, so get your votes cast on March 1st to be sure). Every user can cast votes for two options, just in case you feel undecided.<br /><br />All contest entries must be finished and mailed / made available until April 1st 2009 - no joke.<br />We will set up a specific email address for this contest where everyone can send either the file to or the link to the download location. Please understand that we don't want to spend all day long hunting for contest entries. Also make sure not to send 50 times "an urgent update" - mistakes happen and we'll take that into account of course.<br /><br />Once the contest has decided upon we'll present you with the final guidelines and rules (expect some tight limits, but nothing that limits your creativity).<br /><br />So, good, fine, cool? <br /><br />Then go, tell your friends and family, pimp the contest around and don't forget to vote!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p211603" date="Posted: Mon Feb 23, 2009 8:34 pmÂ "><author>aardwolf</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I submit my vote for a nude XXX chicks of doom orgy addon !!!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224213137im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224213137im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p211604" date="Posted: Mon Feb 23, 2009 8:48 pmÂ "><author>afullo</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Weapons contest time!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224213137im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p211606" date="Posted: Mon Feb 23, 2009 9:34 pmÂ "><author>BloodRayne</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">- maximum filesize packed: 5mb</div><br />mmm... that might be a problem.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224213137im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p211607" date="Posted: Mon Feb 23, 2009 10:45 pmÂ "><author>=FF=Sturm</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">5 mbs  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224213137im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_question.gif" alt=":?:" title="Question" /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224213137im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224213137im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p211608" date="Posted: Mon Feb 23, 2009 11:09 pmÂ "><author>Pat AfterMoon</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">BNA! wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">- maximum filesize packed: 5mb</div>I also vote for more file size.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p211612" date="Posted: Tue Feb 24, 2009 12:07 amÂ "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Once the contest has decided upon we'll present you with the final guidelines and rules (expect some tight limits, but nothing that limits your creativity).</div><br /><br />Gentlemen, first please cast your vote then I'll be the last person not to set appropriate limits.<br />Don't hold this whole thing now hostage by riding a potential file size limit on a unicorn through hell...</div>]]></body></post><post id="p211613" date="Posted: Tue Feb 24, 2009 12:15 amÂ "><author>6th Venom</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">ok so if 5mb is not good we'll set it to 2,5mb!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224213137im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p211647" date="Posted: Tue Feb 24, 2009 3:49 amÂ "><author>The Happy Friar</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">no custom DLL for option 1, 2 or 3?  just checking for clarity.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p211657" date="Posted: Tue Feb 24, 2009 10:21 amÂ "><author>simulation</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">The Happy Friar wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">no custom DLL for option 1, 2 or 3?  just checking for clarity.</div><br />Why wouldn't custom gamecode be allowed?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p211658" date="Posted: Tue Feb 24, 2009 10:47 amÂ "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">

Fists included to avoid a MP crash &amp; flashlight included.  Supports all default Doom 3 multiplayer modes.  Readme &amp; how to run instructions included.  Images forth coming as I need sleep now (it's 1am).  Basically MP only as it's not much fun against current AI.<br /><br />Each new weapon has a new world pickup model, new view model &amp; new player world model (what other players see &amp; you see in mirrors).<br /><br />Shouldn't get any crashes in MP games as they all seem to have been squashed during play testing (that's [BTF]Jehar @ tastyspleen).<br /><br />Still some bugs that don't happen in SP but do in MP that I need to creatively squash, most of them are listed in readme.txt, but none of them will actually kill the game.  A map or two based on the new gameplay will eventually be coming.<br /><br />All modeling (except the arms already in the view model), textures, animation are me.

No entries should be shown to the public before the contest closes - please, don't spoil it.<br /><br />2.) Filesize - since this is everyone's concern: no file size limit, but be aware no one is going to use it if it's too large<br /><br />3.) No "global domination weapons" - ie please don't create a weapon that gives an opponent in MP the upper hand regardless the skill. The use of the weapon must include either "aim" (well, point a virtual projectile on your pixelated enenmy) or "strategy" (as in proxy mines).<br /><br />4.) Set the damage, explosion radius, firing rate and stuff to reasonable (!) limits - no sense in creating a machine gun with 1 health point hits and a firing rate of 1000 projectiles per second - that will kill MP packet synchronisation and therefore leads to a failure in the "game ready" compliance<br /><br />5.) Game readiness - whatever you do, may it be just a set of custom textures to existing weapons and new projectiles to coding a whole new mod around your weapon - it must be the sort of drag, drop, use thing even noobs can handle. <br /><br />6.) File interference - do not create custom content which potentially interferes with other files. I strongly encourage you to simply prepend "d3wc2_" in front of all files to avoid conflicts and overwritten content. <br /><br />7.) Copyrights - don't use copyrighted material to create your weapon (of course you can use D3 stock content - that's not a violation) and be aware that all weapons must come with a declaration that you're fine if they, including the source code of any potential SDK modifications, get used in a third party mod or similar as long as you're properly credited. If you only want to show off your work but don't want others to use it, well, what are you doing here? I understand you don't want to give away the best asset of your mod, but in this case it shouldn't get exposed to public before your mod release anyways.<br /><br />8.) How to define a custom weapon: A weapon which may use D3 stock art / animation / functionality but is altered in a way which is not simply the reconfiguration of existing art / animation / functionality, but an all new "use experience" not present in D3 yet. Example: a shotgun shooting out of the box plasma balls is not a new weapon, but a shotgun with heatseeking minirockets and awsome bullet trails is. The more custom, the better.<br /><br />9.) Focus on entertainment - this is a custom weapon contest, not an "I am pervertedly cruel" contest. A cow launcher is certainly more entertaining than the Nth representation of splatterorama. But no - it does not have to be a kiss launcher which re-installs world wide love, peace and harmony. However - a weapon can also shoot health points rather than give them away, ever thought of an armor launcher useful for teamplay?<br /><br />10.) Team ready is a plus - I'm sure no one will be mad at you if you provide team ready content for multiplayer ( you know, the usual color coding red, blue...)<br /><br />11.) Common sense in terms of usability - do not create something which cannot get used afterwards. A weapon covering 90% of your vision is as usable as a box of matches in hell. Same holds true for for a 10000 health points kill weapon which clears the whole level (well, we could do a boss weapon contest some time later). Common sense is also a reasonable polycount - someting around 7,5k should do fine - there is no merit in downloading a super high res mesh somewhere and simply using it for this contest. Whatever you create - it should entertain and demonstrate your creativity, not your annoyance skills.<br /><br />12.) Stay clear of any insulting creations - this contest is not meant to transport religious, political, racial, sexual orientation... ideologies. Just - don't - do - it.<br /><br />13.) Target platform: Vanilla Doom3, latest patch. If your weapon comes in form of a mod, then make sure it's a drag and drop install, but don't forget to include your SDK modifications properly commented to allow others to build on it and learn.<br /><br />14.) Every entry must come with 4 good screenshots demonstrating your artwork and makes people want to download: A.) Close up as a model + custom ammo boxes (we'll provide a showroom for you to place your weapon and take shots from a fixed position to make it easier to compare). B.) A screenshot showing it on a player model C.) Showing the weapon in action, displaying bullet trails and stuff D.) Either a display of the new projectile or in case of a beam weapon of, well, the beam</span></span><br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000"><span style="font-weight: bold">Deadline: April 1st (don't worry about timezones). I will post a dedicated email address in the next days for you to submit your work as file or preferrably download location. After the contest all files will be made available here, along with an accompanying thread to showcase them all, voting and stuff.<br /><br />Please leave your comments at the end of this thread.</span></span><br /><br />Here it is upon popular demand - the next D3W contest.<br /><br />This is the pre-round, meaning people can determine the constest subject themselves via a quick poll.<br /><br />The target platform is <span style="text-decoration: underline">vanilla Doom3 1.3.1</span><br /><br />Here are the poll options:<br /><br />1.) Custom Weapon<br /><br />Contenders will be asked to step into the ring with an all new, custom weapon which must get distributed game ready and hassle free for any user obtaining it.<br />For those lacking modelling and / or animation skills and / or the available tools: An already present weapon model with animations can get used - we primarily and foremost want to see creativity, style, class, humor and ease of use, not a showcase how many grand you've spent for professional software.<br />However it is mandatory to supply: <br />- custom textures<br />- custom projectiles<br />- custom weapon effects<br />- custom weapon physics (mass and stuff)<br />- if possible custom sounds<br />- all new weapon models and animations will be a plus<br />- maximum filesize packed: 5mb<br /><br />2.) Enemy<br /><br />Creators of new enemies should start splitting the genome and come up with something that puts even outlandish Spore creation to shame. We want you to think what no one has thought before. A creature you don't want to face without your virtual gun greased up for action. <br />If you pull it off to present a monster which just makes us laugh so hard that we can't pull the trigger before getting forced to respawn, then all our base belongs to you.<br />For this contest we'll have to discriminate all users lacking modeling and animation skills / tools - unfortunately. A Hellknight with a large eye modeled on top of his skull wont cut it, Imps already have enough eyes too.<br />If you have your custom weapon already in the box and feel disappointed it turned into a monster constest - don't cry, just attached it to your new creation.<br />You are asked to supply: <br />- custom textures<br />- custom model with animations (if you have to use stock animations for what reason ever, we'll see how this could turn out)<br />- custom sounds are a plus<br />- ragdoll effects are a huge plus (ever thought on a deatch animation which removes the model and replaces it with a ragoll ?)<br />- it should be large enough to spot without a microscope and smaller than your average spaceship<br />- whatever you do, it must be game ready <br />- maximum file size packed 10mb<br /><br />3.) NPC<br /><br />For those of us being stressed out with life enough and wish for more Sims in Doom3 - here's your chance. The NPC must be interactive upon approach by the player (don't limit yourself to what he does then). All terms and conditions of custom enemies apply, just keep in mind NPCs are supposed not to attack you.<br /><br />4.) Static Model<br /><br />This is for the interior designer in you - time to stop hiding in the closet and get out to receive some spotlight! Let's finally hear the song of the unsung hero in level design, usually found only in the footnotes of the the prep's folder. And if you think this contest sounds far too metrosexual for you, then what the heck- build us a cool car! There are far too few Porsche 911 in Doom3 up until now! The world has more to offer than steel plates, crates, skulls, rocks and light fixtures. Always keep in mind - this contest is about creativity and not recreation of what we've seen countless times before, just in a new flashy color...<br />Here's what an aspiring star designer is supposed to achieve to spice up the living room of the still wealthy:<br />- custom model (obviously)<br />- custom texture (equally obviously)<br />- if it's something supposed to flip over if someone stumbles into, then apply the necessary physics<br />- custom sounds if necessary / desired<br />- custom material shader work<br />- if it's supposed to have an interactive interface, then, well, you know...<br />- it must be game ready<br />- it should be large enough to spot without a microscope and smaller than your average spaceship (unless it's a real cool spaceship of course)<br />- maximum file size packed 10mb<br /><br />That's it - for now..<br /><br />The vote will run from right now and expire March 2nd, midnight (no, I wont specify the timezone, so get your votes cast on March 1st to be sure). Every user can cast votes for two options, just in case you feel undecided.<br /><br />All contest entries must be finished and mailed / made available until April 1st 2009 - no joke.<br />We will set up a specific email address for this contest where everyone can send either the file to or the link to the download location. Please understand that we don't want to spend all day long hunting for contest entries. Also make sure not to send 50 times "an urgent update" - mistakes happen and we'll take that into account of course.<br /><br />Once the contest has decided upon we'll present you with the final guidelines and rules (expect some tight limits, but nothing that limits your creativity).<br /><br />So, good, fine, cool? <br /><br />Then go, tell your friends and family, pimp the contest around and don't forget to vote!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p211603" date="Posted: Mon Feb 23, 2009 8:34 pmÂ "><author>aardwolf</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I submit my vote for a nude XXX chicks of doom orgy addon !!!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319224928im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319224928im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p211604" date="Posted: Mon Feb 23, 2009 8:48 pmÂ "><author>afullo</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Weapons contest time!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319224928im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p211606" date="Posted: Mon Feb 23, 2009 9:34 pmÂ "><author>BloodRayne</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">- maximum filesize packed: 5mb</div><br />mmm... that might be a problem.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319224928im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p211607" date="Posted: Mon Feb 23, 2009 10:45 pmÂ "><author>=FF=Sturm</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">5 mbs  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319224928im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_question.gif" alt=":?:" title="Question" /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319224928im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319224928im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p211608" date="Posted: Mon Feb 23, 2009 11:09 pmÂ "><author>Pat AfterMoon</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">BNA! wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">- maximum filesize packed: 5mb</div>I also vote for more file size.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p211612" date="Posted: Tue Feb 24, 2009 12:07 amÂ "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Once the contest has decided upon we'll present you with the final guidelines and rules (expect some tight limits, but nothing that limits your creativity).</div><br /><br />Gentlemen, first please cast your vote then I'll be the last person not to set appropriate limits.<br />Don't hold this whole thing now hostage by riding a potential file size limit on a unicorn through hell...</div>]]></body></post><post id="p211613" date="Posted: Tue Feb 24, 2009 12:15 amÂ "><author>6th Venom</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">ok so if 5mb is not good we'll set it to 2,5mb!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319224928im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p211647" date="Posted: Tue Feb 24, 2009 3:49 amÂ "><author>The Happy Friar</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">no custom DLL for option 1, 2 or 3?  just checking for clarity.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p211657" date="Posted: Tue Feb 24, 2009 10:21 amÂ "><author>simulation</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">The Happy Friar wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">no custom DLL for option 1, 2 or 3?  just checking for clarity.</div><br />Why wouldn't custom gamecode be allowed?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p211658" date="Posted: Tue Feb 24, 2009 10:47 amÂ "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">

Fists included to avoid a MP crash &amp; flashlight included.  Supports all default Doom 3 multiplayer modes.  Readme &amp; how to run instructions included.  Images forth coming as I need sleep now (it's 1am).  Basically MP only as it's not much fun against current AI.<br /><br />Each new weapon has a new world pickup model, new view model &amp; new player world model (what other players see &amp; you see in mirrors).<br /><br />Shouldn't get any crashes in MP games as they all seem to have been squashed during play testing (that's [BTF]Jehar @ tastyspleen).<br /><br />Still some bugs that don't happen in SP but do in MP that I need to creatively squash, most of them are listed in readme.txt, but none of them will actually kill the game.

No entries should be shown to the public before the contest closes - please, don't spoil it.<br /><br />2.) Filesize - since this is everyone's concern: no file size limit, but be aware no one is going to use it if it's too large<br /><br />3.) No "global domination weapons" - ie please don't create a weapon that gives an opponent in MP the upper hand regardless the skill. The use of the weapon must include either "aim" (well, point a virtual projectile on your pixelated enenmy) or "strategy" (as in proxy mines).<br /><br />4.) Set the damage, explosion radius, firing rate and stuff to reasonable (!) limits - no sense in creating a machine gun with 1 health point hits and a firing rate of 1000 projectiles per second - that will kill MP packet synchronisation and therefore leads to a failure in the "game ready" compliance<br /><br />5.) Game readiness - whatever you do, may it be just a set of custom textures to existing weapons and new projectiles to coding a whole new mod around your weapon - it must be the sort of drag, drop, use thing even noobs can handle. <br /><br />6.) File interference - do not create custom content which potentially interferes with other files. I strongly encourage you to simply prepend "d3wc2_" in front of all files to avoid conflicts and overwritten content. <br /><br />7.) Copyrights - don't use copyrighted material to create your weapon (of course you can use D3 stock content - that's not a violation) and be aware that all weapons must come with a declaration that you're fine if they, including the source code of any potential SDK modifications, get used in a third party mod or similar as long as you're properly credited. If you only want to show off your work but don't want others to use it, well, what are you doing here? I understand you don't want to give away the best asset of your mod, but in this case it shouldn't get exposed to public before your mod release anyways.<br /><br />8.) How to define a custom weapon: A weapon which may use D3 stock art / animation / functionality but is altered in a way which is not simply the reconfiguration of existing art / animation / functionality, but an all new "use experience" not present in D3 yet. Example: a shotgun shooting out of the box plasma balls is not a new weapon, but a shotgun with heatseeking minirockets and awsome bullet trails is. The more custom, the better.<br /><br />9.) Focus on entertainment - this is a custom weapon contest, not an "I am pervertedly cruel" contest. A cow launcher is certainly more entertaining than the Nth representation of splatterorama. But no - it does not have to be a kiss launcher which re-installs world wide love, peace and harmony. However - a weapon can also shoot health points rather than give them away, ever thought of an armor launcher useful for teamplay?<br /><br />10.) Team ready is a plus - I'm sure no one will be mad at you if you provide team ready content for multiplayer ( you know, the usual color coding red, blue...)<br /><br />11.) Common sense in terms of usability - do not create something which cannot get used afterwards. A weapon covering 90% of your vision is as usable as a box of matches in hell. Same holds true for for a 10000 health points kill weapon which clears the whole level (well, we could do a boss weapon contest some time later). Common sense is also a reasonable polycount - someting around 7,5k should do fine - there is no merit in downloading a super high res mesh somewhere and simply using it for this contest. Whatever you create - it should entertain and demonstrate your creativity, not your annoyance skills.<br /><br />12.) Stay clear of any insulting creations - this contest is not meant to transport religious, political, racial, sexual orientation... ideologies. Just - don't - do - it.<br /><br />13.) Target platform: Vanilla Doom3, latest patch. If your weapon comes in form of a mod, then make sure it's a drag and drop install, but don't forget to include your SDK modifications properly commented to allow others to build on it and learn.<br /><br />14.) Every entry must come with 4 good screenshots demonstrating your artwork and makes people want to download: A.) Close up as a model + custom ammo boxes (we'll provide a showroom for you to place your weapon and take shots from a fixed position to make it easier to compare). B.) A screenshot showing it on a player model C.) Showing the weapon in action, displaying bullet trails and stuff D.) Either a display of the new projectile or in case of a beam weapon of, well, the beam</span></span><br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000"><span style="font-weight: bold">Deadline: April 1st (don't worry about timezones). I will post a dedicated email address in the next days for you to submit your work as file or preferrably download location. After the contest all files will be made available here, along with an accompanying thread to showcase them all, voting and stuff.<br /><br />Please leave your comments at the end of this thread.</span></span><br /><br />Here it is upon popular demand - the next D3W contest.<br /><br />This is the pre-round, meaning people can determine the constest subject themselves via a quick poll.<br /><br />The target platform is <span style="text-decoration: underline">vanilla Doom3 1.3.1</span><br /><br />Here are the poll options:<br /><br />1.) Custom Weapon<br /><br />Contenders will be asked to step into the ring with an all new, custom weapon which must get distributed game ready and hassle free for any user obtaining it.<br />For those lacking modelling and / or animation skills and / or the available tools: An already present weapon model with animations can get used - we primarily and foremost want to see creativity, style, class, humor and ease of use, not a showcase how many grand you've spent for professional software.<br />However it is mandatory to supply: <br />- custom textures<br />- custom projectiles<br />- custom weapon effects<br />- custom weapon physics (mass and stuff)<br />- if possible custom sounds<br />- all new weapon models and animations will be a plus<br />- maximum filesize packed: 5mb<br /><br />2.) Enemy<br /><br />Creators of new enemies should start splitting the genome and come up with something that puts even outlandish Spore creation to shame. We want you to think what no one has thought before. A creature you don't want to face without your virtual gun greased up for action. <br />If you pull it off to present a monster which just makes us laugh so hard that we can't pull the trigger before getting forced to respawn, then all our base belongs to you.<br />For this contest we'll have to discriminate all users lacking modeling and animation skills / tools - unfortunately. A Hellknight with a large eye modeled on top of his skull wont cut it, Imps already have enough eyes too.<br />If you have your custom weapon already in the box and feel disappointed it turned into a monster constest - don't cry, just attached it to your new creation.<br />You are asked to supply: <br />- custom textures<br />- custom model with animations (if you have to use stock animations for what reason ever, we'll see how this could turn out)<br />- custom sounds are a plus<br />- ragdoll effects are a huge plus (ever thought on a deatch animation which removes the model and replaces it with a ragoll ?)<br />- it should be large enough to spot without a microscope and smaller than your average spaceship<br />- whatever you do, it must be game ready <br />- maximum file size packed 10mb<br /><br />3.) NPC<br /><br />For those of us being stressed out with life enough and wish for more Sims in Doom3 - here's your chance. The NPC must be interactive upon approach by the player (don't limit yourself to what he does then). All terms and conditions of custom enemies apply, just keep in mind NPCs are supposed not to attack you.<br /><br />4.) Static Model<br /><br />This is for the interior designer in you - time to stop hiding in the closet and get out to receive some spotlight! Let's finally hear the song of the unsung hero in level design, usually found only in the footnotes of the the prep's folder. And if you think this contest sounds far too metrosexual for you, then what the heck- build us a cool car! There are far too few Porsche 911 in Doom3 up until now! The world has more to offer than steel plates, crates, skulls, rocks and light fixtures. Always keep in mind - this contest is about creativity and not recreation of what we've seen countless times before, just in a new flashy color...<br />Here's what an aspiring star designer is supposed to achieve to spice up the living room of the still wealthy:<br />- custom model (obviously)<br />- custom texture (equally obviously)<br />- if it's something supposed to flip over if someone stumbles into, then apply the necessary physics<br />- custom sounds if necessary / desired<br />- custom material shader work<br />- if it's supposed to have an interactive interface, then, well, you know...<br />- it must be game ready<br />- it should be large enough to spot without a microscope and smaller than your average spaceship (unless it's a real cool spaceship of course)<br />- maximum file size packed 10mb<br /><br />That's it - for now..<br /><br />The vote will run from right now and expire March 2nd, midnight (no, I wont specify the timezone, so get your votes cast on March 1st to be sure). Every user can cast votes for two options, just in case you feel undecided.<br /><br />All contest entries must be finished and mailed / made available until April 1st 2009 - no joke.<br />We will set up a specific email address for this contest where everyone can send either the file to or the link to the download location. Please understand that we don't want to spend all day long hunting for contest entries. Also make sure not to send 50 times "an urgent update" - mistakes happen and we'll take that into account of course.<br /><br />Once the contest has decided upon we'll present you with the final guidelines and rules (expect some tight limits, but nothing that limits your creativity).<br /><br />So, good, fine, cool? <br /><br />Then go, tell your friends and family, pimp the contest around and don't forget to vote!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p211603" date="Posted: Mon Feb 23, 2009 8:34 pmÂ "><author>aardwolf</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I submit my vote for a nude XXX chicks of doom orgy addon !!!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225024635im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225024635im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p211604" date="Posted: Mon Feb 23, 2009 8:48 pmÂ "><author>afullo</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Weapons contest time!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225024635im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p211606" date="Posted: Mon Feb 23, 2009 9:34 pmÂ "><author>BloodRayne</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">- maximum filesize packed: 5mb</div><br />mmm... that might be a problem.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225024635im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p211607" date="Posted: Mon Feb 23, 2009 10:45 pmÂ "><author>=FF=Sturm</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">5 mbs  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225024635im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_question.gif" alt=":?:" title="Question" /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225024635im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225024635im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p211608" date="Posted: Mon Feb 23, 2009 11:09 pmÂ "><author>Pat AfterMoon</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">BNA! wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">- maximum filesize packed: 5mb</div>I also vote for more file size.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p211612" date="Posted: Tue Feb 24, 2009 12:07 amÂ "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Once the contest has decided upon we'll present you with the final guidelines and rules (expect some tight limits, but nothing that limits your creativity).</div><br /><br />Gentlemen, first please cast your vote then I'll be the last person not to set appropriate limits.<br />Don't hold this whole thing now hostage by riding a potential file size limit on a unicorn through hell...</div>]]></body></post><post id="p211613" date="Posted: Tue Feb 24, 2009 12:15 amÂ "><author>6th Venom</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">ok so if 5mb is not good we'll set it to 2,5mb!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225024635im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p211647" date="Posted: Tue Feb 24, 2009 3:49 amÂ "><author>The Happy Friar</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">no custom DLL for option 1, 2 or 3?  just checking for clarity.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p211657" date="Posted: Tue Feb 24, 2009 10:21 amÂ "><author>simulation</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">The Happy Friar wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">no custom DLL for option 1, 2 or 3?  just checking for clarity.</div><br />Why wouldn't custom gamecode be allowed?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p211658" date="Posted: Tue Feb 24, 2009 10:47 amÂ "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">
