<br/><br/>
1.) what is the optimal number (or maybe just a good target number) of bones to keep things efficent for NPC monsters and for multiplayer characters?&#13;
<br/><br/>
2.) There are some 'floating' bones on some of the Q4 monster rigs that seem to translate around, particularly on the chest of the beserker.  How are those set up? &#13;
<br/><br/>
3.) The rigs in Q4 use an inverted foot rig, should I stick to that or can I do the heel-less rig to save bones?&#13;
<br/><br/>

<br/>
With some mods being forced to stop in part due to a lack of animators and with the extreme shortage of real animators in the Doom3 community We have started a think tank of animators offering their help to established mod teams in need of animation help.&#13;
<br/><br/>
The team members are:&#13;
<br/><ul><br/><li>BloodRayne - Weapons Animation Advice&#13;
<br/></li><li>crimity&#13;
<br/></li><li>der_ton - Technical Advisor&#13;
<br/></li></ul><br/>
Tentative Members:&#13;
<br/><ul><br/><li>Johnny B. Goode&#13;
<br/></li><li>fault_line&#13;
<br/></li></ul><br/>
On a side note: <span style="font-weight: bold">We need more animators and <span style="text-decoration: underline">I know they're out there</span></span>. This idea (and some mods as well) will stand or fall with finding animators capable of spending time on this. I myself am really *really* busy but I feel it's important to contribute to this <span style="font-weight: bold">so I will step up myself as the first member</span>, but not as teamleader. I have knowledge and some experience in animating weapons and I would like to share whatever I know with the modding community.&#13;
<br/><br/>
So, if you can animate for Doom3 or if you are an animator for a modteam currently working on a mod then I would like to ask you to join the Animators Think Tank that will help out the entire modding community and hopefully prevent more mods from having to stop due to the lack of Animators currently available for Doom3.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Mod teams can ask the Animators Think Tank (or ATT in short) for help, with only a few conditions in return: &#13;
<br/><ul><br/><li>The mod team has read and tried the several tutorials available to them. (will be made available in this thread/post).&#13;
<br/><br/></li><li>The mod team tries to learn as much as possible from this help in order to learn the animation part as soon as possible so they can carry on the work for the mod themselves. &#13;
<br/><br/></li><li>Help can consist of making example animations and scenes for the current 3d packages available. The Animators Think Tank is *not* a quick way to have some people animate stuff for your mod, it should be a great step forward into learning animation and should offer you real tangeable help in the form of example scenes with the models of the mod in question.&#13;
<br/><br/></li><li>The mod team asking for help is working for an established mod, has a working, finished, model that needs to be animated and have a website with screenshots to prove it.&#13;
<br/><br/></li><li>If a future animator succesfully learns from the mod team then he/she offers his/her services to the Think Tank so we can help others out as well.</li></ul><br/>_________________<br/>Hexen Edge Of Chaos&#13;

Maybe the best way to get the best "bang-for-buck" is to make it a condition that mod makers can only ask the ATT for a tutorial to be written for an specific area (but not for a specific mod or specific model). That way general information any mod maker can use is produced.<br/>_________________<br/>Want Australian Robotic Info?&#13;

Well, when you have a million other things that need to be done, it is hard to also try to learn modeling....  I have learned to animate, but will not have enough free time for quite a while to learn to model any thing decent <img src="/web/20061013061221im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0"/>  I just have far too many other things I am responsible for <img src="/web/20061013061221im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0"/><br/>_________________<br/>Check out my mod:  <a href="/web/20061013061221/http://www.doomchronicles.com/" target="_blank">www.doomchronicles.com</a>&#13;

<br/><br/>
it seems like if a total conversion team can't find an animator, they quit. if a tc team can't find one, then the lead person should scale back the scope of the mod and then take the time to learn the basics of animating. isn't that better then trashing everything?&#13;
<br/><br/>
imo, all these tc's that are quitting start off with a project that's too ambitious.&#13;
<br/><br/>
just my opinion. sorry to get off topic...<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Download: </span><a href="/web/20061013061221/http://www.pcgamemods.com/user/6056.html" target="_blank" class="postlink">My Doom3 mods</a>.</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

This thread shouldn't get off topic, TC's mean a great big bunch of work and animation is one of the toughest things to work on in the mod.

Yes,  software for lip sync has been around awhile..  ive used <a href="/web/20061013061221/http://www.thirdwishsoftware.com/magpie.html" target="_blank">http://www.thirdwishsoftware.com/magpie.html</a> in the past,  but find while its great for working out timings,  using it to auto-animate is simply not good enough for quality work.    Once you get rolling with manually animating morphs or targets,   its a fairly fast process and doesnt really require additional software.&#13;

<br/>
With some mods being forced to stop in part due to a lack of animators and with the extreme shortage of real animators in the Doom3 community We have started a think tank of animators offering their help to established mod teams in need of animation help.&#13;
<br/><br/>
The team members are:&#13;
<br/><ul><br/><li>BloodRayne - Weapons Animation Advice&#13;
<br/></li><li>crimity&#13;
<br/></li><li>der_ton - Technical Advisor&#13;
<br/></li></ul><br/>
Tentative Members:&#13;
<br/><ul><br/><li>Johnny B. Goode&#13;
<br/></li><li>fault_line&#13;
<br/></li></ul><br/>
On a side note: <span style="font-weight: bold">We need more animators and <span style="text-decoration: underline">I know they're out there</span></span>. This idea (and some mods as well) will stand or fall with finding animators capable of spending time on this. I myself am really *really* busy but I feel it's important to contribute to this <span style="font-weight: bold">so I will step up myself as the first member</span>, but not as teamleader. I have knowledge and some experience in animating weapons and I would like to share whatever I know with the modding community.&#13;
<br/><br/>
So, if you can animate for Doom3 or if you are an animator for a modteam currently working on a mod then I would like to ask you to join the Animators Think Tank that will help out the entire modding community and hopefully prevent more mods from having to stop due to the lack of Animators currently available for Doom3.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Mod teams can ask the Animators Think Tank (or ATT in short) for help, with only a few conditions in return: &#13;
<br/><ul><br/><li>The mod team has read and tried the several tutorials available to them. (will be made available in this thread/post).&#13;
<br/><br/></li><li>The mod team tries to learn as much as possible from this help in order to learn the animation part as soon as possible so they can carry on the work for the mod themselves. &#13;
<br/><br/></li><li>Help can consist of making example animations and scenes for the current 3d packages available. The Animators Think Tank is *not* a quick way to have some people animate stuff for your mod, it should be a great step forward into learning animation and should offer you real tangeable help in the form of example scenes with the models of the mod in question.&#13;
<br/><br/></li><li>The mod team asking for help is working for an established mod, has a working, finished, model that needs to be animated and have a website with screenshots to prove it.&#13;
<br/><br/></li><li>If a future animator succesfully learns from the mod team then he/she offers his/her services to the Think Tank so we can help others out as well.</li></ul><br/>_________________<br/>Hexen Edge Of Chaos&#13;

Maybe the best way to get the best "bang-for-buck" is to make it a condition that mod makers can only ask the ATT for a tutorial to be written for an specific area (but not for a specific mod or specific model).

Well, when you have a million other things that need to be done, it is hard to also try to learn modeling....  I have learned to animate, but will not have enough free time for quite a while to learn to model any thing decent <img src="/web/20061013055559im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0"/>  I just have far too many other things I am responsible for <img src="/web/20061013055559im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0"/><br/>_________________<br/>Check out my mod:  <a href="/web/20061013055559/http://www.doomchronicles.com/" target="_blank">www.doomchronicles.com</a>&#13;

<br/><br/>
it seems like if a total conversion team can't find an animator, they quit. if a tc team can't find one, then the lead person should scale back the scope of the mod and then take the time to learn the basics of animating. isn't that better then trashing everything?&#13;

imo, all these tc's that are quitting start off with a project that's too ambitious.&#13;

This thread shouldn't get off topic, TC's mean a great big bunch of work and animation is one of the toughest things to work on in the mod.

Yes,  software for lip sync has been around awhile..  ive used <a href="/web/20061013055559/http://www.thirdwishsoftware.com/magpie.html" target="_blank">http://www.thirdwishsoftware.com/magpie.html</a> in the past,  but find while its great for working out timings,  using it to auto-animate is simply not good enough for quality work.    Once you get rolling with manually animating morphs or targets,   its a fairly fast process and doesnt really require additional software.&#13;

I'm working towards becoming a D3 mod animator myself (I have already become a bit of a modeller), but I have to say that the way it's done in Doom 3 is way beyond me so far (haven't yet learned to use bones, which is what Id have used).&#13;
<br/><br/>
Right now I'm just sorta poking around, checking out Doom 3's models (sadly, the MD5 importer for Max I have got my hands on as of now has a beef with animation files, so I can't really check out Id's animations yet).&#13;
<br/><br/>
You can probably expect me to ask some questions (but hopefully, I will be able to help out eventually).&#13;

<br/><br/>
 Im just trying to animate some weaponry for Cody64  ive used maya b4 for animating I know abit about bones IKs Constraints and such.....But wouldnt it be easier if there were just a couple of arms all ready rigged with IKs and Controls.&#13;
<br/>
Im just finding it hard trying to move the arms around from the MG without distorting the polys to much.&#13;
<br/>
Theres alot of stuff in doom that im not sure about....&#13;
<br/>
Im not to sure why the MG bones come from the origin....cos Im thinking if I have to rig it myself then do I have to do that to?&#13;
<br/>
Like the skinnig is smooth not rigid but can i still ridid bind the skin....and if so can I use flexors?&#13;
<br/>
Is there a set guide line the doom animators worked from cos Im sure that would help alot of people out....just so they know in which order to at least proceed.&#13;
<br/>
I like animating alot, its heaps of fun (when everythings rigged properly) its just getting everything rigged properly that kinda sux.&#13;
<br/>
Anyway the Animations for Doom3 fully Rock ..just watching the way the MG reloads is so cool...Thanx for allowing us to check them out!!&#13;

No flexors will not export to d3.. assuming flexors are somewhat similar to 3dsmax's bulge tool (used to make muscles bulge and such.. doesnt apply weight information)..  D3 looks only at weights for vertices.. for the bones though, it looks at all normal transformations (move scale rotate)..&#13;
<br/><br/>
If you are getting distorted polys like that, check your weights.. Some vertices may be applied to the wrong bone.. or not blended between bones properly..  Or it might simply be the way your mesh is set up..&#13;
<br/><br/>
Sshots are very useful with questions like these.. (linked please)</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

<br/><a href="/web/20061013060716/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=8759" target="_blank" class="postlink">http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=8759</a>, most of which pertained to the .def file for the weapon.&#13;
<br/><br/>
As far as exporting the animations it depends on what you used to animate them. If you used maya, the exporter is built into doom3. The exports are usually done in the .def file for whatever you're creating, but this does not have to be so. It is explained here:<a href="/web/20061013060716/http://www.iddevnet.com/doom3/modelexport.php" target="_blank" class="postlink">http://www.iddevnet.com/doom3/modelexport.php</a> There is also a MD5 exporter script for maya here:<a href="/web/20061013060716/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=2517" target="_blank" class="postlink">http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=2517</a>, this will allow you to export everything to final format without using Doom3.&#13;
<br/><br/>
If you used a program other than maya, have no fear. You can either bring the models into maya to do the animations, or use one of several available export scripts for your prefered modeling package.&#13;

I'm working with blender, and I'm a noob, so I can't really tell you much about the other programs. I can, however, tell you that those pesky .def and .script files are dealt with in detail in the scripting forum.

I made a lip synced animation for my Grandmother for Xmas this year. You can download the "Sassy Senior" on my website. All the lip syncing was done in real time, with me speaking into a microphone. I did not tweak ANY of the lip syncing, so a couple of blips happen. However, the program I used was free. Again, real time, speaking into a microphone (once the dozen necessary morph targets had been made, of course). For animations, it worked great. It would also work great for game lip syncing IF der_ton were to rework his ADD-BONES MD5 exporter for Max a little bit. If that does not happen, then this little known program will serve no one any good for Doom 3, so I won't even mention its name. <img src="/web/20061013060716im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0"/><br/>_________________<br/><a href="/web/20061013060716/http://trepaning.com/" target="_blank" class="postlink">Good Bye!</a></span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

The bipedal premade rigs are a dream. As long as you name your bones like they want, it does all the rigging for you. You still have to skin and paint weights manually, but it takes a lot of the constraints work out of it.</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

<br/><br/>
Origin Bone&#13;
<br/>
The origin bone is imprtant... so much so that if it doesnt exist in your animation the exporter creates it. It defines the location of the character in the game... So the collision box is relitive to the origin.&#13;
<br/><br/>
If I were a mod crew without an animator, I would build my models and characters right over top of the DOOM3 models (probably using the md5importer) this way our team could take advantage of all the awesome work that Fred and the guys did for you. If the mod takes off ... you could always go back and add new animations or characters with you newfound millions in funding from some major publisher =)&#13;
<br/><br/>
In general the questions seem a bit vauge which makes answering them hard.&#13;

Thanks for adding that bit of info.. on a side note for others reading.. the entity itself can also follow the origin bone I believe.. So the animator can actually have it move around their modelling program without having to reposition the entire bone structure on export.. This is extremely nice when having a npc interact with the environment..  or just for walking animations even..&#13;

Ok, personally I see animating/exporting weaponsmodels and character/enemy models as two seperate things. (not all might agree) &#13;
<br/><br/>
I would start with the weapons, because they are generally speaking a little bit easier to understand, have less animations (usually only between 5 and 10 different anims) and will teach you the basics for animating for Doom3. The animations itself are quite selfexplanetory. You create bones, attach the bones to the model and animate those bones using keyframes or frame to frame animation. Then, if you position one bone in a certain way part of the model will move accordingly, etc..etc..&#13;
<br/><br/>
What kind of stuff/plugins you'll be using for this depends on which 3d program you use. So, before we can help we'll need to know is which 3d program you're using. Don't expect us to do any animating for you (unless you can find someone crazy enough to do it for you. <img src="/web/20061013060716im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0"/> ) &#13;
<br/><br/>
The main goal is to teach you how to do it yourself, so you can help others out in the future.  <img src="/web/20061013060716im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0"/><br/>_________________<br/>Hexen Edge Of Chaos&#13;

Since i'm working on a new Beretta gun in Lightwave, I'm really scared by the MD5 exporters situation for this program. As far as I can remember, only the Bozo exporter is available at the moment, but it only supports 1 material declaration per model.. Pratically useless, since a weapon contains at least 2 materials (character's arms material, gun materials etc..)&#13;

So, I'm really scared by the fact that I've got to switch to another 3D app only to animate my models...&#13;

"f16_jet_engine" is a looped soundshader that starts to play at frame 1 and gets played by the origin bone by default.... you can also define in the entity which bone shall play the sound.........&#13;

So once started it plays it infinitive times back......&#13;

Now what I want to do is to make the trigger move. The tension of the rope is released and the rope is moved forward, and then the bolt will also move forward with lightning speed and push the bolt (which isnt present in the screenshot) out of the crossbow&#13;
<br/><br/>
I have 2 questions:&#13;
<br/><br/>
1) my crossbow is made up of 7-8 different layers of parts ie. trigger in one layer, handle in one layer etc, do I need to combine them?&#13;
<br/>
2) How do I actually get the crossbow to behave in the above-mentioned way? Any help will be appreciated.

I know of Maya and Max being able to do this. If Lightwave can do it then animate in that. The main thing to know is that anything you want to have animation on needs to be animated with bones. Nothing can be animated inside Doom3 with the old Quake3 method of blend verts.&#13;
<br/><br/>
So if you wanted to have the crossbow shoot an arrow, the string needs to be animated with bones, so does the arrow and the hand pulling the trigger and whatever else.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Within Max, the way der_ton's exporter work everything has to be a single mesh. You can't have the arrow a seperate mesh and soforth. Then it just has to be skinned and weighted on the bones you provide to animate each part. The exporter also allow you to use whatever tool is to your disposal like IK or constraints or directly animating it. All this is also possible from within Maya accept for the export to be a longer process and I don't think you have to have a single mesh.

Some confusion might come into some of the posts from Brian in some threads where he talks about der_ton's exporter being able to generate bones for you based on vertex movement. As far as I know it was an experimental exporter made by der_ton to make it possible for easier facial animation. It's not very "game" friendly though because it generates a bone per vertex which ends up being way too much.&#13;
<br/><br/>
The bottom line is that bones is the one and only method to animate in Doom3. Of course the scripted animation is possible on "solid" objects with simple translation and rotation that can be done, no "vertex level" animation like for characters.</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

<br />With some mods being forced to stop in part due to a lack of animators and with the extreme shortage of real animators in the Doom3 community We have started a think tank of animators offering their help to established mod teams in need of animation help.
<br /><br />The team members are:
<br /><ul><li>BloodRayne - Weapons Animation Advice</li><li>crimity</li><li>der_ton - Technical Advisor</li></ul>Tentative Members:<br /><ul><li>Johnny B. Goode</li><li>fault_line</li></ul>On a side note: <span style="font-weight: bold">We need more animators and <span style="text-decoration: underline">I know they're out there</span></span>. This idea (and some mods as well) will stand or fall with finding animators capable of spending time on this. I myself am really *really* busy but I feel it's important to contribute to this <span style="font-weight: bold">so I will step up myself as the first member</span>, but not as teamleader. I have knowledge and some experience in animating weapons and I would like to share whatever I know with the modding community.<br /><br />So, if you can animate for Doom3 or if you are an animator for a modteam currently working on a mod then I would like to ask you to join the Animators Think Tank that will help out the entire modding community and hopefully prevent more mods from having to stop due to the lack of Animators currently available for Doom3.<br /><br />Mod teams can ask the Animators Think Tank (or ATT in short) for help, with only a few conditions in return: <br /><ul><li>The mod team has read and tried the several tutorials available to them. (will be made available in this thread/post).<br /></li><li>The mod team tries to learn as much as possible from this help in order to learn the animation part as soon as possible so they can carry on the work for the mod themselves. <br /></li><li>Help can consist of making example animations and scenes for the current 3d packages available. The Animators Think Tank is *not* a quick way to have some people animate stuff for your mod, it should be a great step forward into learning animation and should offer you real tangeable help in the form of example scenes with the models of the mod in question.<br /></li><li>The mod team asking for help is working for an established mod, has a working, finished, model that needs to be animated and have a website with screenshots to prove it.<br /></li><li>If a future animator succesfully learns from the mod team then he/she offers his/her services to the Think Tank so we can help others out as well.</li></ul></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74330" date="Posted: Wed Jan 26, 2005 10:22 pm "><author>doomkid3000</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">this is a good thread we should sticky this for animators helping out i think when they setup there models for animation they should rig them with IK's so they can be animated with ease <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225014318im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74343" date="Posted: Wed Jan 26, 2005 11:28 pm "><author>rich_is_bored</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Sticky like the inside of Pee Wee's pants. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225014318im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74401" date="Posted: Thu Jan 27, 2005 4:03 am "><author>Johnny B.

<br /><br />Well, when you have a million other things that need to be done, it is hard to also try to learn modeling....  I have learned to animate, but will not have enough free time for quite a while to learn to model any thing decent <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225014318im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />  I just have far too many other things I am responsible for <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225014318im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74556" date="Posted: Thu Jan 27, 2005 6:03 pm "><author>pbmax</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">understood.
<br /><br />it seems like if a total conversion team can't find an animator, they quit. if a tc team can't find one, then the lead person should scale back the scope of the mod and then take the time to learn the basics of animating. isn't that better then trashing everything?
<br /><br />imo, all these tc's that are quitting start off with a project that's too ambitious.
<br /><br />just my opinion. sorry to get off topic...</div>]]></body></post><post id="p74886" date="Posted: Sat Jan 29, 2005 10:29 am "><author>BloodRayne</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Johnny B.

<br /><br />Yes,  software for lip sync has been around awhile..  ive used <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225014318/http://www.thirdwishsoftware.com/magpie.html">http://www.thirdwishsoftware.com/magpie.html</a><!-- m --> in the past,  but find while its great for working out timings,  using it to auto-animate is simply not good enough for quality work.    Once you get rolling with manually animating morphs or targets,   its a fairly fast process and doesnt really require additional software.

<br />Well animators are a rare species in all mod work and fan communities.
<br />It is a pretty hard step to go from 2d drawing to 3d modeling for many. And from that, to 4d animating is even harder. There arent too many tutorials on the internet from which one can learn the basics of animating, which is bad.

<br /><br />Look at what other people have done as far as animating walk cycles and the like goes.  In example, you could import the .md5anim of the walk cycle for Doom3, and check it out.

<br />With some mods being forced to stop in part due to a lack of animators and with the extreme shortage of real animators in the Doom3 community We have started a think tank of animators offering their help to established mod teams in need of animation help.
<br /><br />The team members are:
<br /><ul><li>BloodRayne - Weapons Animation Advice</li><li>crimity</li><li>der_ton - Technical Advisor</li></ul>Tentative Members:<br /><ul><li>Johnny B. Goode</li><li>fault_line</li></ul>On a side note: <span style="font-weight: bold">We need more animators and <span style="text-decoration: underline">I know they're out there</span></span>. This idea (and some mods as well) will stand or fall with finding animators capable of spending time on this. I myself am really *really* busy but I feel it's important to contribute to this <span style="font-weight: bold">so I will step up myself as the first member</span>, but not as teamleader. I have knowledge and some experience in animating weapons and I would like to share whatever I know with the modding community.<br /><br />So, if you can animate for Doom3 or if you are an animator for a modteam currently working on a mod then I would like to ask you to join the Animators Think Tank that will help out the entire modding community and hopefully prevent more mods from having to stop due to the lack of Animators currently available for Doom3.<br /><br />Mod teams can ask the Animators Think Tank (or ATT in short) for help, with only a few conditions in return: <br /><ul><li>The mod team has read and tried the several tutorials available to them. (will be made available in this thread/post).<br /></li><li>The mod team tries to learn as much as possible from this help in order to learn the animation part as soon as possible so they can carry on the work for the mod themselves. <br /></li><li>Help can consist of making example animations and scenes for the current 3d packages available. The Animators Think Tank is *not* a quick way to have some people animate stuff for your mod, it should be a great step forward into learning animation and should offer you real tangeable help in the form of example scenes with the models of the mod in question.<br /></li><li>The mod team asking for help is working for an established mod, has a working, finished, model that needs to be animated and have a website with screenshots to prove it.<br /></li><li>If a future animator succesfully learns from the mod team then he/she offers his/her services to the Think Tank so we can help others out as well.</li></ul></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74330" date="Posted: Wed Jan 26, 2005 10:22 pm "><author>doomkid3000</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">this is a good thread we should sticky this for animators helping out i think when they setup there models for animation they should rig them with IK's so they can be animated with ease <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225014428im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74343" date="Posted: Wed Jan 26, 2005 11:28 pm "><author>rich_is_bored</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Sticky like the inside of Pee Wee's pants. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225014428im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74401" date="Posted: Thu Jan 27, 2005 4:03 am "><author>Johnny B.

<br /><br />it seems like if a total conversion team can't find an animator, they quit. if a tc team can't find one, then the lead person should scale back the scope of the mod and then take the time to learn the basics of animating. isn't that better then trashing everything?
<br /><br />imo, all these tc's that are quitting start off with a project that's too ambitious.
<br /><br />just my opinion. sorry to get off topic...</div>]]></body></post><post id="p74886" date="Posted: Sat Jan 29, 2005 10:29 am "><author>BloodRayne</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Johnny B.

<br /><br />Yes,  software for lip sync has been around awhile..  ive used <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225014428/http://www.thirdwishsoftware.com/magpie.html">http://www.thirdwishsoftware.com/magpie.html</a><!-- m --> in the past,  but find while its great for working out timings,  using it to auto-animate is simply not good enough for quality work.    Once you get rolling with manually animating morphs or targets,   its a fairly fast process and doesnt really require additional software.

<br /><br /> Im just trying to animate some weaponry for Cody64  ive used maya b4 for animating I know abit about bones IKs Constraints and such.....But wouldnt it be easier if there were just a couple of arms all ready rigged with IKs and Controls.
<br />Im just finding it hard trying to move the arms around from the MG without distorting the polys to much.
<br />Theres alot of stuff in doom that im not sure about....
<br />Im not to sure why the MG bones come from the origin....cos Im thinking if I have to rig it myself then do I have to do that to?
<br />Like the skinnig is smooth not rigid but can i still ridid bind the skin....and if so can I use flexors?
<br />Is there a set guide line the doom animators worked from cos Im sure that would help alot of people out....just so they know in which order to at least proceed.
<br />I like animating alot, its heaps of fun (when everythings rigged properly) its just getting everything rigged properly that kinda sux.
<br />Anyway the Animations for Doom3 fully Rock ..just watching the way the MG reloads is so cool...Thanx for allowing us to check them out!!

D3 looks only at weights for vertices.. for the bones though, it looks at all normal transformations (move scale rotate)..
<br /><br />If you are getting distorted polys like that, check your weights.. Some vertices may be applied to the wrong bone.. or not blended between bones properly..  Or it might simply be the way your mesh is set up..

<br /><a href="viewtopic.php?t=8759" class="postlink">http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=8759</a>, most of which pertained to the .def file for the weapon.
<br /><br />As far as exporting the animations it depends on what you used to animate them. If you used maya, the exporter is built into doom3. The exports are usually done in the .def file for whatever you're creating, but this does not have to be so. It is explained here:<a href="../../www.iddevnet.com/doom3/modelexport.php" class="postlink">http://www.iddevnet.com/doom3/modelexport.php</a> There is also a MD5 exporter script for maya here:<a href="viewtopic.php?t=2517" class="postlink">http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=2517</a>, this will allow you to export everything to final format without using Doom3.
<br /><br />If you used a program other than maya, have no fear. You can either bring the models into maya to do the animations, or use one of several available export scripts for your prefered modeling package.
<br /><br />der_ton has created import and export scripts for blender, they can be found here:

<br /><br />I'm working with blender, and I'm a noob, so I can't really tell you much about the other programs. I can, however, tell you that those pesky .def and .script files are dealt with in detail in the scripting forum.

<br /><br />I made a lip synced animation for my Grandmother for Xmas this year. You can download the "Sassy Senior" on my website. All the lip syncing was done in real time, with me speaking into a microphone. I did not tweak ANY of the lip syncing, so a couple of blips happen. However, the program I used was free. Again, real time, speaking into a microphone (once the dozen necessary morph targets had been made, of course). For animations, it worked great. It would also work great for game lip syncing IF der_ton were to rework his ADD-BONES MD5 exporter for Max a little bit. If that does not happen, then this little known program will serve no one any good for Doom 3, so I won't even mention its name. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225023057im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p77977" date="Posted: Thu Feb 17, 2005 10:27 am "><author>SyPHer_</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Brain Trepaning wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">"Sassy Senior"</div>

<br /><br />Origin Bone
<br />The origin bone is imprtant... so much so that if it doesnt exist in your animation the exporter creates it. It defines the location of the character in the game... So the collision box is relitive to the origin.
<br /><br />If I were a mod crew without an animator, I would build my models and characters right over top of the DOOM3 models (probably using the md5importer) this way our team could take advantage of all the awesome work that Fred and the guys did for you. If the mod takes off ... you could always go back and add new animations or characters with you newfound millions in funding from some major publisher =)

So the animator can actually have it move around their modelling program without having to reposition the entire bone structure on export.. This is extremely nice when having a npc interact with the environment..  or just for walking animations even..

<br /><br />Ok, personally I see animating/exporting weaponsmodels and character/enemy models as two seperate things. (not all might agree) 
<br /><br />I would start with the weapons, because they are generally speaking a little bit easier to understand, have less animations (usually only between 5 and 10 different anims) and will teach you the basics for animating for Doom3. The animations itself are quite selfexplanetory. You create bones, attach the bones to the model and animate those bones using keyframes or frame to frame animation. Then, if you position one bone in a certain way part of the model will move accordingly, etc..etc..
<br /><br />What kind of stuff/plugins you'll be using for this depends on which 3d program you use. So, before we can help we'll need to know is which 3d program you're using. Don't expect us to do any animating for you (unless you can find someone crazy enough to do it for you. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225023057im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> ) 
<br /><br />The main goal is to teach you how to do it yourself, so you can help others out in the future.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225023057im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p93812" date="Posted: Thu May 12, 2005 11:41 am "><author>Rayne</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">HI, a little and quick question...

<br /><br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">model f16_jet {<br />   mesh      models/chris_md5/f16_jet.md5mesh   <br />   anim f16flyby   models/chris_md5/f16_jet.md5anim {<br />   frame 1      sound f16_jet_engine<br />   }<br />}<br /><br />entityDef f16_jet {      <br />      "inherit"   "func_animate"<br />      "model"      "f16_jet"<br />}</div>
<br /><br />"f16_jet_engine" is a looped soundshader that starts to play at frame 1 and gets played by the origin bone by default.... you can also define in the entity which bone shall play the sound.........
<br /><br />So once started it plays it infinitive times back......
<br /><br />I hope this might wind up useful for other ppl aswell......</div>]]></body></post><post id="p97853" date="Posted: Fri Jun 03, 2005 8:16 am "><author>bad marine ass</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Ok guys I have a bit of a problem with animation.

<br /><br />Now what I want to do is to make the trigger move. The tension of the rope is released and the rope is moved forward, and then the bolt will also move forward with lightning speed and push the bolt (which isnt present in the screenshot) out of the crossbow
<br /><br />I have 2 questions:
<br /><br />1) my crossbow is made up of 7-8 different layers of parts ie. trigger in one layer, handle in one layer etc, do I need to combine them?
<br />2) How do I actually get the crossbow to behave in the above-mentioned way? Any help will be appreciated.

I know of Maya and Max being able to do this. If Lightwave can do it then animate in that. The main thing to know is that anything you want to have animation on needs to be animated with bones. Nothing can be animated inside Doom3 with the old Quake3 method of blend verts.
<br /><br />So if you wanted to have the crossbow shoot an arrow, the string needs to be animated with bones, so does the arrow and the hand pulling the trigger and whatever else.
<br /><br />Within Max, the way der_ton's exporter work everything has to be a single mesh. You can't have the arrow a seperate mesh and soforth. Then it just has to be skinned and weighted on the bones you provide to animate each part. The exporter also allow you to use whatever tool is to your disposal like IK or constraints or directly animating it. All this is also possible from within Maya accept for the export to be a longer process and I don't think you have to have a single mesh.

<br /><br />Some confusion might come into some of the posts from Brian in some threads where he talks about der_ton's exporter being able to generate bones for you based on vertex movement. As far as I know it was an experimental exporter made by der_ton to make it possible for easier facial animation. It's not very "game" friendly though because it generates a bone per vertex which ends up being way too much.
<br /><br />The bottom line is that bones is the one and only method to animate in Doom3. Of course the scripted animation is possible on "solid" objects with simple translation and rotation that can be done, no "vertex level" animation like for characters.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p98865" date="Posted: Fri Jun 10, 2005 9:36 pm "><author>bad marine ass</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">ok that clears things up a lot, thank you all <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225014232im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p100612" date="Posted: Fri Jun 24, 2005 6:45 am "><author>Flux</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I'm an animator.

<br />Well animators are a rare species in all mod work and fan communities.
<br />It is a pretty hard step to go from 2d drawing to 3d modeling for many. And from that, to 4d animating is even harder. There arent too many tutorials on the internet from which one can learn the basics of animating, which is bad.
<br /><br />If you have done professional work animating, it could be good to have a tutorial presenting how ones makes simple walk cycles and whatnot.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p181613" date="Posted: Thu Jun 21, 2007 6:48 pm "><author>bhenderson</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">nihil sub sole novum.
<br /><br />Regarding the lack of tutorials:
<br /><br />Look at what other people have done as far as animating walk cycles and the like goes.  In example, you could import the .md5anim of the walk cycle for Doom3, and check it out.
<br /><br />Also, 2d animation is very similar to 3d animation, so check out some 2d animation tutorials as well -- you might be surprised.

<br />With some mods being forced to stop in part due to a lack of animators and with the extreme shortage of real animators in the Doom3 community We have started a think tank of animators offering their help to established mod teams in need of animation help.
<br /><br />The team members are:

This idea (and some mods as well) will stand or fall with finding animators capable of spending time on this. I myself am really *really* busy but I feel it's important to contribute to this <span style="font-weight: bold">so I will step up myself as the first member</span>, but not as teamleader.

						<div class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold">Welcome to the Animators Think Tank!</span>
<br />With some mods being forced to stop in part due to a lack of animators and with the extreme shortage of real animators in the Doom3 community We have started a think tank of animators offering their help to established mod teams in need of animation help.
<br /><br />The team members are:
<br /><ul><li>BloodRayne - Weapons Animation Advice</li><li>crimity</li><li>der_ton - Technical Advisor</li></ul>Tentative Members:<br /><ul><li>Johnny B. Goode</li><li>fault_line</li></ul>On a side note: <span style="font-weight: bold">We need more animators and <span style="text-decoration: underline">I know they're out there</span></span>. This idea (and some mods as well) will stand or fall with finding animators capable of spending time on this. I myself am really *really* busy but I feel it's important to contribute to this <span style="font-weight: bold">so I will step up myself as the first member</span>, but not as teamleader. I have knowledge and some experience in animating weapons and I would like to share whatever I know with the modding community.<br /><br />So, if you can animate for Doom3 or if you are an animator for a modteam currently working on a mod then I would like to ask you to join the Animators Think Tank that will help out the entire modding community and hopefully prevent more mods from having to stop due to the lack of Animators currently available for Doom3.<br /><br />Mod teams can ask the Animators Think Tank (or ATT in short) for help, with only a few conditions in return: <br /><ul><li>The mod team has read and tried the several tutorials available to them. (will be made available in this thread/post).<br /></li><li>The mod team tries to learn as much as possible from this help in order to learn the animation part as soon as possible so they can carry on the work for the mod themselves. <br /></li><li>Help can consist of making example animations and scenes for the current 3d packages available. The Animators Think Tank is *not* a quick way to have some people animate stuff for your mod, it should be a great step forward into learning animation and should offer you real tangeable help in the form of example scenes with the models of the mod in question.<br /></li><li>The mod team asking for help is working for an established mod, has a working, finished, model that needs to be animated and have a website with screenshots to prove it.<br /></li><li>If a future animator succesfully learns from the mod team then he/she offers his/her services to the Think Tank so we can help others out as well.</li></ul></div>

						<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">BloodRayne wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />1 - The mod team tries to learn as much as possible from this help in order to learn the animation part as soon as possible so they can carry on the work for the mod themselves. <br /><br />2 - Help can consist of making example animations and scenes for the current 3d packages available. The Animators Think Tank is *not* a quick way to have some people animate stuff for your mod, it should be a great step forward into learning animation and should offer you real tangeable help in the form of example scenes with the models of the mod in question.<br /></div>
<br /><br />Maybe the best way to get the best "bang-for-buck" is to make it a condition that mod makers can only ask the ATT for a tutorial to be written for an specific area (but not for a specific mod or specific model). That way general information any mod maker can use is produced.</div>

						<div class="postbody">understood.
<br /><br />it seems like if a total conversion team can't find an animator, they quit. if a tc team can't find one, then the lead person should scale back the scope of the mod and then take the time to learn the basics of animating. isn't that better then trashing everything?
<br /><br />imo, all these tc's that are quitting start off with a project that's too ambitious.
<br /><br />just my opinion. sorry to get off topic...</div>

<br /><br />This thread shouldn't get off topic, TC's mean a great big bunch of work and animation is one of the toughest things to work on in the mod. It's the most time consuming and trying part of making TC's, let's leave it at that. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>

I know of Maya and Max being able to do this. If Lightwave can do it then animate in that. The main thing to know is that anything you want to have animation on needs to be animated with bones. Nothing can be animated inside Doom3 with the old Quake3 method of blend verts.&#13;<br /><br />So if you wanted to have the crossbow shoot an arrow, the string needs to be animated with bones, so does the arrow and the hand pulling the trigger and whatever else.&#13;<br /><br />Within Max, the way der_ton's exporter work everything has to be a single mesh. You can't have the arrow a seperate mesh and soforth. Then it just has to be skinned and weighted on the bones you provide to animate each part. The exporter also allow you to use whatever tool is to your disposal like IK or constraints or directly animating it. All this is also possible from within Maya accept for the export to be a longer process and I don't think you have to have a single mesh. I'm sorry I have no experience with Lightwave.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p98837" date="Posted: Fri Jun 10, 2005 4:49 pm "><author>bad marine ass</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Brian mentioned this in his reply to my query&#13;<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">For the first question, it doesn't really matter a whole lot which <br />method you use to animate as long as the exported file contains only <br />bones.</div>&#13;<br /><br />Which means that the only way, the one and only way to animate, is through bones?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p98851" date="Posted: Fri Jun 10, 2005 6:44 pm "><author>obihb</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Yes. It has to be bones.&#13;<br /><br />Some confusion might come into some of the posts from Brian in some threads where he talks about der_ton's exporter being able to generate bones for you based on vertex movement. As far as I know it was an experimental exporter made by der_ton to make it possible for easier facial animation. It's not very "game" friendly though because it generates a bone per vertex which ends up being way too much.&#13;<br /><br />The bottom line is that bones is the one and only method to animate in Doom3. Of course the scripted animation is possible on "solid" objects with simple translation and rotation that can be done, no "vertex level" animation like for characters.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p74327" date="Posted: Wed Jan 26, 2005 10:16 pm "><author>BloodRayne</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold">Welcome to the Animators Think Tank!</span>
<br />With some mods being forced to stop in part due to a lack of animators and with the extreme shortage of real animators in the Doom3 community We have started a think tank of animators offering their help to established mod teams in need of animation help.
<br /><br />The team members are:
<br /><ul><li>BloodRayne - Weapons Animation Advice</li><li>crimity</li><li>der_ton - Technical Advisor</li></ul>Tentative Members:<br /><ul><li>Johnny B. Goode</li><li>fault_line</li></ul>On a side note: <span style="font-weight: bold">We need more animators and <span style="text-decoration: underline">I know they're out there</span></span>. This idea (and some mods as well) will stand or fall with finding animators capable of spending time on this. I myself am really *really* busy but I feel it's important to contribute to this <span style="font-weight: bold">so I will step up myself as the first member</span>, but not as teamleader. I have knowledge and some experience in animating weapons and I would like to share whatever I know with the modding community.<br /><br />So, if you can animate for Doom3 or if you are an animator for a modteam currently working on a mod then I would like to ask you to join the Animators Think Tank that will help out the entire modding community and hopefully prevent more mods from having to stop due to the lack of Animators currently available for Doom3.<br /><br />Mod teams can ask the Animators Think Tank (or ATT in short) for help, with only a few conditions in return: <br /><ul><li>The mod team has read and tried the several tutorials available to them. (will be made available in this thread/post).<br /></li><li>The mod team tries to learn as much as possible from this help in order to learn the animation part as soon as possible so they can carry on the work for the mod themselves. <br /></li><li>Help can consist of making example animations and scenes for the current 3d packages available. The Animators Think Tank is *not* a quick way to have some people animate stuff for your mod, it should be a great step forward into learning animation and should offer you real tangeable help in the form of example scenes with the models of the mod in question.<br /></li><li>The mod team asking for help is working for an established mod, has a working, finished, model that needs to be animated and have a website with screenshots to prove it.<br /></li><li>If a future animator succesfully learns from the mod team then he/she offers his/her services to the Think Tank so we can help others out as well.</li></ul></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74330" date="Posted: Wed Jan 26, 2005 10:22 pm "><author>doomkid3000</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">this is a good thread we should sticky this for animators helping out i think when they setup there models for animation they should rig them with IK's so they can be animated with ease <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225014428im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74343" date="Posted: Wed Jan 26, 2005 11:28 pm "><author>rich_is_bored</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Sticky like the inside of Pee Wee's pants. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225014428im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74401" date="Posted: Thu Jan 27, 2005 4:03 am "><author>Johnny B.

<br /><br />it seems like if a total conversion team can't find an animator, they quit. if a tc team can't find one, then the lead person should scale back the scope of the mod and then take the time to learn the basics of animating. isn't that better then trashing everything?
<br /><br />imo, all these tc's that are quitting start off with a project that's too ambitious.

Once you get rolling with manually animating morphs or targets,   its a fairly fast process and doesnt really require additional software.

Im not sure which 3D package you use,   but it may possible you can setup key bone poses and copy paste within the software.

<br />The bone phoneme positions in the face are created in negative frames then using the plugin they're essentially pasted into the frame you choose.

<br /><br /> Im just trying to animate some weaponry for Cody64  ive used maya b4 for animating I know abit about bones IKs Constraints and such.....But wouldnt it be easier if there were just a couple of arms all ready rigged with IKs and Controls.
<br />Im just finding it hard trying to move the arms around from the MG without distorting the polys to much.
<br />Theres alot of stuff in doom that im not sure about....
<br />Im not to sure why the MG bones come from the origin....cos Im thinking if I have to rig it myself then do I have to do that to?
<br />Like the skinnig is smooth not rigid but can i still ridid bind the skin....and if so can I use flexors?
<br />Is there a set guide line the doom animators worked from cos Im sure that would help alot of people out....just so they know in which order to at least proceed.
<br />I like animating alot, its heaps of fun (when everythings rigged properly) its just getting everything rigged properly that kinda sux.

D3 looks only at weights for vertices.. for the bones though, it looks at all normal transformations (move scale rotate)..
<br /><br />If you are getting distorted polys like that, check your weights.. Some vertices may be applied to the wrong bone.. or not blended between bones properly..  Or it might simply be the way your mesh is set up..

<br /><a href="viewtopic.php?t=8759" class="postlink">http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=8759</a>, most of which pertained to the .def file for the weapon.
<br /><br />As far as exporting the animations it depends on what you used to animate them. If you used maya, the exporter is built into doom3. The exports are usually done in the .def file for whatever you're creating, but this does not have to be so. It is explained here:<a href="../../www.iddevnet.com/doom3/modelexport.php" class="postlink">http://www.iddevnet.com/doom3/modelexport.php</a> There is also a MD5 exporter script for maya here:<a href="viewtopic.php?t=2517" class="postlink">http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=2517</a>, this will allow you to export everything to final format without using Doom3.
<br /><br />If you used a program other than maya, have no fear. You can either bring the models into maya to do the animations, or use one of several available export scripts for your prefered modeling package.
<br /><br />der_ton has created import and export scripts for blender, they can be found here:

<br /><br />I'm working with blender, and I'm a noob, so I can't really tell you much about the other programs. I can, however, tell you that those pesky .def and .script files are dealt with in detail in the scripting forum. If you're having a specific problem just post it and I'm sure everybody will do their best to help you out.

<br /><br />I made a lip synced animation for my Grandmother for Xmas this year. You can download the "Sassy Senior" on my website. All the lip syncing was done in real time, with me speaking into a microphone. I did not tweak ANY of the lip syncing, so a couple of blips happen. However, the program I used was free. Again, real time, speaking into a microphone (once the dozen necessary morph targets had been made, of course). For animations, it worked great. It would also work great for game lip syncing IF der_ton were to rework his ADD-BONES MD5 exporter for Max a little bit. If that does not happen, then this little known program will serve no one any good for Doom 3, so I won't even mention its name. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225023057im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p77977" date="Posted: Thu Feb 17, 2005 10:27 am "><author>SyPHer_</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Brain Trepaning wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">"Sassy Senior"</div>

<br /><br />Origin Bone
<br />The origin bone is imprtant... so much so that if it doesnt exist in your animation the exporter creates it. It defines the location of the character in the game... So the collision box is relitive to the origin.
<br /><br />If I were a mod crew without an animator, I would build my models and characters right over top of the DOOM3 models (probably using the md5importer) this way our team could take advantage of all the awesome work that Fred and the guys did for you. If the mod takes off ... you could always go back and add new animations or characters with you newfound millions in funding from some major publisher =)

<br /><br />Thanks for adding that bit of info.. on a side note for others reading.. the entity itself can also follow the origin bone I believe.. So the animator can actually have it move around their modelling program without having to reposition the entire bone structure on export.. This is extremely nice when having a npc interact with the environment..  or just for walking animations even..

<br /><br />Ok, personally I see animating/exporting weaponsmodels and character/enemy models as two seperate things. (not all might agree) 
<br /><br />I would start with the weapons, because they are generally speaking a little bit easier to understand, have less animations (usually only between 5 and 10 different anims) and will teach you the basics for animating for Doom3. The animations itself are quite selfexplanetory. You create bones, attach the bones to the model and animate those bones using keyframes or frame to frame animation. Then, if you position one bone in a certain way part of the model will move accordingly, etc..etc..
<br /><br />What kind of stuff/plugins you'll be using for this depends on which 3d program you use. So, before we can help we'll need to know is which 3d program you're using. Don't expect us to do any animating for you (unless you can find someone crazy enough to do it for you. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225023057im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> ) 
<br /><br />The main goal is to teach you how to do it yourself, so you can help others out in the future.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225023057im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p93812" date="Posted: Thu May 12, 2005 11:41 am "><author>Rayne</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">HI, a little and quick question... Since i'm working on a new Beretta gun in Lightwave, I'm really scared by the MD5 exporters situation for this program. As far as I can remember, only the Bozo exporter is available at the moment, but it only supports 1 material declaration per model.. Pratically useless, since a weapon contains at least 2 materials (character's arms material, gun materials etc..)
<br /><br /><br />So, I'm really scared by the fact that I've got to switch to another 3D app only to animate my models...
<br /><br /><br />Ps: Blender it's the only free 3d app with md5 scripts that I can remember.. But it's the only 3D app that scares the hell out of me when I launch it and the layout pops up in front of me..ugh

<br /><br />You don't need to, since it's an entity you can just call the sound from the animation def. An example:

<br /><br />snd_fly is then just a sounddecls you can define anywhere as soundshader.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p95592" date="Posted: Sun May 22, 2005 10:22 pm "><author>Oneofthe8devilz</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">You don't need to, since it's an entity you can just call the sound from the animation def.

<br /><br />That's how I solved the problem:
<br /><br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">model f16_jet {<br />   mesh      models/chris_md5/f16_jet.md5mesh   <br />   anim f16flyby   models/chris_md5/f16_jet.md5anim {<br />   frame 1      sound f16_jet_engine<br />   }<br />}<br /><br />entityDef f16_jet {      <br />      "inherit"   "func_animate"<br />      "model"      "f16_jet"<br />}</div>
<br /><br />"f16_jet_engine" is a looped soundshader that starts to play at frame 1 and gets played by the origin bone by default.... you can also define in the entity which bone shall play the sound.........

I know of Maya and Max being able to do this. If Lightwave can do it then animate in that. The main thing to know is that anything you want to have animation on needs to be animated with bones. Nothing can be animated inside Doom3 with the old Quake3 method of blend verts.
<br /><br />So if you wanted to have the crossbow shoot an arrow, the string needs to be animated with bones, so does the arrow and the hand pulling the trigger and whatever else.
<br /><br />Within Max, the way der_ton's exporter work everything has to be a single mesh. You can't have the arrow a seperate mesh and soforth. Then it just has to be skinned and weighted on the bones you provide to animate each part. The exporter also allow you to use whatever tool is to your disposal like IK or constraints or directly animating it. All this is also possible from within Maya accept for the export to be a longer process and I don't think you have to have a single mesh.

It's not very "game" friendly though because it generates a bone per vertex which ends up being way too much.
<br /><br />The bottom line is that bones is the one and only method to animate in Doom3. Of course the scripted animation is possible on "solid" objects with simple translation and rotation that can be done, no "vertex level" animation like for characters.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p93813" date="Posted: Thu May 12, 2005 11:03 am "><author>BloodRayne</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Rayne wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Ps: Blender it's the only free 3d app with md5 scripts that I can remember..

Nothing can be animated inside Doom3 with the old Quake3 method of blend verts.&#13;<br /><br />So if you wanted to have the crossbow shoot an arrow, the string needs to be animated with bones, so does the arrow and the hand pulling the trigger and whatever else.&#13;<br /><br />Within Max, the way der_ton's exporter work everything has to be a single mesh. You can't have the arrow a seperate mesh and soforth. Then it just has to be skinned and weighted on the bones you provide to animate each part. The exporter also allow you to use whatever tool is to your disposal like IK or constraints or directly animating it. All this is also possible from within Maya accept for the export to be a longer process and I don't think you have to have a single mesh.

<br /><ul><li>BloodRayne - Weapons Animation Advice</li><li>crimity</li><li>der_ton - Technical Advisor</li></ul>Tentative Members:<br /><ul><li>Johnny B. Goode</li><li>fault_line</li></ul>On a side note: <span style="font-weight: bold">We need more animators and <span style="text-decoration: underline">I know they're out there</span></span>. This idea (and some mods as well) will stand or fall with finding animators capable of spending time on this. I myself am really *really* busy but I feel it's important to contribute to this <span style="font-weight: bold">so I will step up myself as the first member</span>, but not as teamleader. I have knowledge and some experience in animating weapons and I would like to share whatever I know with the modding community.<br /><br />So, if you can animate for Doom3 or if you are an animator for a modteam currently working on a mod then I would like to ask you to join the Animators Think Tank that will help out the entire modding community and hopefully prevent more mods from having to stop due to the lack of Animators currently available for Doom3.<br /><br />Mod teams can ask the Animators Think Tank (or ATT in short) for help, with only a few conditions in return: <br /><ul><li>The mod team has read and tried the several tutorials available to them. (will be made available in this thread/post).<br /></li><li>The mod team tries to learn as much as possible from this help in order to learn the animation part as soon as possible so they can carry on the work for the mod themselves. <br /></li><li>Help can consist of making example animations and scenes for the current 3d packages available. The Animators Think Tank is *not* a quick way to have some people animate stuff for your mod, it should be a great step forward into learning animation and should offer you real tangeable help in the form of example scenes with the models of the mod in question.<br /></li><li>The mod team asking for help is working for an established mod, has a working, finished, model that needs to be animated and have a website with screenshots to prove it.<br /></li><li>If a future animator succesfully learns from the mod team then he/she offers his/her services to the Think Tank so we can help others out as well.</li></ul></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74330" date="Posted: Wed Jan 26, 2005 9:22 pm "><author>doomkid3000</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">this is a good thread we should sticky this for animators helping out i think when they setup there models for animation they should rig them with IK's so they can be animated with ease <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74343" date="Posted: Wed Jan 26, 2005 10:28 pm "><author>rich_is_bored</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Sticky like the inside of Pee Wee's pants. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74401" date="Posted: Thu Jan 27, 2005 3:03 am "><author>Johnny B.

<br /><br />Maybe the best way to get the best "bang-for-buck" is to make it a condition that mod makers can only ask the ATT for a tutorial to be written for an specific area (but not for a specific mod or specific model).

<br /><br />Well, when you have a million other things that need to be done, it is hard to also try to learn modeling....  I have learned to animate, but will not have enough free time for quite a while to learn to model any thing decent <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />  I just have far too many other things I am responsible for <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74556" date="Posted: Thu Jan 27, 2005 5:03 pm "><author>pbmax</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">understood.
<br /><br />it seems like if a total conversion team can't find an animator, they quit. if a tc team can't find one, then the lead person should scale back the scope of the mod and then take the time to learn the basics of animating. isn't that better then trashing everything?
<br /><br />imo, all these tc's that are quitting start off with a project that's too ambitious.
<br /><br />just my opinion. sorry to get off topic...</div>]]></body></post><post id="p74886" date="Posted: Sat Jan 29, 2005 9:29 am "><author>BloodRayne</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Johnny B.

<br /><br />This thread shouldn't get off topic, TC's mean a great big bunch of work and animation is one of the toughest things to work on in the mod. It's the most time consuming and trying part of making TC's, let's leave it at that. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74895" date="Posted: Sat Jan 29, 2005 10:32 am "><author>doomkid3000</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">i would love a video tuturial on lipsynching animating in DOOM3 man that would rock we need that though <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74939" date="Posted: Sat Jan 29, 2005 3:21 pm "><author>Cody64</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">No, there are many modellers and modellng tutorials available via Google, much more so that animation tuts.

						<div class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold">Welcome to the Animators Think Tank!</span>
<br />With some mods being forced to stop in part due to a lack of animators and with the extreme shortage of real animators in the Doom3 community We have started a think tank of animators offering their help to established mod teams in need of animation help.
<br /><br />The team members are:
<br /><ul><li>BloodRayne - Weapons Animation Advice</li><li>crimity</li><li>der_ton - Technical Advisor</li></ul>Tentative Members:<br /><ul><li>Johnny B. Goode</li><li>fault_line</li></ul>On a side note: <span style="font-weight: bold">We need more animators and <span style="text-decoration: underline">I know they're out there</span></span>. This idea (and some mods as well) will stand or fall with finding animators capable of spending time on this. I myself am really *really* busy but I feel it's important to contribute to this <span style="font-weight: bold">so I will step up myself as the first member</span>, but not as teamleader. I have knowledge and some experience in animating weapons and I would like to share whatever I know with the modding community.<br /><br />So, if you can animate for Doom3 or if you are an animator for a modteam currently working on a mod then I would like to ask you to join the Animators Think Tank that will help out the entire modding community and hopefully prevent more mods from having to stop due to the lack of Animators currently available for Doom3.<br /><br />Mod teams can ask the Animators Think Tank (or ATT in short) for help, with only a few conditions in return: <br /><ul><li>The mod team has read and tried the several tutorials available to them. (will be made available in this thread/post).<br /></li><li>The mod team tries to learn as much as possible from this help in order to learn the animation part as soon as possible so they can carry on the work for the mod themselves. <br /></li><li>Help can consist of making example animations and scenes for the current 3d packages available. The Animators Think Tank is *not* a quick way to have some people animate stuff for your mod, it should be a great step forward into learning animation and should offer you real tangeable help in the form of example scenes with the models of the mod in question.<br /></li><li>The mod team asking for help is working for an established mod, has a working, finished, model that needs to be animated and have a website with screenshots to prove it.<br /></li><li>If a future animator succesfully learns from the mod team then he/she offers his/her services to the Think Tank so we can help others out as well.</li></ul></div>

						<div class="postbody">understood.
<br /><br />it seems like if a total conversion team can't find an animator, they quit. if a tc team can't find one, then the lead person should scale back the scope of the mod and then take the time to learn the basics of animating. isn't that better then trashing everything?
<br /><br />imo, all these tc's that are quitting start off with a project that's too ambitious.
<br /><br />just my opinion. sorry to get off topic...</div>

Goode</li><li>fault_line</li></ul>On a side note: <span style="font-weight: bold">We need more animators and <span style="text-decoration: underline">I know they're out there</span></span>. This idea (and some mods as well) will stand or fall with finding animators capable of spending time on this. I myself am really *really* busy but I feel it's important to contribute to this <span style="font-weight: bold">so I will step up myself as the first member</span>, but not as teamleader. I have knowledge and some experience in animating weapons and I would like to share whatever I know with the modding community.<br /><br />So, if you can animate for Doom3 or if you are an animator for a modteam currently working on a mod then I would like to ask you to join the Animators Think Tank that will help out the entire modding community and hopefully prevent more mods from having to stop due to the lack of Animators currently available for Doom3.<br /><br />Mod teams can ask the Animators Think Tank (or ATT in short) for help, with only a few conditions in return: <br /><ul><li>The mod team has read and tried the several tutorials available to them. (will be made available in this thread/post).<br /></li><li>The mod team tries to learn as much as possible from this help in order to learn the animation part as soon as possible so they can carry on the work for the mod themselves. <br /></li><li>Help can consist of making example animations and scenes for the current 3d packages available.

						<div class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold">Welcome to the Animators Think Tank!</span>&#13;<br />With some mods being forced to stop in part due to a lack of animators and with the extreme shortage of real animators in the Doom3 community We have started a think tank of animators offering their help to established mod teams in need of animation help.&#13;<br /><br />The team members are:&#13;<br /><ul><li>BloodRayne - Weapons Animation Advice</li><li>crimity</li><li>der_ton - Technical Advisor</li></ul>Tentative Members:<br /><ul><li>Johnny B. Goode</li><li>fault_line</li></ul>On a side note: <span style="font-weight: bold">We need more animators and <span style="text-decoration: underline">I know they're out there</span></span>. This idea (and some mods as well) will stand or fall with finding animators capable of spending time on this. I myself am really *really* busy but I feel it's important to contribute to this <span style="font-weight: bold">so I will step up myself as the first member</span>, but not as teamleader. I have knowledge and some experience in animating weapons and I would like to share whatever I know with the modding community.<br /><br />So, if you can animate for Doom3 or if you are an animator for a modteam currently working on a mod then I would like to ask you to join the Animators Think Tank that will help out the entire modding community and hopefully prevent more mods from having to stop due to the lack of Animators currently available for Doom3.<br /><br />Mod teams can ask the Animators Think Tank (or ATT in short) for help, with only a few conditions in return: <br /><ul><li>The mod team has read and tried the several tutorials available to them. (will be made available in this thread/post).<br /></li><li>The mod team tries to learn as much as possible from this help in order to learn the animation part as soon as possible so they can carry on the work for the mod themselves. <br /></li><li>Help can consist of making example animations and scenes for the current 3d packages available. The Animators Think Tank is *not* a quick way to have some people animate stuff for your mod, it should be a great step forward into learning animation and should offer you real tangeable help in the form of example scenes with the models of the mod in question.<br /></li><li>The mod team asking for help is working for an established mod, has a working, finished, model that needs to be animated and have a website with screenshots to prove it.<br /></li><li>If a future animator succesfully learns from the mod team then he/she offers his/her services to the Think Tank so we can help others out as well.</li></ul></div>

The Animators Think Tank is *not* a quick way to have some people animate stuff for your mod, it should be a great step forward into learning animation and should offer you real tangeable help in the form of example scenes with the models of the mod in question.<br /></div>&#13;<br /><br />Maybe the best way to get the best "bang-for-buck" is to make it a condition that mod makers can only ask the ATT for a tutorial to be written for an specific area (but not for a specific mod or specific model). That way general information any mod maker can use is produced.</div>

<br />With some mods being forced to stop in part due to a lack of animators and with the extreme shortage of real animators in the Doom3 community We have started a think tank of animators offering their help to established mod teams in need of animation help.
<br /><br />The team members are:
<br /><ul><li>BloodRayne - Weapons Animation Advice</li><li>crimity</li><li>der_ton - Technical Advisor</li></ul>Tentative Members:<br /><ul><li>Johnny B. Goode</li><li>fault_line</li></ul>On a side note: <span style="font-weight: bold">We need more animators and <span style="text-decoration: underline">I know they're out there</span></span>. This idea (and some mods as well) will stand or fall with finding animators capable of spending time on this. I myself am really *really* busy but I feel it's important to contribute to this <span style="font-weight: bold">so I will step up myself as the first member</span>, but not as teamleader. I have knowledge and some experience in animating weapons and I would like to share whatever I know with the modding community.<br /><br />So, if you can animate for Doom3 or if you are an animator for a modteam currently working on a mod then I would like to ask you to join the Animators Think Tank that will help out the entire modding community and hopefully prevent more mods from having to stop due to the lack of Animators currently available for Doom3.<br /><br />Mod teams can ask the Animators Think Tank (or ATT in short) for help, with only a few conditions in return: <br /><ul><li>The mod team has read and tried the several tutorials available to them. (will be made available in this thread/post).<br /></li><li>The mod team tries to learn as much as possible from this help in order to learn the animation part as soon as possible so they can carry on the work for the mod themselves. <br /></li><li>Help can consist of making example animations and scenes for the current 3d packages available. The Animators Think Tank is *not* a quick way to have some people animate stuff for your mod, it should be a great step forward into learning animation and should offer you real tangeable help in the form of example scenes with the models of the mod in question.<br /></li><li>The mod team asking for help is working for an established mod, has a working, finished, model that needs to be animated and have a website with screenshots to prove it.<br /></li><li>If a future animator succesfully learns from the mod team then he/she offers his/her services to the Think Tank so we can help others out as well.</li></ul></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74330" date="Posted: Wed Jan 26, 2005 9:22 pm "><author>doomkid3000</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">this is a good thread we should sticky this for animators helping out i think when they setup there models for animation they should rig them with IK's so they can be animated with ease <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74343" date="Posted: Wed Jan 26, 2005 10:28 pm "><author>rich_is_bored</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Sticky like the inside of Pee Wee's pants. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74401" date="Posted: Thu Jan 27, 2005 3:03 am "><author>Johnny B.

<br /><br />Maybe the best way to get the best "bang-for-buck" is to make it a condition that mod makers can only ask the ATT for a tutorial to be written for an specific area (but not for a specific mod or specific model).

<br /><br />Well, when you have a million other things that need to be done, it is hard to also try to learn modeling....  I have learned to animate, but will not have enough free time for quite a while to learn to model any thing decent <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />  I just have far too many other things I am responsible for <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74556" date="Posted: Thu Jan 27, 2005 5:03 pm "><author>pbmax</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">understood.
<br /><br />it seems like if a total conversion team can't find an animator, they quit. if a tc team can't find one, then the lead person should scale back the scope of the mod and then take the time to learn the basics of animating. isn't that better then trashing everything?
<br /><br />imo, all these tc's that are quitting start off with a project that's too ambitious.
<br /><br />just my opinion. sorry to get off topic...</div>]]></body></post><post id="p74886" date="Posted: Sat Jan 29, 2005 9:29 am "><author>BloodRayne</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Johnny B.

<br /><br />This thread shouldn't get off topic, TC's mean a great big bunch of work and animation is one of the toughest things to work on in the mod.

						<div class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold">Welcome to the Animators Think Tank!</span>
<br />With some mods being forced to stop in part due to a lack of animators and with the extreme shortage of real animators in the Doom3 community We have started a think tank of animators offering their help to established mod teams in need of animation help.
<br /><br />The team members are:
<br /><ul><li>BloodRayne - Weapons Animation Advice</li><li>crimity</li><li>der_ton - Technical Advisor</li></ul>Tentative Members:<br /><ul><li>Johnny B. Goode</li><li>fault_line</li></ul>On a side note: <span style="font-weight: bold">We need more animators and <span style="text-decoration: underline">I know they're out there</span></span>. This idea (and some mods as well) will stand or fall with finding animators capable of spending time on this. I myself am really *really* busy but I feel it's important to contribute to this <span style="font-weight: bold">so I will step up myself as the first member</span>, but not as teamleader. I have knowledge and some experience in animating weapons and I would like to share whatever I know with the modding community.<br /><br />So, if you can animate for Doom3 or if you are an animator for a modteam currently working on a mod then I would like to ask you to join the Animators Think Tank that will help out the entire modding community and hopefully prevent more mods from having to stop due to the lack of Animators currently available for Doom3.<br /><br />Mod teams can ask the Animators Think Tank (or ATT in short) for help, with only a few conditions in return: <br /><ul><li>The mod team has read and tried the several tutorials available to them. (will be made available in this thread/post).<br /></li><li>The mod team tries to learn as much as possible from this help in order to learn the animation part as soon as possible so they can carry on the work for the mod themselves. <br /></li><li>Help can consist of making example animations and scenes for the current 3d packages available. The Animators Think Tank is *not* a quick way to have some people animate stuff for your mod, it should be a great step forward into learning animation and should offer you real tangeable help in the form of example scenes with the models of the mod in question.<br /></li><li>The mod team asking for help is working for an established mod, has a working, finished, model that needs to be animated and have a website with screenshots to prove it.<br /></li><li>If a future animator succesfully learns from the mod team then he/she offers his/her services to the Think Tank so we can help others out as well.</li></ul></div>

						<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">BloodRayne wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />1 - The mod team tries to learn as much as possible from this help in order to learn the animation part as soon as possible so they can carry on the work for the mod themselves. <br /><br />2 - Help can consist of making example animations and scenes for the current 3d packages available. The Animators Think Tank is *not* a quick way to have some people animate stuff for your mod, it should be a great step forward into learning animation and should offer you real tangeable help in the form of example scenes with the models of the mod in question.<br /></div>
<br /><br />Maybe the best way to get the best "bang-for-buck" is to make it a condition that mod makers can only ask the ATT for a tutorial to be written for an specific area (but not for a specific mod or specific model). That way general information any mod maker can use is produced.</div>

						<div class="postbody">understood.
<br /><br />it seems like if a total conversion team can't find an animator, they quit. if a tc team can't find one, then the lead person should scale back the scope of the mod and then take the time to learn the basics of animating. isn't that better then trashing everything?
<br /><br />imo, all these tc's that are quitting start off with a project that's too ambitious.
<br /><br />just my opinion. sorry to get off topic...</div>

<br /><br />This thread shouldn't get off topic, TC's mean a great big bunch of work and animation is one of the toughest things to work on in the mod.

<br />With some mods being forced to stop in part due to a lack of animators and with the extreme shortage of real animators in the Doom3 community We have started a think tank of animators offering their help to established mod teams in need of animation help.
<br /><br />The team members are:
<br /><ul><li>BloodRayne - Weapons Animation Advice</li><li>crimity</li><li>der_ton - Technical Advisor</li></ul>Tentative Members:<br /><ul><li>Johnny B. Goode</li><li>fault_line</li></ul>On a side note: <span style="font-weight: bold">We need more animators and <span style="text-decoration: underline">I know they're out there</span></span>. This idea (and some mods as well) will stand or fall with finding animators capable of spending time on this. I myself am really *really* busy but I feel it's important to contribute to this <span style="font-weight: bold">so I will step up myself as the first member</span>, but not as teamleader. I have knowledge and some experience in animating weapons and I would like to share whatever I know with the modding community.<br /><br />So, if you can animate for Doom3 or if you are an animator for a modteam currently working on a mod then I would like to ask you to join the Animators Think Tank that will help out the entire modding community and hopefully prevent more mods from having to stop due to the lack of Animators currently available for Doom3.<br /><br />Mod teams can ask the Animators Think Tank (or ATT in short) for help, with only a few conditions in return: <br /><ul><li>The mod team has read and tried the several tutorials available to them. (will be made available in this thread/post).<br /></li><li>The mod team tries to learn as much as possible from this help in order to learn the animation part as soon as possible so they can carry on the work for the mod themselves. <br /></li><li>Help can consist of making example animations and scenes for the current 3d packages available. The Animators Think Tank is *not* a quick way to have some people animate stuff for your mod, it should be a great step forward into learning animation and should offer you real tangeable help in the form of example scenes with the models of the mod in question.<br /></li><li>The mod team asking for help is working for an established mod, has a working, finished, model that needs to be animated and have a website with screenshots to prove it.<br /></li><li>If a future animator succesfully learns from the mod team then he/she offers his/her services to the Think Tank so we can help others out as well.</li></ul></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74330" date="Posted: Wed Jan 26, 2005 9:22 pm "><author>doomkid3000</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">this is a good thread we should sticky this for animators helping out i think when they setup there models for animation they should rig them with IK's so they can be animated with ease <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74343" date="Posted: Wed Jan 26, 2005 10:28 pm "><author>rich_is_bored</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Sticky like the inside of Pee Wee's pants. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74401" date="Posted: Thu Jan 27, 2005 3:03 am "><author>Johnny B.

<br /><br />Maybe the best way to get the best "bang-for-buck" is to make it a condition that mod makers can only ask the ATT for a tutorial to be written for an specific area (but not for a specific mod or specific model). That way general information any mod maker can use is produced.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p74418" date="Posted: Thu Jan 27, 2005 5:35 am "><author>Cody64</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Maybe we can do something like this...but for models.....

<br /><br />Well, when you have a million other things that need to be done, it is hard to also try to learn modeling....  I have learned to animate, but will not have enough free time for quite a while to learn to model any thing decent <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />  I just have far too many other things I am responsible for <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74556" date="Posted: Thu Jan 27, 2005 5:03 pm "><author>pbmax</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">understood.
<br /><br />it seems like if a total conversion team can't find an animator, they quit. if a tc team can't find one, then the lead person should scale back the scope of the mod and then take the time to learn the basics of animating. isn't that better then trashing everything?

						<div class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold">Welcome to the Animators Think Tank!</span>
<br />With some mods being forced to stop in part due to a lack of animators and with the extreme shortage of real animators in the Doom3 community We have started a think tank of animators offering their help to established mod teams in need of animation help.
<br /><br />The team members are:
<br /><ul><li>BloodRayne - Weapons Animation Advice</li><li>crimity</li><li>der_ton - Technical Advisor</li></ul>Tentative Members:<br /><ul><li>Johnny B. Goode</li><li>fault_line</li></ul>On a side note: <span style="font-weight: bold">We need more animators and <span style="text-decoration: underline">I know they're out there</span></span>. This idea (and some mods as well) will stand or fall with finding animators capable of spending time on this. I myself am really *really* busy but I feel it's important to contribute to this <span style="font-weight: bold">so I will step up myself as the first member</span>, but not as teamleader. I have knowledge and some experience in animating weapons and I would like to share whatever I know with the modding community.<br /><br />So, if you can animate for Doom3 or if you are an animator for a modteam currently working on a mod then I would like to ask you to join the Animators Think Tank that will help out the entire modding community and hopefully prevent more mods from having to stop due to the lack of Animators currently available for Doom3.<br /><br />Mod teams can ask the Animators Think Tank (or ATT in short) for help, with only a few conditions in return: <br /><ul><li>The mod team has read and tried the several tutorials available to them. (will be made available in this thread/post).<br /></li><li>The mod team tries to learn as much as possible from this help in order to learn the animation part as soon as possible so they can carry on the work for the mod themselves. <br /></li><li>Help can consist of making example animations and scenes for the current 3d packages available. The Animators Think Tank is *not* a quick way to have some people animate stuff for your mod, it should be a great step forward into learning animation and should offer you real tangeable help in the form of example scenes with the models of the mod in question.<br /></li><li>The mod team asking for help is working for an established mod, has a working, finished, model that needs to be animated and have a website with screenshots to prove it.<br /></li><li>If a future animator succesfully learns from the mod team then he/she offers his/her services to the Think Tank so we can help others out as well.</li></ul></div>

						<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">BloodRayne wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />1 - The mod team tries to learn as much as possible from this help in order to learn the animation part as soon as possible so they can carry on the work for the mod themselves. <br /><br />2 - Help can consist of making example animations and scenes for the current 3d packages available. The Animators Think Tank is *not* a quick way to have some people animate stuff for your mod, it should be a great step forward into learning animation and should offer you real tangeable help in the form of example scenes with the models of the mod in question.<br /></div>
<br /><br />Maybe the best way to get the best "bang-for-buck" is to make it a condition that mod makers can only ask the ATT for a tutorial to be written for an specific area (but not for a specific mod or specific model). That way general information any mod maker can use is produced.</div>

						<div class="postbody">understood.
<br /><br />it seems like if a total conversion team can't find an animator, they quit. if a tc team can't find one, then the lead person should scale back the scope of the mod and then take the time to learn the basics of animating. isn't that better then trashing everything?
<br /><br />imo, all these tc's that are quitting start off with a project that's too ambitious.
<br /><br />just my opinion. sorry to get off topic...</div>

<br /><br />This thread shouldn't get off topic, TC's mean a great big bunch of work and animation is one of the toughest things to work on in the mod.

Goode</li><li>fault_line</li></ul>On a side note: <span style="font-weight: bold">We need more animators and <span style="text-decoration: underline">I know they're out there</span></span>. This idea (and some mods as well) will stand or fall with finding animators capable of spending time on this. I myself am really *really* busy but I feel it's important to contribute to this <span style="font-weight: bold">so I will step up myself as the first member</span>, but not as teamleader. I have knowledge and some experience in animating weapons and I would like to share whatever I know with the modding community.<br /><br />So, if you can animate for Doom3 or if you are an animator for a modteam currently working on a mod then I would like to ask you to join the Animators Think Tank that will help out the entire modding community and hopefully prevent more mods from having to stop due to the lack of Animators currently available for Doom3.<br /><br />Mod teams can ask the Animators Think Tank (or ATT in short) for help, with only a few conditions in return: <br /><ul><li>The mod team has read and tried the several tutorials available to them. (will be made available in this thread/post).<br /></li><li>The mod team tries to learn as much as possible from this help in order to learn the animation part as soon as possible so they can carry on the work for the mod themselves. <br /></li><li>Help can consist of making example animations and scenes for the current 3d packages available. The Animators Think Tank is *not* a quick way to have some people animate stuff for your mod, it should be a great step forward into learning animation and should offer you real tangeable help in the form of example scenes with the models of the mod in question.<br /></li><li>The mod team asking for help is working for an established mod, has a working, finished, model that needs to be animated and have a website with screenshots to prove it.<br /></li><li>If a future animator succesfully learns from the mod team then he/she offers his/her services to the Think Tank so we can help others out as well.</li></ul></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74330" date="Posted: Wed Jan 26, 2005 9:22 pm "><author>doomkid3000</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">this is a good thread we should sticky this for animators helping out i think when they setup there models for animation they should rig them with IK's so they can be animated with ease <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74343" date="Posted: Wed Jan 26, 2005 10:28 pm "><author>rich_is_bored</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Sticky like the inside of Pee Wee's pants. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74401" date="Posted: Thu Jan 27, 2005 3:03 am "><author>Johnny B.

<br />With some mods being forced to stop in part due to a lack of animators and with the extreme shortage of real animators in the Doom3 community We have started a think tank of animators offering their help to established mod teams in need of animation help.
<br /><br />The team members are:
<br /><ul><li>BloodRayne - Weapons Animation Advice</li><li>crimity</li><li>der_ton - Technical Advisor</li></ul>Tentative Members:<br /><ul><li>Johnny B. Goode</li><li>fault_line</li></ul>On a side note: <span style="font-weight: bold">We need more animators and <span style="text-decoration: underline">I know they're out there</span></span>. This idea (and some mods as well) will stand or fall with finding animators capable of spending time on this. I myself am really *really* busy but I feel it's important to contribute to this <span style="font-weight: bold">so I will step up myself as the first member</span>, but not as teamleader. I have knowledge and some experience in animating weapons and I would like to share whatever I know with the modding community.<br /><br />So, if you can animate for Doom3 or if you are an animator for a modteam currently working on a mod then I would like to ask you to join the Animators Think Tank that will help out the entire modding community and hopefully prevent more mods from having to stop due to the lack of Animators currently available for Doom3.<br /><br />Mod teams can ask the Animators Think Tank (or ATT in short) for help, with only a few conditions in return: <br /><ul><li>The mod team has read and tried the several tutorials available to them. (will be made available in this thread/post).<br /></li><li>The mod team tries to learn as much as possible from this help in order to learn the animation part as soon as possible so they can carry on the work for the mod themselves. <br /></li><li>Help can consist of making example animations and scenes for the current 3d packages available. The Animators Think Tank is *not* a quick way to have some people animate stuff for your mod, it should be a great step forward into learning animation and should offer you real tangeable help in the form of example scenes with the models of the mod in question.<br /></li><li>The mod team asking for help is working for an established mod, has a working, finished, model that needs to be animated and have a website with screenshots to prove it.<br /></li><li>If a future animator succesfully learns from the mod team then he/she offers his/her services to the Think Tank so we can help others out as well.</li></ul></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74330" date="Posted: Wed Jan 26, 2005 9:22 pm "><author>doomkid3000</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">this is a good thread we should sticky this for animators helping out i think when they setup there models for animation they should rig them with IK's so they can be animated with ease <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74343" date="Posted: Wed Jan 26, 2005 10:28 pm "><author>rich_is_bored</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Sticky like the inside of Pee Wee's pants. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74401" date="Posted: Thu Jan 27, 2005 3:03 am "><author>Johnny B.

<br /><br />Maybe the best way to get the best "bang-for-buck" is to make it a condition that mod makers can only ask the ATT for a tutorial to be written for an specific area (but not for a specific mod or specific model).

<br /><br />Well, when you have a million other things that need to be done, it is hard to also try to learn modeling....  I have learned to animate, but will not have enough free time for quite a while to learn to model any thing decent <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />  I just have far too many other things I am responsible for <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74556" date="Posted: Thu Jan 27, 2005 5:03 pm "><author>pbmax</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">understood.
<br /><br />it seems like if a total conversion team can't find an animator, they quit. if a tc team can't find one, then the lead person should scale back the scope of the mod and then take the time to learn the basics of animating. isn't that better then trashing everything?
<br /><br />imo, all these tc's that are quitting start off with a project that's too ambitious.
<br /><br />just my opinion. sorry to get off topic...</div>]]></body></post><post id="p74886" date="Posted: Sat Jan 29, 2005 9:29 am "><author>BloodRayne</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Johnny B.

						<div class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold">Welcome to the Animators Think Tank!</span>
<br />With some mods being forced to stop in part due to a lack of animators and with the extreme shortage of real animators in the Doom3 community We have started a think tank of animators offering their help to established mod teams in need of animation help.
<br /><br />The team members are:
<br /><ul><li>BloodRayne - Weapons Animation Advice</li><li>crimity</li><li>der_ton - Technical Advisor</li></ul>Tentative Members:<br /><ul><li>Johnny B. Goode</li><li>fault_line</li></ul>On a side note: <span style="font-weight: bold">We need more animators and <span style="text-decoration: underline">I know they're out there</span></span>. This idea (and some mods as well) will stand or fall with finding animators capable of spending time on this. I myself am really *really* busy but I feel it's important to contribute to this <span style="font-weight: bold">so I will step up myself as the first member</span>, but not as teamleader. I have knowledge and some experience in animating weapons and I would like to share whatever I know with the modding community.<br /><br />So, if you can animate for Doom3 or if you are an animator for a modteam currently working on a mod then I would like to ask you to join the Animators Think Tank that will help out the entire modding community and hopefully prevent more mods from having to stop due to the lack of Animators currently available for Doom3.<br /><br />Mod teams can ask the Animators Think Tank (or ATT in short) for help, with only a few conditions in return: <br /><ul><li>The mod team has read and tried the several tutorials available to them. (will be made available in this thread/post).<br /></li><li>The mod team tries to learn as much as possible from this help in order to learn the animation part as soon as possible so they can carry on the work for the mod themselves. <br /></li><li>Help can consist of making example animations and scenes for the current 3d packages available. The Animators Think Tank is *not* a quick way to have some people animate stuff for your mod, it should be a great step forward into learning animation and should offer you real tangeable help in the form of example scenes with the models of the mod in question.<br /></li><li>The mod team asking for help is working for an established mod, has a working, finished, model that needs to be animated and have a website with screenshots to prove it.<br /></li><li>If a future animator succesfully learns from the mod team then he/she offers his/her services to the Think Tank so we can help others out as well.</li></ul></div>

<br /><br />it seems like if a total conversion team can't find an animator, they quit. if a tc team can't find one, then the lead person should scale back the scope of the mod and then take the time to learn the basics of animating. isn't that better then trashing everything?
<br /><br />imo, all these tc's that are quitting start off with a project that's too ambitious.
<br /><br />just my opinion. sorry to get off topic...</div>

<br />With some mods being forced to stop in part due to a lack of animators and with the extreme shortage of real animators in the Doom3 community We have started a think tank of animators offering their help to established mod teams in need of animation help.
<br /><br />The team members are:
<br /><ul><li>BloodRayne - Weapons Animation Advice</li><li>crimity</li><li>der_ton - Technical Advisor</li></ul>Tentative Members:<br /><ul><li>Johnny B. Goode</li><li>fault_line</li></ul>On a side note: <span style="font-weight: bold">We need more animators and <span style="text-decoration: underline">I know they're out there</span></span>. This idea (and some mods as well) will stand or fall with finding animators capable of spending time on this. I myself am really *really* busy but I feel it's important to contribute to this <span style="font-weight: bold">so I will step up myself as the first member</span>, but not as teamleader. I have knowledge and some experience in animating weapons and I would like to share whatever I know with the modding community.<br /><br />So, if you can animate for Doom3 or if you are an animator for a modteam currently working on a mod then I would like to ask you to join the Animators Think Tank that will help out the entire modding community and hopefully prevent more mods from having to stop due to the lack of Animators currently available for Doom3.<br /><br />Mod teams can ask the Animators Think Tank (or ATT in short) for help, with only a few conditions in return: <br /><ul><li>The mod team has read and tried the several tutorials available to them. (will be made available in this thread/post).<br /></li><li>The mod team tries to learn as much as possible from this help in order to learn the animation part as soon as possible so they can carry on the work for the mod themselves. <br /></li><li>Help can consist of making example animations and scenes for the current 3d packages available. The Animators Think Tank is *not* a quick way to have some people animate stuff for your mod, it should be a great step forward into learning animation and should offer you real tangeable help in the form of example scenes with the models of the mod in question.<br /></li><li>The mod team asking for help is working for an established mod, has a working, finished, model that needs to be animated and have a website with screenshots to prove it.<br /></li><li>If a future animator succesfully learns from the mod team then he/she offers his/her services to the Think Tank so we can help others out as well.</li></ul></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74330" date="Posted: Wed Jan 26, 2005 9:22 pm "><author>doomkid3000</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">this is a good thread we should sticky this for animators helping out i think when they setup there models for animation they should rig them with IK's so they can be animated with ease <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74343" date="Posted: Wed Jan 26, 2005 10:28 pm "><author>rich_is_bored</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Sticky like the inside of Pee Wee's pants. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74401" date="Posted: Thu Jan 27, 2005 3:03 am "><author>Johnny B.

<br /><br />Maybe the best way to get the best "bang-for-buck" is to make it a condition that mod makers can only ask the ATT for a tutorial to be written for an specific area (but not for a specific mod or specific model).

<br /><br />Well, when you have a million other things that need to be done, it is hard to also try to learn modeling....  I have learned to animate, but will not have enough free time for quite a while to learn to model any thing decent <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />  I just have far too many other things I am responsible for <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74556" date="Posted: Thu Jan 27, 2005 5:03 pm "><author>pbmax</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">understood.
<br /><br />it seems like if a total conversion team can't find an animator, they quit. if a tc team can't find one, then the lead person should scale back the scope of the mod and then take the time to learn the basics of animating. isn't that better then trashing everything?
<br /><br />imo, all these tc's that are quitting start off with a project that's too ambitious.
<br /><br />just my opinion. sorry to get off topic...</div>]]></body></post><post id="p74886" date="Posted: Sat Jan 29, 2005 9:29 am "><author>BloodRayne</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Johnny B.

<br /><br />This thread shouldn't get off topic, TC's mean a great big bunch of work and animation is one of the toughest things to work on in the mod. It's the most time consuming and trying part of making TC's, let's leave it at that. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74895" date="Posted: Sat Jan 29, 2005 10:32 am "><author>doomkid3000</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">i would love a video tuturial on lipsynching animating in DOOM3 man that would rock we need that though <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74939" date="Posted: Sat Jan 29, 2005 3:21 pm "><author>Cody64</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">No, there are many modellers and modellng tutorials available via Google, much more so that animation tuts.

						<div class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold">Welcome to the Animators Think Tank!</span>
<br />With some mods being forced to stop in part due to a lack of animators and with the extreme shortage of real animators in the Doom3 community We have started a think tank of animators offering their help to established mod teams in need of animation help.
<br /><br />The team members are:
<br /><ul><li>BloodRayne - Weapons Animation Advice</li><li>crimity</li><li>der_ton - Technical Advisor</li></ul>Tentative Members:<br /><ul><li>Johnny B. Goode</li><li>fault_line</li></ul>On a side note: <span style="font-weight: bold">We need more animators and <span style="text-decoration: underline">I know they're out there</span></span>. This idea (and some mods as well) will stand or fall with finding animators capable of spending time on this. I myself am really *really* busy but I feel it's important to contribute to this <span style="font-weight: bold">so I will step up myself as the first member</span>, but not as teamleader. I have knowledge and some experience in animating weapons and I would like to share whatever I know with the modding community.<br /><br />So, if you can animate for Doom3 or if you are an animator for a modteam currently working on a mod then I would like to ask you to join the Animators Think Tank that will help out the entire modding community and hopefully prevent more mods from having to stop due to the lack of Animators currently available for Doom3.<br /><br />Mod teams can ask the Animators Think Tank (or ATT in short) for help, with only a few conditions in return: <br /><ul><li>The mod team has read and tried the several tutorials available to them. (will be made available in this thread/post).<br /></li><li>The mod team tries to learn as much as possible from this help in order to learn the animation part as soon as possible so they can carry on the work for the mod themselves. <br /></li><li>Help can consist of making example animations and scenes for the current 3d packages available. The Animators Think Tank is *not* a quick way to have some people animate stuff for your mod, it should be a great step forward into learning animation and should offer you real tangeable help in the form of example scenes with the models of the mod in question.<br /></li><li>The mod team asking for help is working for an established mod, has a working, finished, model that needs to be animated and have a website with screenshots to prove it.<br /></li><li>If a future animator succesfully learns from the mod team then he/she offers his/her services to the Think Tank so we can help others out as well.</li></ul></div>

						<div class="postbody">understood.
<br /><br />it seems like if a total conversion team can't find an animator, they quit. if a tc team can't find one, then the lead person should scale back the scope of the mod and then take the time to learn the basics of animating. isn't that better then trashing everything?
<br /><br />imo, all these tc's that are quitting start off with a project that's too ambitious.
<br /><br />just my opinion. sorry to get off topic...</div>

<br />With some mods being forced to stop in part due to a lack of animators and with the extreme shortage of real animators in the Doom3 community We have started a think tank of animators offering their help to established mod teams in need of animation help.
<br /><br />The team members are:
<br /><ul><li>BloodRayne - Weapons Animation Advice</li><li>crimity</li><li>der_ton - Technical Advisor</li></ul>Tentative Members:<br /><ul><li>Johnny B. Goode</li><li>fault_line</li></ul>On a side note: <span style="font-weight: bold">We need more animators and <span style="text-decoration: underline">I know they're out there</span></span>. This idea (and some mods as well) will stand or fall with finding animators capable of spending time on this. I myself am really *really* busy but I feel it's important to contribute to this <span style="font-weight: bold">so I will step up myself as the first member</span>, but not as teamleader. I have knowledge and some experience in animating weapons and I would like to share whatever I know with the modding community.<br /><br />So, if you can animate for Doom3 or if you are an animator for a modteam currently working on a mod then I would like to ask you to join the Animators Think Tank that will help out the entire modding community and hopefully prevent more mods from having to stop due to the lack of Animators currently available for Doom3.<br /><br />Mod teams can ask the Animators Think Tank (or ATT in short) for help, with only a few conditions in return: <br /><ul><li>The mod team has read and tried the several tutorials available to them. (will be made available in this thread/post).<br /></li><li>The mod team tries to learn as much as possible from this help in order to learn the animation part as soon as possible so they can carry on the work for the mod themselves. <br /></li><li>Help can consist of making example animations and scenes for the current 3d packages available.

<br /><br />Maybe the best way to get the best "bang-for-buck" is to make it a condition that mod makers can only ask the ATT for a tutorial to be written for an specific area (but not for a specific mod or specific model).

<br /><br />Well, when you have a million other things that need to be done, it is hard to also try to learn modeling....  I have learned to animate, but will not have enough free time for quite a while to learn to model any thing decent <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />  I just have far too many other things I am responsible for <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74556" date="Posted: Thu Jan 27, 2005 5:03 pm "><author>pbmax</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">understood.
<br /><br />it seems like if a total conversion team can't find an animator, they quit. if a tc team can't find one, then the lead person should scale back the scope of the mod and then take the time to learn the basics of animating. isn't that better then trashing everything?
<br /><br />imo, all these tc's that are quitting start off with a project that's too ambitious.
<br /><br />just my opinion. sorry to get off topic...</div>]]></body></post><post id="p74886" date="Posted: Sat Jan 29, 2005 9:29 am "><author>BloodRayne</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Johnny B.

<br /><br />This thread shouldn't get off topic, TC's mean a great big bunch of work and animation is one of the toughest things to work on in the mod.

						<div class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold">Welcome to the Animators Think Tank!</span>
<br />With some mods being forced to stop in part due to a lack of animators and with the extreme shortage of real animators in the Doom3 community We have started a think tank of animators offering their help to established mod teams in need of animation help.
<br /><br />The team members are:
<br /><ul><li>BloodRayne - Weapons Animation Advice</li><li>crimity</li><li>der_ton - Technical Advisor</li></ul>Tentative Members:<br /><ul><li>Johnny B. Goode</li><li>fault_line</li></ul>On a side note: <span style="font-weight: bold">We need more animators and <span style="text-decoration: underline">I know they're out there</span></span>. This idea (and some mods as well) will stand or fall with finding animators capable of spending time on this. I myself am really *really* busy but I feel it's important to contribute to this <span style="font-weight: bold">so I will step up myself as the first member</span>, but not as teamleader. I have knowledge and some experience in animating weapons and I would like to share whatever I know with the modding community.<br /><br />So, if you can animate for Doom3 or if you are an animator for a modteam currently working on a mod then I would like to ask you to join the Animators Think Tank that will help out the entire modding community and hopefully prevent more mods from having to stop due to the lack of Animators currently available for Doom3.<br /><br />Mod teams can ask the Animators Think Tank (or ATT in short) for help, with only a few conditions in return: <br /><ul><li>The mod team has read and tried the several tutorials available to them. (will be made available in this thread/post).<br /></li><li>The mod team tries to learn as much as possible from this help in order to learn the animation part as soon as possible so they can carry on the work for the mod themselves. <br /></li><li>Help can consist of making example animations and scenes for the current 3d packages available. The Animators Think Tank is *not* a quick way to have some people animate stuff for your mod, it should be a great step forward into learning animation and should offer you real tangeable help in the form of example scenes with the models of the mod in question.<br /></li><li>The mod team asking for help is working for an established mod, has a working, finished, model that needs to be animated and have a website with screenshots to prove it.<br /></li><li>If a future animator succesfully learns from the mod team then he/she offers his/her services to the Think Tank so we can help others out as well.</li></ul></div>

<br /><br />Maybe the best way to get the best "bang-for-buck" is to make it a condition that mod makers can only ask the ATT for a tutorial to be written for an specific area (but not for a specific mod or specific model). That way general information any mod maker can use is produced.</div>

<br /><br />it seems like if a total conversion team can't find an animator, they quit. if a tc team can't find one, then the lead person should scale back the scope of the mod and then take the time to learn the basics of animating. isn't that better then trashing everything?
<br /><br />imo, all these tc's that are quitting start off with a project that's too ambitious.

<br /><br />This thread shouldn't get off topic, TC's mean a great big bunch of work and animation is one of the toughest things to work on in the mod.

<br />With some mods being forced to stop in part due to a lack of animators and with the extreme shortage of real animators in the Doom3 community We have started a think tank of animators offering their help to established mod teams in need of animation help.
<br /><br />The team members are:
<br /><ul><li>BloodRayne - Weapons Animation Advice</li><li>crimity</li><li>der_ton - Technical Advisor</li></ul>Tentative Members:<br /><ul><li>Johnny B. Goode</li><li>fault_line</li></ul>On a side note: <span style="font-weight: bold">We need more animators and <span style="text-decoration: underline">I know they're out there</span></span>. This idea (and some mods as well) will stand or fall with finding animators capable of spending time on this. I myself am really *really* busy but I feel it's important to contribute to this <span style="font-weight: bold">so I will step up myself as the first member</span>, but not as teamleader. I have knowledge and some experience in animating weapons and I would like to share whatever I know with the modding community.<br /><br />So, if you can animate for Doom3 or if you are an animator for a modteam currently working on a mod then I would like to ask you to join the Animators Think Tank that will help out the entire modding community and hopefully prevent more mods from having to stop due to the lack of Animators currently available for Doom3.<br /><br />Mod teams can ask the Animators Think Tank (or ATT in short) for help, with only a few conditions in return: <br /><ul><li>The mod team has read and tried the several tutorials available to them. (will be made available in this thread/post).<br /></li><li>The mod team tries to learn as much as possible from this help in order to learn the animation part as soon as possible so they can carry on the work for the mod themselves. <br /></li><li>Help can consist of making example animations and scenes for the current 3d packages available. The Animators Think Tank is *not* a quick way to have some people animate stuff for your mod, it should be a great step forward into learning animation and should offer you real tangeable help in the form of example scenes with the models of the mod in question.<br /></li><li>The mod team asking for help is working for an established mod, has a working, finished, model that needs to be animated and have a website with screenshots to prove it.<br /></li><li>If a future animator succesfully learns from the mod team then he/she offers his/her services to the Think Tank so we can help others out as well.</li></ul></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74330" date="Posted: Wed Jan 26, 2005 9:22 pm "><author>doomkid3000</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">this is a good thread we should sticky this for animators helping out i think when they setup there models for animation they should rig them with IK's so they can be animated with ease <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74343" date="Posted: Wed Jan 26, 2005 10:28 pm "><author>rich_is_bored</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Sticky like the inside of Pee Wee's pants. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74401" date="Posted: Thu Jan 27, 2005 3:03 am "><author>Johnny B.

<br /><br />Well, when you have a million other things that need to be done, it is hard to also try to learn modeling....  I have learned to animate, but will not have enough free time for quite a while to learn to model any thing decent <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />  I just have far too many other things I am responsible for <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74556" date="Posted: Thu Jan 27, 2005 5:03 pm "><author>pbmax</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">understood.
<br /><br />it seems like if a total conversion team can't find an animator, they quit. if a tc team can't find one, then the lead person should scale back the scope of the mod and then take the time to learn the basics of animating. isn't that better then trashing everything?
<br /><br />imo, all these tc's that are quitting start off with a project that's too ambitious.
<br /><br />just my opinion. sorry to get off topic...</div>]]></body></post><post id="p74886" date="Posted: Sat Jan 29, 2005 9:29 am "><author>BloodRayne</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Johnny B.

<br /><br />This thread shouldn't get off topic, TC's mean a great big bunch of work and animation is one of the toughest things to work on in the mod. It's the most time consuming and trying part of making TC's, let's leave it at that. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74895" date="Posted: Sat Jan 29, 2005 10:32 am "><author>doomkid3000</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">i would love a video tuturial on lipsynching animating in DOOM3 man that would rock we need that though <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74939" date="Posted: Sat Jan 29, 2005 3:21 pm "><author>Cody64</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">No, there are many modellers and modellng tutorials available via Google, much more so that animation tuts.

						<div class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold">Welcome to the Animators Think Tank!</span>
<br />With some mods being forced to stop in part due to a lack of animators and with the extreme shortage of real animators in the Doom3 community We have started a think tank of animators offering their help to established mod teams in need of animation help.
<br /><br />The team members are:
<br /><ul><li>BloodRayne - Weapons Animation Advice</li><li>crimity</li><li>der_ton - Technical Advisor</li></ul>Tentative Members:<br /><ul><li>Johnny B. Goode</li><li>fault_line</li></ul>On a side note: <span style="font-weight: bold">We need more animators and <span style="text-decoration: underline">I know they're out there</span></span>. This idea (and some mods as well) will stand or fall with finding animators capable of spending time on this. I myself am really *really* busy but I feel it's important to contribute to this <span style="font-weight: bold">so I will step up myself as the first member</span>, but not as teamleader. I have knowledge and some experience in animating weapons and I would like to share whatever I know with the modding community.<br /><br />So, if you can animate for Doom3 or if you are an animator for a modteam currently working on a mod then I would like to ask you to join the Animators Think Tank that will help out the entire modding community and hopefully prevent more mods from having to stop due to the lack of Animators currently available for Doom3.<br /><br />Mod teams can ask the Animators Think Tank (or ATT in short) for help, with only a few conditions in return: <br /><ul><li>The mod team has read and tried the several tutorials available to them. (will be made available in this thread/post).<br /></li><li>The mod team tries to learn as much as possible from this help in order to learn the animation part as soon as possible so they can carry on the work for the mod themselves. <br /></li><li>Help can consist of making example animations and scenes for the current 3d packages available. The Animators Think Tank is *not* a quick way to have some people animate stuff for your mod, it should be a great step forward into learning animation and should offer you real tangeable help in the form of example scenes with the models of the mod in question.<br /></li><li>The mod team asking for help is working for an established mod, has a working, finished, model that needs to be animated and have a website with screenshots to prove it.<br /></li><li>If a future animator succesfully learns from the mod team then he/she offers his/her services to the Think Tank so we can help others out as well.</li></ul></div>

						<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">BloodRayne wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />1 - The mod team tries to learn as much as possible from this help in order to learn the animation part as soon as possible so they can carry on the work for the mod themselves. <br /><br />2 - Help can consist of making example animations and scenes for the current 3d packages available. The Animators Think Tank is *not* a quick way to have some people animate stuff for your mod, it should be a great step forward into learning animation and should offer you real tangeable help in the form of example scenes with the models of the mod in question.<br /></div>
<br /><br />Maybe the best way to get the best "bang-for-buck" is to make it a condition that mod makers can only ask the ATT for a tutorial to be written for an specific area (but not for a specific mod or specific model). That way general information any mod maker can use is produced.</div>

						<div class="postbody">understood.
<br /><br />it seems like if a total conversion team can't find an animator, they quit. if a tc team can't find one, then the lead person should scale back the scope of the mod and then take the time to learn the basics of animating. isn't that better then trashing everything?
<br /><br />imo, all these tc's that are quitting start off with a project that's too ambitious.
<br /><br />just my opinion. sorry to get off topic...</div>

Goode</li><li>fault_line</li></ul>On a side note: <span style="font-weight: bold">We need more animators and <span style="text-decoration: underline">I know they're out there</span></span>. This idea (and some mods as well) will stand or fall with finding animators capable of spending time on this. I myself am really *really* busy but I feel it's important to contribute to this <span style="font-weight: bold">so I will step up myself as the first member</span>, but not as teamleader. I have knowledge and some experience in animating weapons and I would like to share whatever I know with the modding community.<br /><br />So, if you can animate for Doom3 or if you are an animator for a modteam currently working on a mod then I would like to ask you to join the Animators Think Tank that will help out the entire modding community and hopefully prevent more mods from having to stop due to the lack of Animators currently available for Doom3.<br /><br />Mod teams can ask the Animators Think Tank (or ATT in short) for help, with only a few conditions in return: <br /><ul><li>The mod team has read and tried the several tutorials available to them. (will be made available in this thread/post).<br /></li><li>The mod team tries to learn as much as possible from this help in order to learn the animation part as soon as possible so they can carry on the work for the mod themselves. <br /></li><li>Help can consist of making example animations and scenes for the current 3d packages available. The Animators Think Tank is *not* a quick way to have some people animate stuff for your mod, it should be a great step forward into learning animation and should offer you real tangeable help in the form of example scenes with the models of the mod in question.<br /></li><li>The mod team asking for help is working for an established mod, has a working, finished, model that needs to be animated and have a website with screenshots to prove it.<br /></li><li>If a future animator succesfully learns from the mod team then he/she offers his/her services to the Think Tank so we can help others out as well.</li></ul></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74330" date="Posted: Wed Jan 26, 2005 9:22 pm "><author>doomkid3000</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">this is a good thread we should sticky this for animators helping out i think when they setup there models for animation they should rig them with IK's so they can be animated with ease <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74343" date="Posted: Wed Jan 26, 2005 10:28 pm "><author>rich_is_bored</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Sticky like the inside of Pee Wee's pants. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74401" date="Posted: Thu Jan 27, 2005 3:03 am "><author>Johnny B.

						<div class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold">Welcome to the Animators Think Tank!</span>&#13;<br />With some mods being forced to stop in part due to a lack of animators and with the extreme shortage of real animators in the Doom3 community We have started a think tank of animators offering their help to established mod teams in need of animation help.&#13;<br /><br />The team members are:&#13;<br /><ul><li>BloodRayne - Weapons Animation Advice</li><li>crimity</li><li>der_ton - Technical Advisor</li></ul>Tentative Members:<br /><ul><li>Johnny B. Goode</li><li>fault_line</li></ul>On a side note: <span style="font-weight: bold">We need more animators and <span style="text-decoration: underline">I know they're out there</span></span>. This idea (and some mods as well) will stand or fall with finding animators capable of spending time on this. I myself am really *really* busy but I feel it's important to contribute to this <span style="font-weight: bold">so I will step up myself as the first member</span>, but not as teamleader. I have knowledge and some experience in animating weapons and I would like to share whatever I know with the modding community.<br /><br />So, if you can animate for Doom3 or if you are an animator for a modteam currently working on a mod then I would like to ask you to join the Animators Think Tank that will help out the entire modding community and hopefully prevent more mods from having to stop due to the lack of Animators currently available for Doom3.<br /><br />Mod teams can ask the Animators Think Tank (or ATT in short) for help, with only a few conditions in return: <br /><ul><li>The mod team has read and tried the several tutorials available to them. (will be made available in this thread/post).<br /></li><li>The mod team tries to learn as much as possible from this help in order to learn the animation part as soon as possible so they can carry on the work for the mod themselves. <br /></li><li>Help can consist of making example animations and scenes for the current 3d packages available. The Animators Think Tank is *not* a quick way to have some people animate stuff for your mod, it should be a great step forward into learning animation and should offer you real tangeable help in the form of example scenes with the models of the mod in question.<br /></li><li>The mod team asking for help is working for an established mod, has a working, finished, model that needs to be animated and have a website with screenshots to prove it.<br /></li><li>If a future animator succesfully learns from the mod team then he/she offers his/her services to the Think Tank so we can help others out as well.</li></ul></div>

The Animators Think Tank is *not* a quick way to have some people animate stuff for your mod, it should be a great step forward into learning animation and should offer you real tangeable help in the form of example scenes with the models of the mod in question.<br /></div>&#13;<br /><br />Maybe the best way to get the best "bang-for-buck" is to make it a condition that mod makers can only ask the ATT for a tutorial to be written for an specific area (but not for a specific mod or specific model). That way general information any mod maker can use is produced.</div>

<br />With some mods being forced to stop in part due to a lack of animators and with the extreme shortage of real animators in the Doom3 community We have started a think tank of animators offering their help to established mod teams in need of animation help.
<br /><br />The team members are:
<br /><ul><li>BloodRayne - Weapons Animation Advice</li><li>crimity</li><li>der_ton - Technical Advisor</li></ul>Tentative Members:<br /><ul><li>Johnny B. Goode</li><li>fault_line</li></ul>On a side note: <span style="font-weight: bold">We need more animators and <span style="text-decoration: underline">I know they're out there</span></span>. This idea (and some mods as well) will stand or fall with finding animators capable of spending time on this. I myself am really *really* busy but I feel it's important to contribute to this <span style="font-weight: bold">so I will step up myself as the first member</span>, but not as teamleader. I have knowledge and some experience in animating weapons and I would like to share whatever I know with the modding community.<br /><br />So, if you can animate for Doom3 or if you are an animator for a modteam currently working on a mod then I would like to ask you to join the Animators Think Tank that will help out the entire modding community and hopefully prevent more mods from having to stop due to the lack of Animators currently available for Doom3.<br /><br />Mod teams can ask the Animators Think Tank (or ATT in short) for help, with only a few conditions in return: <br /><ul><li>The mod team has read and tried the several tutorials available to them. (will be made available in this thread/post).<br /></li><li>The mod team tries to learn as much as possible from this help in order to learn the animation part as soon as possible so they can carry on the work for the mod themselves. <br /></li><li>Help can consist of making example animations and scenes for the current 3d packages available. The Animators Think Tank is *not* a quick way to have some people animate stuff for your mod, it should be a great step forward into learning animation and should offer you real tangeable help in the form of example scenes with the models of the mod in question.<br /></li><li>The mod team asking for help is working for an established mod, has a working, finished, model that needs to be animated and have a website with screenshots to prove it.<br /></li><li>If a future animator succesfully learns from the mod team then he/she offers his/her services to the Think Tank so we can help others out as well.</li></ul></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74330" date="Posted: Wed Jan 26, 2005 9:22 pm "><author>doomkid3000</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">this is a good thread we should sticky this for animators helping out i think when they setup there models for animation they should rig them with IK's so they can be animated with ease <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74343" date="Posted: Wed Jan 26, 2005 10:28 pm "><author>rich_is_bored</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Sticky like the inside of Pee Wee's pants. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74401" date="Posted: Thu Jan 27, 2005 3:03 am "><author>Johnny B.

<br /><br />Maybe the best way to get the best "bang-for-buck" is to make it a condition that mod makers can only ask the ATT for a tutorial to be written for an specific area (but not for a specific mod or specific model).

<br /><br />Well, when you have a million other things that need to be done, it is hard to also try to learn modeling....  I have learned to animate, but will not have enough free time for quite a while to learn to model any thing decent <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />  I just have far too many other things I am responsible for <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74556" date="Posted: Thu Jan 27, 2005 5:03 pm "><author>pbmax</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">understood.
<br /><br />it seems like if a total conversion team can't find an animator, they quit. if a tc team can't find one, then the lead person should scale back the scope of the mod and then take the time to learn the basics of animating. isn't that better then trashing everything?
<br /><br />imo, all these tc's that are quitting start off with a project that's too ambitious.

						<div class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold">Welcome to the Animators Think Tank!</span>
<br />With some mods being forced to stop in part due to a lack of animators and with the extreme shortage of real animators in the Doom3 community We have started a think tank of animators offering their help to established mod teams in need of animation help.
<br /><br />The team members are:
<br /><ul><li>BloodRayne - Weapons Animation Advice</li><li>crimity</li><li>der_ton - Technical Advisor</li></ul>Tentative Members:<br /><ul><li>Johnny B. Goode</li><li>fault_line</li></ul>On a side note: <span style="font-weight: bold">We need more animators and <span style="text-decoration: underline">I know they're out there</span></span>. This idea (and some mods as well) will stand or fall with finding animators capable of spending time on this. I myself am really *really* busy but I feel it's important to contribute to this <span style="font-weight: bold">so I will step up myself as the first member</span>, but not as teamleader. I have knowledge and some experience in animating weapons and I would like to share whatever I know with the modding community.<br /><br />So, if you can animate for Doom3 or if you are an animator for a modteam currently working on a mod then I would like to ask you to join the Animators Think Tank that will help out the entire modding community and hopefully prevent more mods from having to stop due to the lack of Animators currently available for Doom3.<br /><br />Mod teams can ask the Animators Think Tank (or ATT in short) for help, with only a few conditions in return: <br /><ul><li>The mod team has read and tried the several tutorials available to them. (will be made available in this thread/post).<br /></li><li>The mod team tries to learn as much as possible from this help in order to learn the animation part as soon as possible so they can carry on the work for the mod themselves. <br /></li><li>Help can consist of making example animations and scenes for the current 3d packages available. The Animators Think Tank is *not* a quick way to have some people animate stuff for your mod, it should be a great step forward into learning animation and should offer you real tangeable help in the form of example scenes with the models of the mod in question.<br /></li><li>The mod team asking for help is working for an established mod, has a working, finished, model that needs to be animated and have a website with screenshots to prove it.<br /></li><li>If a future animator succesfully learns from the mod team then he/she offers his/her services to the Think Tank so we can help others out as well.</li></ul></div>

						<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">BloodRayne wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />1 - The mod team tries to learn as much as possible from this help in order to learn the animation part as soon as possible so they can carry on the work for the mod themselves. <br /><br />2 - Help can consist of making example animations and scenes for the current 3d packages available. The Animators Think Tank is *not* a quick way to have some people animate stuff for your mod, it should be a great step forward into learning animation and should offer you real tangeable help in the form of example scenes with the models of the mod in question.<br /></div>
<br /><br />Maybe the best way to get the best "bang-for-buck" is to make it a condition that mod makers can only ask the ATT for a tutorial to be written for an specific area (but not for a specific mod or specific model). That way general information any mod maker can use is produced.</div>

						<div class="postbody">understood.
<br /><br />it seems like if a total conversion team can't find an animator, they quit. if a tc team can't find one, then the lead person should scale back the scope of the mod and then take the time to learn the basics of animating. isn't that better then trashing everything?
<br /><br />imo, all these tc's that are quitting start off with a project that's too ambitious.
<br /><br />just my opinion. sorry to get off topic...</div>

<br />With some mods being forced to stop in part due to a lack of animators and with the extreme shortage of real animators in the Doom3 community We have started a think tank of animators offering their help to established mod teams in need of animation help.
<br /><br />The team members are:
<br /><ul><li>BloodRayne - Weapons Animation Advice</li><li>crimity</li><li>der_ton - Technical Advisor</li></ul>Tentative Members:<br /><ul><li>Johnny B. Goode</li><li>fault_line</li></ul>On a side note: <span style="font-weight: bold">We need more animators and <span style="text-decoration: underline">I know they're out there</span></span>. This idea (and some mods as well) will stand or fall with finding animators capable of spending time on this. I myself am really *really* busy but I feel it's important to contribute to this <span style="font-weight: bold">so I will step up myself as the first member</span>, but not as teamleader. I have knowledge and some experience in animating weapons and I would like to share whatever I know with the modding community.<br /><br />So, if you can animate for Doom3 or if you are an animator for a modteam currently working on a mod then I would like to ask you to join the Animators Think Tank that will help out the entire modding community and hopefully prevent more mods from having to stop due to the lack of Animators currently available for Doom3.<br /><br />Mod teams can ask the Animators Think Tank (or ATT in short) for help, with only a few conditions in return: <br /><ul><li>The mod team has read and tried the several tutorials available to them. (will be made available in this thread/post).<br /></li><li>The mod team tries to learn as much as possible from this help in order to learn the animation part as soon as possible so they can carry on the work for the mod themselves. <br /></li><li>Help can consist of making example animations and scenes for the current 3d packages available. The Animators Think Tank is *not* a quick way to have some people animate stuff for your mod, it should be a great step forward into learning animation and should offer you real tangeable help in the form of example scenes with the models of the mod in question.<br /></li><li>The mod team asking for help is working for an established mod, has a working, finished, model that needs to be animated and have a website with screenshots to prove it.<br /></li><li>If a future animator succesfully learns from the mod team then he/she offers his/her services to the Think Tank so we can help others out as well.</li></ul></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74330" date="Posted: Wed Jan 26, 2005 9:22 pm "><author>doomkid3000</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">this is a good thread we should sticky this for animators helping out i think when they setup there models for animation they should rig them with IK's so they can be animated with ease <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74343" date="Posted: Wed Jan 26, 2005 10:28 pm "><author>rich_is_bored</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Sticky like the inside of Pee Wee's pants. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74401" date="Posted: Thu Jan 27, 2005 3:03 am "><author>Johnny B.

<br /><br />Well, when you have a million other things that need to be done, it is hard to also try to learn modeling....  I have learned to animate, but will not have enough free time for quite a while to learn to model any thing decent <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />  I just have far too many other things I am responsible for <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74556" date="Posted: Thu Jan 27, 2005 5:03 pm "><author>pbmax</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">understood.
<br /><br />it seems like if a total conversion team can't find an animator, they quit. if a tc team can't find one, then the lead person should scale back the scope of the mod and then take the time to learn the basics of animating. isn't that better then trashing everything?
<br /><br />imo, all these tc's that are quitting start off with a project that's too ambitious.
<br /><br />just my opinion. sorry to get off topic...</div>]]></body></post><post id="p74886" date="Posted: Sat Jan 29, 2005 9:29 am "><author>BloodRayne</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Johnny B.

<br /><br />This thread shouldn't get off topic, TC's mean a great big bunch of work and animation is one of the toughest things to work on in the mod.

						<div class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold">Welcome to the Animators Think Tank!</span>
<br />With some mods being forced to stop in part due to a lack of animators and with the extreme shortage of real animators in the Doom3 community We have started a think tank of animators offering their help to established mod teams in need of animation help.
<br /><br />The team members are:
<br /><ul><li>BloodRayne - Weapons Animation Advice</li><li>crimity</li><li>der_ton - Technical Advisor</li></ul>Tentative Members:<br /><ul><li>Johnny B. Goode</li><li>fault_line</li></ul>On a side note: <span style="font-weight: bold">We need more animators and <span style="text-decoration: underline">I know they're out there</span></span>. This idea (and some mods as well) will stand or fall with finding animators capable of spending time on this. I myself am really *really* busy but I feel it's important to contribute to this <span style="font-weight: bold">so I will step up myself as the first member</span>, but not as teamleader. I have knowledge and some experience in animating weapons and I would like to share whatever I know with the modding community.<br /><br />So, if you can animate for Doom3 or if you are an animator for a modteam currently working on a mod then I would like to ask you to join the Animators Think Tank that will help out the entire modding community and hopefully prevent more mods from having to stop due to the lack of Animators currently available for Doom3.<br /><br />Mod teams can ask the Animators Think Tank (or ATT in short) for help, with only a few conditions in return: <br /><ul><li>The mod team has read and tried the several tutorials available to them. (will be made available in this thread/post).<br /></li><li>The mod team tries to learn as much as possible from this help in order to learn the animation part as soon as possible so they can carry on the work for the mod themselves. <br /></li><li>Help can consist of making example animations and scenes for the current 3d packages available. The Animators Think Tank is *not* a quick way to have some people animate stuff for your mod, it should be a great step forward into learning animation and should offer you real tangeable help in the form of example scenes with the models of the mod in question.<br /></li><li>The mod team asking for help is working for an established mod, has a working, finished, model that needs to be animated and have a website with screenshots to prove it.<br /></li><li>If a future animator succesfully learns from the mod team then he/she offers his/her services to the Think Tank so we can help others out as well.</li></ul></div>

						<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">BloodRayne wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />1 - The mod team tries to learn as much as possible from this help in order to learn the animation part as soon as possible so they can carry on the work for the mod themselves. <br /><br />2 - Help can consist of making example animations and scenes for the current 3d packages available. The Animators Think Tank is *not* a quick way to have some people animate stuff for your mod, it should be a great step forward into learning animation and should offer you real tangeable help in the form of example scenes with the models of the mod in question.<br /></div>
<br /><br />Maybe the best way to get the best "bang-for-buck" is to make it a condition that mod makers can only ask the ATT for a tutorial to be written for an specific area (but not for a specific mod or specific model). That way general information any mod maker can use is produced.</div>

						<div class="postbody">understood.
<br /><br />it seems like if a total conversion team can't find an animator, they quit. if a tc team can't find one, then the lead person should scale back the scope of the mod and then take the time to learn the basics of animating. isn't that better then trashing everything?
<br /><br />imo, all these tc's that are quitting start off with a project that's too ambitious.
<br /><br />just my opinion. sorry to get off topic...</div>

Goode</li><li>fault_line</li></ul>On a side note: <span style="font-weight: bold">We need more animators and <span style="text-decoration: underline">I know they're out there</span></span>. This idea (and some mods as well) will stand or fall with finding animators capable of spending time on this. I myself am really *really* busy but I feel it's important to contribute to this <span style="font-weight: bold">so I will step up myself as the first member</span>, but not as teamleader. I have knowledge and some experience in animating weapons and I would like to share whatever I know with the modding community.<br /><br />So, if you can animate for Doom3 or if you are an animator for a modteam currently working on a mod then I would like to ask you to join the Animators Think Tank that will help out the entire modding community and hopefully prevent more mods from having to stop due to the lack of Animators currently available for Doom3.<br /><br />Mod teams can ask the Animators Think Tank (or ATT in short) for help, with only a few conditions in return: <br /><ul><li>The mod team has read and tried the several tutorials available to them. (will be made available in this thread/post).<br /></li><li>The mod team tries to learn as much as possible from this help in order to learn the animation part as soon as possible so they can carry on the work for the mod themselves. <br /></li><li>Help can consist of making example animations and scenes for the current 3d packages available. The Animators Think Tank is *not* a quick way to have some people animate stuff for your mod, it should be a great step forward into learning animation and should offer you real tangeable help in the form of example scenes with the models of the mod in question.<br /></li><li>The mod team asking for help is working for an established mod, has a working, finished, model that needs to be animated and have a website with screenshots to prove it.<br /></li><li>If a future animator succesfully learns from the mod team then he/she offers his/her services to the Think Tank so we can help others out as well.</li></ul></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74330" date="Posted: Wed Jan 26, 2005 9:22 pm "><author>doomkid3000</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">this is a good thread we should sticky this for animators helping out i think when they setup there models for animation they should rig them with IK's so they can be animated with ease <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74343" date="Posted: Wed Jan 26, 2005 10:28 pm "><author>rich_is_bored</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Sticky like the inside of Pee Wee's pants. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74401" date="Posted: Thu Jan 27, 2005 3:03 am "><author>Johnny B.

						<div class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold">Welcome to the Animators Think Tank!</span>&#13;<br />With some mods being forced to stop in part due to a lack of animators and with the extreme shortage of real animators in the Doom3 community We have started a think tank of animators offering their help to established mod teams in need of animation help.&#13;<br /><br />The team members are:&#13;<br /><ul><li>BloodRayne - Weapons Animation Advice</li><li>crimity</li><li>der_ton - Technical Advisor</li></ul>Tentative Members:<br /><ul><li>Johnny B. Goode</li><li>fault_line</li></ul>On a side note: <span style="font-weight: bold">We need more animators and <span style="text-decoration: underline">I know they're out there</span></span>. This idea (and some mods as well) will stand or fall with finding animators capable of spending time on this. I myself am really *really* busy but I feel it's important to contribute to this <span style="font-weight: bold">so I will step up myself as the first member</span>, but not as teamleader. I have knowledge and some experience in animating weapons and I would like to share whatever I know with the modding community.<br /><br />So, if you can animate for Doom3 or if you are an animator for a modteam currently working on a mod then I would like to ask you to join the Animators Think Tank that will help out the entire modding community and hopefully prevent more mods from having to stop due to the lack of Animators currently available for Doom3.<br /><br />Mod teams can ask the Animators Think Tank (or ATT in short) for help, with only a few conditions in return: <br /><ul><li>The mod team has read and tried the several tutorials available to them. (will be made available in this thread/post).<br /></li><li>The mod team tries to learn as much as possible from this help in order to learn the animation part as soon as possible so they can carry on the work for the mod themselves. <br /></li><li>Help can consist of making example animations and scenes for the current 3d packages available. The Animators Think Tank is *not* a quick way to have some people animate stuff for your mod, it should be a great step forward into learning animation and should offer you real tangeable help in the form of example scenes with the models of the mod in question.<br /></li><li>The mod team asking for help is working for an established mod, has a working, finished, model that needs to be animated and have a website with screenshots to prove it.<br /></li><li>If a future animator succesfully learns from the mod team then he/she offers his/her services to the Think Tank so we can help others out as well.</li></ul></div>

						<div class="postbody">understood.&#13;<br /><br />it seems like if a total conversion team can't find an animator, they quit. if a tc team can't find one, then the lead person should scale back the scope of the mod and then take the time to learn the basics of animating. isn't that better then trashing everything?&#13;<br /><br />imo, all these tc's that are quitting start off with a project that's too ambitious.&#13;<br /><br />just my opinion. sorry to get off topic...</div>

<br />With some mods being forced to stop in part due to a lack of animators and with the extreme shortage of real animators in the Doom3 community We have started a think tank of animators offering their help to established mod teams in need of animation help.
<br /><br />The team members are:
<br /><ul><li>BloodRayne - Weapons Animation Advice</li><li>crimity</li><li>der_ton - Technical Advisor</li></ul>Tentative Members:<br /><ul><li>Johnny B. Goode</li><li>fault_line</li></ul>On a side note: <span style="font-weight: bold">We need more animators and <span style="text-decoration: underline">I know they're out there</span></span>. This idea (and some mods as well) will stand or fall with finding animators capable of spending time on this. I myself am really *really* busy but I feel it's important to contribute to this <span style="font-weight: bold">so I will step up myself as the first member</span>, but not as teamleader. I have knowledge and some experience in animating weapons and I would like to share whatever I know with the modding community.<br /><br />So, if you can animate for Doom3 or if you are an animator for a modteam currently working on a mod then I would like to ask you to join the Animators Think Tank that will help out the entire modding community and hopefully prevent more mods from having to stop due to the lack of Animators currently available for Doom3.<br /><br />Mod teams can ask the Animators Think Tank (or ATT in short) for help, with only a few conditions in return: <br /><ul><li>The mod team has read and tried the several tutorials available to them. (will be made available in this thread/post).<br /></li><li>The mod team tries to learn as much as possible from this help in order to learn the animation part as soon as possible so they can carry on the work for the mod themselves. <br /></li><li>Help can consist of making example animations and scenes for the current 3d packages available. The Animators Think Tank is *not* a quick way to have some people animate stuff for your mod, it should be a great step forward into learning animation and should offer you real tangeable help in the form of example scenes with the models of the mod in question.<br /></li><li>The mod team asking for help is working for an established mod, has a working, finished, model that needs to be animated and have a website with screenshots to prove it.<br /></li><li>If a future animator succesfully learns from the mod team then he/she offers his/her services to the Think Tank so we can help others out as well.</li></ul></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74330" date="Posted: Wed Jan 26, 2005 9:22 pm "><author>doomkid3000</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">this is a good thread we should sticky this for animators helping out i think when they setup there models for animation they should rig them with IK's so they can be animated with ease <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74343" date="Posted: Wed Jan 26, 2005 10:28 pm "><author>rich_is_bored</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Sticky like the inside of Pee Wee's pants. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74401" date="Posted: Thu Jan 27, 2005 3:03 am "><author>Johnny B.

<br /><br />Well, when you have a million other things that need to be done, it is hard to also try to learn modeling....  I have learned to animate, but will not have enough free time for quite a while to learn to model any thing decent <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />  I just have far too many other things I am responsible for <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74556" date="Posted: Thu Jan 27, 2005 5:03 pm "><author>pbmax</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">understood.
<br /><br />it seems like if a total conversion team can't find an animator, they quit. if a tc team can't find one, then the lead person should scale back the scope of the mod and then take the time to learn the basics of animating. isn't that better then trashing everything?
<br /><br />imo, all these tc's that are quitting start off with a project that's too ambitious.
<br /><br />just my opinion. sorry to get off topic...</div>]]></body></post><post id="p74886" date="Posted: Sat Jan 29, 2005 9:29 am "><author>BloodRayne</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Johnny B.

<br /><br />This thread shouldn't get off topic, TC's mean a great big bunch of work and animation is one of the toughest things to work on in the mod. It's the most time consuming and trying part of making TC's, let's leave it at that. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74895" date="Posted: Sat Jan 29, 2005 10:32 am "><author>doomkid3000</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">i would love a video tuturial on lipsynching animating in DOOM3 man that would rock we need that though <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74939" date="Posted: Sat Jan 29, 2005 3:21 pm "><author>Cody64</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">No, there are many modellers and modellng tutorials available via Google, much more so that animation tuts.

						<div class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold">Welcome to the Animators Think Tank!</span>
<br />With some mods being forced to stop in part due to a lack of animators and with the extreme shortage of real animators in the Doom3 community We have started a think tank of animators offering their help to established mod teams in need of animation help.
<br /><br />The team members are:
<br /><ul><li>BloodRayne - Weapons Animation Advice</li><li>crimity</li><li>der_ton - Technical Advisor</li></ul>Tentative Members:<br /><ul><li>Johnny B. Goode</li><li>fault_line</li></ul>On a side note: <span style="font-weight: bold">We need more animators and <span style="text-decoration: underline">I know they're out there</span></span>. This idea (and some mods as well) will stand or fall with finding animators capable of spending time on this. I myself am really *really* busy but I feel it's important to contribute to this <span style="font-weight: bold">so I will step up myself as the first member</span>, but not as teamleader. I have knowledge and some experience in animating weapons and I would like to share whatever I know with the modding community.<br /><br />So, if you can animate for Doom3 or if you are an animator for a modteam currently working on a mod then I would like to ask you to join the Animators Think Tank that will help out the entire modding community and hopefully prevent more mods from having to stop due to the lack of Animators currently available for Doom3.<br /><br />Mod teams can ask the Animators Think Tank (or ATT in short) for help, with only a few conditions in return: <br /><ul><li>The mod team has read and tried the several tutorials available to them. (will be made available in this thread/post).<br /></li><li>The mod team tries to learn as much as possible from this help in order to learn the animation part as soon as possible so they can carry on the work for the mod themselves. <br /></li><li>Help can consist of making example animations and scenes for the current 3d packages available. The Animators Think Tank is *not* a quick way to have some people animate stuff for your mod, it should be a great step forward into learning animation and should offer you real tangeable help in the form of example scenes with the models of the mod in question.<br /></li><li>The mod team asking for help is working for an established mod, has a working, finished, model that needs to be animated and have a website with screenshots to prove it.<br /></li><li>If a future animator succesfully learns from the mod team then he/she offers his/her services to the Think Tank so we can help others out as well.</li></ul></div>

						<div class="postbody">understood.
<br /><br />it seems like if a total conversion team can't find an animator, they quit. if a tc team can't find one, then the lead person should scale back the scope of the mod and then take the time to learn the basics of animating. isn't that better then trashing everything?
<br /><br />imo, all these tc's that are quitting start off with a project that's too ambitious.
<br /><br />just my opinion. sorry to get off topic...</div>

<br />With some mods being forced to stop in part due to a lack of animators and with the extreme shortage of real animators in the Doom3 community We have started a think tank of animators offering their help to established mod teams in need of animation help.
<br /><br />The team members are:
<br /><ul><li>BloodRayne - Weapons Animation Advice</li><li>crimity</li><li>der_ton - Technical Advisor</li></ul>Tentative Members:<br /><ul><li>Johnny B. Goode</li><li>fault_line</li></ul>On a side note: <span style="font-weight: bold">We need more animators and <span style="text-decoration: underline">I know they're out there</span></span>. This idea (and some mods as well) will stand or fall with finding animators capable of spending time on this. I myself am really *really* busy but I feel it's important to contribute to this <span style="font-weight: bold">so I will step up myself as the first member</span>, but not as teamleader. I have knowledge and some experience in animating weapons and I would like to share whatever I know with the modding community.<br /><br />So, if you can animate for Doom3 or if you are an animator for a modteam currently working on a mod then I would like to ask you to join the Animators Think Tank that will help out the entire modding community and hopefully prevent more mods from having to stop due to the lack of Animators currently available for Doom3.<br /><br />Mod teams can ask the Animators Think Tank (or ATT in short) for help, with only a few conditions in return: <br /><ul><li>The mod team has read and tried the several tutorials available to them. (will be made available in this thread/post).<br /></li><li>The mod team tries to learn as much as possible from this help in order to learn the animation part as soon as possible so they can carry on the work for the mod themselves. <br /></li><li>Help can consist of making example animations and scenes for the current 3d packages available. The Animators Think Tank is *not* a quick way to have some people animate stuff for your mod, it should be a great step forward into learning animation and should offer you real tangeable help in the form of example scenes with the models of the mod in question.<br /></li><li>The mod team asking for help is working for an established mod, has a working, finished, model that needs to be animated and have a website with screenshots to prove it.<br /></li><li>If a future animator succesfully learns from the mod team then he/she offers his/her services to the Think Tank so we can help others out as well.</li></ul></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74330" date="Posted: Wed Jan 26, 2005 9:22 pm "><author>doomkid3000</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">this is a good thread we should sticky this for animators helping out i think when they setup there models for animation they should rig them with IK's so they can be animated with ease <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74343" date="Posted: Wed Jan 26, 2005 10:28 pm "><author>rich_is_bored</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Sticky like the inside of Pee Wee's pants. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74401" date="Posted: Thu Jan 27, 2005 3:03 am "><author>Johnny B.

<br /><br />Maybe the best way to get the best "bang-for-buck" is to make it a condition that mod makers can only ask the ATT for a tutorial to be written for an specific area (but not for a specific mod or specific model).

<br /><br />Well, when you have a million other things that need to be done, it is hard to also try to learn modeling....  I have learned to animate, but will not have enough free time for quite a while to learn to model any thing decent <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />  I just have far too many other things I am responsible for <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74556" date="Posted: Thu Jan 27, 2005 5:03 pm "><author>pbmax</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">understood.
<br /><br />it seems like if a total conversion team can't find an animator, they quit. if a tc team can't find one, then the lead person should scale back the scope of the mod and then take the time to learn the basics of animating. isn't that better then trashing everything?
<br /><br />imo, all these tc's that are quitting start off with a project that's too ambitious.
<br /><br />just my opinion. sorry to get off topic...</div>]]></body></post><post id="p74886" date="Posted: Sat Jan 29, 2005 9:29 am "><author>BloodRayne</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Johnny B.

<br /><br />This thread shouldn't get off topic, TC's mean a great big bunch of work and animation is one of the toughest things to work on in the mod.

						<div class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold">Welcome to the Animators Think Tank!</span>
<br />With some mods being forced to stop in part due to a lack of animators and with the extreme shortage of real animators in the Doom3 community We have started a think tank of animators offering their help to established mod teams in need of animation help.
<br /><br />The team members are:
<br /><ul><li>BloodRayne - Weapons Animation Advice</li><li>crimity</li><li>der_ton - Technical Advisor</li></ul>Tentative Members:<br /><ul><li>Johnny B. Goode</li><li>fault_line</li></ul>On a side note: <span style="font-weight: bold">We need more animators and <span style="text-decoration: underline">I know they're out there</span></span>. This idea (and some mods as well) will stand or fall with finding animators capable of spending time on this. I myself am really *really* busy but I feel it's important to contribute to this <span style="font-weight: bold">so I will step up myself as the first member</span>, but not as teamleader. I have knowledge and some experience in animating weapons and I would like to share whatever I know with the modding community.<br /><br />So, if you can animate for Doom3 or if you are an animator for a modteam currently working on a mod then I would like to ask you to join the Animators Think Tank that will help out the entire modding community and hopefully prevent more mods from having to stop due to the lack of Animators currently available for Doom3.<br /><br />Mod teams can ask the Animators Think Tank (or ATT in short) for help, with only a few conditions in return: <br /><ul><li>The mod team has read and tried the several tutorials available to them.

<br /><br />Maybe the best way to get the best "bang-for-buck" is to make it a condition that mod makers can only ask the ATT for a tutorial to be written for an specific area (but not for a specific mod or specific model). That way general information any mod maker can use is produced.</div>

						<div class="postbody">understood.
<br /><br />it seems like if a total conversion team can't find an animator, they quit. if a tc team can't find one, then the lead person should scale back the scope of the mod and then take the time to learn the basics of animating. isn't that better then trashing everything?
<br /><br />imo, all these tc's that are quitting start off with a project that's too ambitious.
<br /><br />just my opinion. sorry to get off topic...</div>

<br /><br />This thread shouldn't get off topic, TC's mean a great big bunch of work and animation is one of the toughest things to work on in the mod. It's the most time consuming and trying part of making TC's, let's leave it at that. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>

Goode</li><li>fault_line</li></ul>On a side note: <span style="font-weight: bold">We need more animators and <span style="text-decoration: underline">I know they're out there</span></span>. This idea (and some mods as well) will stand or fall with finding animators capable of spending time on this. I myself am really *really* busy but I feel it's important to contribute to this <span style="font-weight: bold">so I will step up myself as the first member</span>, but not as teamleader. I have knowledge and some experience in animating weapons and I would like to share whatever I know with the modding community.<br /><br />So, if you can animate for Doom3 or if you are an animator for a modteam currently working on a mod then I would like to ask you to join the Animators Think Tank that will help out the entire modding community and hopefully prevent more mods from having to stop due to the lack of Animators currently available for Doom3.<br /><br />Mod teams can ask the Animators Think Tank (or ATT in short) for help, with only a few conditions in return: <br /><ul><li>The mod team has read and tried the several tutorials available to them. (will be made available in this thread/post).<br /></li><li>The mod team tries to learn as much as possible from this help in order to learn the animation part as soon as possible so they can carry on the work for the mod themselves. <br /></li><li>Help can consist of making example animations and scenes for the current 3d packages available. The Animators Think Tank is *not* a quick way to have some people animate stuff for your mod, it should be a great step forward into learning animation and should offer you real tangeable help in the form of example scenes with the models of the mod in question.<br /></li><li>The mod team asking for help is working for an established mod, has a working, finished, model that needs to be animated and have a website with screenshots to prove it.<br /></li><li>If a future animator succesfully learns from the mod team then he/she offers his/her services to the Think Tank so we can help others out as well.</li></ul></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74330" date="Posted: Wed Jan 26, 2005 9:22 pm "><author>doomkid3000</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">this is a good thread we should sticky this for animators helping out i think when they setup there models for animation they should rig them with IK's so they can be animated with ease <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74343" date="Posted: Wed Jan 26, 2005 10:28 pm "><author>rich_is_bored</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Sticky like the inside of Pee Wee's pants. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74401" date="Posted: Thu Jan 27, 2005 3:03 am "><author>Johnny B.

						<div class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold">Welcome to the Animators Think Tank!</span>&#13;<br />With some mods being forced to stop in part due to a lack of animators and with the extreme shortage of real animators in the Doom3 community We have started a think tank of animators offering their help to established mod teams in need of animation help.&#13;<br /><br />The team members are:&#13;<br /><ul><li>BloodRayne - Weapons Animation Advice</li><li>crimity</li><li>der_ton - Technical Advisor</li></ul>Tentative Members:<br /><ul><li>Johnny B. Goode</li><li>fault_line</li></ul>On a side note: <span style="font-weight: bold">We need more animators and <span style="text-decoration: underline">I know they're out there</span></span>. This idea (and some mods as well) will stand or fall with finding animators capable of spending time on this. I myself am really *really* busy but I feel it's important to contribute to this <span style="font-weight: bold">so I will step up myself as the first member</span>, but not as teamleader. I have knowledge and some experience in animating weapons and I would like to share whatever I know with the modding community.<br /><br />So, if you can animate for Doom3 or if you are an animator for a modteam currently working on a mod then I would like to ask you to join the Animators Think Tank that will help out the entire modding community and hopefully prevent more mods from having to stop due to the lack of Animators currently available for Doom3.<br /><br />Mod teams can ask the Animators Think Tank (or ATT in short) for help, with only a few conditions in return: <br /><ul><li>The mod team has read and tried the several tutorials available to them. (will be made available in this thread/post).<br /></li><li>The mod team tries to learn as much as possible from this help in order to learn the animation part as soon as possible so they can carry on the work for the mod themselves. <br /></li><li>Help can consist of making example animations and scenes for the current 3d packages available. The Animators Think Tank is *not* a quick way to have some people animate stuff for your mod, it should be a great step forward into learning animation and should offer you real tangeable help in the form of example scenes with the models of the mod in question.<br /></li><li>The mod team asking for help is working for an established mod, has a working, finished, model that needs to be animated and have a website with screenshots to prove it.<br /></li><li>If a future animator succesfully learns from the mod team then he/she offers his/her services to the Think Tank so we can help others out as well.</li></ul></div>

The Animators Think Tank is *not* a quick way to have some people animate stuff for your mod, it should be a great step forward into learning animation and should offer you real tangeable help in the form of example scenes with the models of the mod in question.<br /></div>&#13;<br /><br />Maybe the best way to get the best "bang-for-buck" is to make it a condition that mod makers can only ask the ATT for a tutorial to be written for an specific area (but not for a specific mod or specific model). That way general information any mod maker can use is produced.</div>

<br />With some mods being forced to stop in part due to a lack of animators and with the extreme shortage of real animators in the Doom3 community We have started a think tank of animators offering their help to established mod teams in need of animation help.
<br /><br />The team members are:
<br /><ul><li>BloodRayne - Weapons Animation Advice</li><li>crimity</li><li>der_ton - Technical Advisor</li></ul>Tentative Members:<br /><ul><li>Johnny B. Goode</li><li>fault_line</li></ul>On a side note: <span style="font-weight: bold">We need more animators and <span style="text-decoration: underline">I know they're out there</span></span>. This idea (and some mods as well) will stand or fall with finding animators capable of spending time on this. I myself am really *really* busy but I feel it's important to contribute to this <span style="font-weight: bold">so I will step up myself as the first member</span>, but not as teamleader. I have knowledge and some experience in animating weapons and I would like to share whatever I know with the modding community.<br /><br />So, if you can animate for Doom3 or if you are an animator for a modteam currently working on a mod then I would like to ask you to join the Animators Think Tank that will help out the entire modding community and hopefully prevent more mods from having to stop due to the lack of Animators currently available for Doom3.<br /><br />Mod teams can ask the Animators Think Tank (or ATT in short) for help, with only a few conditions in return: <br /><ul><li>The mod team has read and tried the several tutorials available to them. (will be made available in this thread/post).<br /></li><li>The mod team tries to learn as much as possible from this help in order to learn the animation part as soon as possible so they can carry on the work for the mod themselves. <br /></li><li>Help can consist of making example animations and scenes for the current 3d packages available. The Animators Think Tank is *not* a quick way to have some people animate stuff for your mod, it should be a great step forward into learning animation and should offer you real tangeable help in the form of example scenes with the models of the mod in question.<br /></li><li>The mod team asking for help is working for an established mod, has a working, finished, model that needs to be animated and have a website with screenshots to prove it.<br /></li><li>If a future animator succesfully learns from the mod team then he/she offers his/her services to the Think Tank so we can help others out as well.</li></ul></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74330" date="Posted: Wed Jan 26, 2005 9:22 pm "><author>doomkid3000</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">this is a good thread we should sticky this for animators helping out i think when they setup there models for animation they should rig them with IK's so they can be animated with ease <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74343" date="Posted: Wed Jan 26, 2005 10:28 pm "><author>rich_is_bored</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Sticky like the inside of Pee Wee's pants. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74401" date="Posted: Thu Jan 27, 2005 3:03 am "><author>Johnny B.

<br /><br />Maybe the best way to get the best "bang-for-buck" is to make it a condition that mod makers can only ask the ATT for a tutorial to be written for an specific area (but not for a specific mod or specific model). That way general information any mod maker can use is produced.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p74418" date="Posted: Thu Jan 27, 2005 5:35 am "><author>Cody64</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Maybe we can do something like this...but for models.....

<br /><br />it seems like if a total conversion team can't find an animator, they quit. if a tc team can't find one, then the lead person should scale back the scope of the mod and then take the time to learn the basics of animating. isn't that better then trashing everything?
<br /><br />imo, all these tc's that are quitting start off with a project that's too ambitious.
<br /><br />just my opinion. sorry to get off topic...</div>]]></body></post><post id="p74886" date="Posted: Sat Jan 29, 2005 9:29 am "><author>BloodRayne</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Johnny B.

						<div class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold">Welcome to the Animators Think Tank!</span>
<br />With some mods being forced to stop in part due to a lack of animators and with the extreme shortage of real animators in the Doom3 community We have started a think tank of animators offering their help to established mod teams in need of animation help.
<br /><br />The team members are:
<br /><ul><li>BloodRayne - Weapons Animation Advice</li><li>crimity</li><li>der_ton - Technical Advisor</li></ul>Tentative Members:<br /><ul><li>Johnny B. Goode</li><li>fault_line</li></ul>On a side note: <span style="font-weight: bold">We need more animators and <span style="text-decoration: underline">I know they're out there</span></span>. This idea (and some mods as well) will stand or fall with finding animators capable of spending time on this. I myself am really *really* busy but I feel it's important to contribute to this <span style="font-weight: bold">so I will step up myself as the first member</span>, but not as teamleader. I have knowledge and some experience in animating weapons and I would like to share whatever I know with the modding community.<br /><br />So, if you can animate for Doom3 or if you are an animator for a modteam currently working on a mod then I would like to ask you to join the Animators Think Tank that will help out the entire modding community and hopefully prevent more mods from having to stop due to the lack of Animators currently available for Doom3.<br /><br />Mod teams can ask the Animators Think Tank (or ATT in short) for help, with only a few conditions in return: <br /><ul><li>The mod team has read and tried the several tutorials available to them. (will be made available in this thread/post).<br /></li><li>The mod team tries to learn as much as possible from this help in order to learn the animation part as soon as possible so they can carry on the work for the mod themselves. <br /></li><li>Help can consist of making example animations and scenes for the current 3d packages available. The Animators Think Tank is *not* a quick way to have some people animate stuff for your mod, it should be a great step forward into learning animation and should offer you real tangeable help in the form of example scenes with the models of the mod in question.<br /></li><li>The mod team asking for help is working for an established mod, has a working, finished, model that needs to be animated and have a website with screenshots to prove it.<br /></li><li>If a future animator succesfully learns from the mod team then he/she offers his/her services to the Think Tank so we can help others out as well.</li></ul></div>

						<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">BloodRayne wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />1 - The mod team tries to learn as much as possible from this help in order to learn the animation part as soon as possible so they can carry on the work for the mod themselves. <br /><br />2 - Help can consist of making example animations and scenes for the current 3d packages available. The Animators Think Tank is *not* a quick way to have some people animate stuff for your mod, it should be a great step forward into learning animation and should offer you real tangeable help in the form of example scenes with the models of the mod in question.<br /></div>
<br /><br />Maybe the best way to get the best "bang-for-buck" is to make it a condition that mod makers can only ask the ATT for a tutorial to be written for an specific area (but not for a specific mod or specific model). That way general information any mod maker can use is produced.</div>

						<div class="postbody">understood.
<br /><br />it seems like if a total conversion team can't find an animator, they quit. if a tc team can't find one, then the lead person should scale back the scope of the mod and then take the time to learn the basics of animating. isn't that better then trashing everything?
<br /><br />imo, all these tc's that are quitting start off with a project that's too ambitious.
<br /><br />just my opinion. sorry to get off topic...</div>

<br />With some mods being forced to stop in part due to a lack of animators and with the extreme shortage of real animators in the Doom3 community We have started a think tank of animators offering their help to established mod teams in need of animation help.
<br /><br />The team members are:
<br /><ul><li>BloodRayne - Weapons Animation Advice</li><li>crimity</li><li>der_ton - Technical Advisor</li></ul>Tentative Members:<br /><ul><li>Johnny B. Goode</li><li>fault_line</li></ul>On a side note: <span style="font-weight: bold">We need more animators and <span style="text-decoration: underline">I know they're out there</span></span>. This idea (and some mods as well) will stand or fall with finding animators capable of spending time on this. I myself am really *really* busy but I feel it's important to contribute to this <span style="font-weight: bold">so I will step up myself as the first member</span>, but not as teamleader. I have knowledge and some experience in animating weapons and I would like to share whatever I know with the modding community.<br /><br />So, if you can animate for Doom3 or if you are an animator for a modteam currently working on a mod then I would like to ask you to join the Animators Think Tank that will help out the entire modding community and hopefully prevent more mods from having to stop due to the lack of Animators currently available for Doom3.<br /><br />Mod teams can ask the Animators Think Tank (or ATT in short) for help, with only a few conditions in return: <br /><ul><li>The mod team has read and tried the several tutorials available to them. (will be made available in this thread/post).<br /></li><li>The mod team tries to learn as much as possible from this help in order to learn the animation part as soon as possible so they can carry on the work for the mod themselves. <br /></li><li>Help can consist of making example animations and scenes for the current 3d packages available. The Animators Think Tank is *not* a quick way to have some people animate stuff for your mod, it should be a great step forward into learning animation and should offer you real tangeable help in the form of example scenes with the models of the mod in question.<br /></li><li>The mod team asking for help is working for an established mod, has a working, finished, model that needs to be animated and have a website with screenshots to prove it.<br /></li><li>If a future animator succesfully learns from the mod team then he/she offers his/her services to the Think Tank so we can help others out as well.</li></ul></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74330" date="Posted: Wed Jan 26, 2005 9:22 pm "><author>doomkid3000</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">this is a good thread we should sticky this for animators helping out i think when they setup there models for animation they should rig them with IK's so they can be animated with ease <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74343" date="Posted: Wed Jan 26, 2005 10:28 pm "><author>rich_is_bored</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Sticky like the inside of Pee Wee's pants. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74401" date="Posted: Thu Jan 27, 2005 3:03 am "><author>Johnny B.

<br /><br />Well, when you have a million other things that need to be done, it is hard to also try to learn modeling....  I have learned to animate, but will not have enough free time for quite a while to learn to model any thing decent <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />  I just have far too many other things I am responsible for <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74556" date="Posted: Thu Jan 27, 2005 5:03 pm "><author>pbmax</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">understood.
<br /><br />it seems like if a total conversion team can't find an animator, they quit. if a tc team can't find one, then the lead person should scale back the scope of the mod and then take the time to learn the basics of animating. isn't that better then trashing everything?
<br /><br />imo, all these tc's that are quitting start off with a project that's too ambitious.
<br /><br />just my opinion. sorry to get off topic...</div>]]></body></post><post id="p74886" date="Posted: Sat Jan 29, 2005 9:29 am "><author>BloodRayne</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Johnny B.

						<div class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold">Welcome to the Animators Think Tank!</span>
<br />With some mods being forced to stop in part due to a lack of animators and with the extreme shortage of real animators in the Doom3 community We have started a think tank of animators offering their help to established mod teams in need of animation help.
<br /><br />The team members are:
<br /><ul><li>BloodRayne - Weapons Animation Advice</li><li>crimity</li><li>der_ton - Technical Advisor</li></ul>Tentative Members:<br /><ul><li>Johnny B. Goode</li><li>fault_line</li></ul>On a side note: <span style="font-weight: bold">We need more animators and <span style="text-decoration: underline">I know they're out there</span></span>. This idea (and some mods as well) will stand or fall with finding animators capable of spending time on this. I myself am really *really* busy but I feel it's important to contribute to this <span style="font-weight: bold">so I will step up myself as the first member</span>, but not as teamleader. I have knowledge and some experience in animating weapons and I would like to share whatever I know with the modding community.<br /><br />So, if you can animate for Doom3 or if you are an animator for a modteam currently working on a mod then I would like to ask you to join the Animators Think Tank that will help out the entire modding community and hopefully prevent more mods from having to stop due to the lack of Animators currently available for Doom3.<br /><br />Mod teams can ask the Animators Think Tank (or ATT in short) for help, with only a few conditions in return: <br /><ul><li>The mod team has read and tried the several tutorials available to them. (will be made available in this thread/post).<br /></li><li>The mod team tries to learn as much as possible from this help in order to learn the animation part as soon as possible so they can carry on the work for the mod themselves. <br /></li><li>Help can consist of making example animations and scenes for the current 3d packages available. The Animators Think Tank is *not* a quick way to have some people animate stuff for your mod, it should be a great step forward into learning animation and should offer you real tangeable help in the form of example scenes with the models of the mod in question.<br /></li><li>The mod team asking for help is working for an established mod, has a working, finished, model that needs to be animated and have a website with screenshots to prove it.<br /></li><li>If a future animator succesfully learns from the mod team then he/she offers his/her services to the Think Tank so we can help others out as well.</li></ul></div>

						<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">BloodRayne wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />1 - The mod team tries to learn as much as possible from this help in order to learn the animation part as soon as possible so they can carry on the work for the mod themselves. <br /><br />2 - Help can consist of making example animations and scenes for the current 3d packages available. The Animators Think Tank is *not* a quick way to have some people animate stuff for your mod, it should be a great step forward into learning animation and should offer you real tangeable help in the form of example scenes with the models of the mod in question.<br /></div>
<br /><br />Maybe the best way to get the best "bang-for-buck" is to make it a condition that mod makers can only ask the ATT for a tutorial to be written for an specific area (but not for a specific mod or specific model). That way general information any mod maker can use is produced.</div>

						<div class="postbody">understood.
<br /><br />it seems like if a total conversion team can't find an animator, they quit. if a tc team can't find one, then the lead person should scale back the scope of the mod and then take the time to learn the basics of animating. isn't that better then trashing everything?
<br /><br />imo, all these tc's that are quitting start off with a project that's too ambitious.
<br /><br />just my opinion. sorry to get off topic...</div>

<br />With some mods being forced to stop in part due to a lack of animators and with the extreme shortage of real animators in the Doom3 community We have started a think tank of animators offering their help to established mod teams in need of animation help.
<br /><br />The team members are:
<br /><ul><li>BloodRayne - Weapons Animation Advice</li><li>crimity</li><li>der_ton - Technical Advisor</li></ul>Tentative Members:<br /><ul><li>Johnny B. Goode</li><li>fault_line</li></ul>On a side note: <span style="font-weight: bold">We need more animators and <span style="text-decoration: underline">I know they're out there</span></span>. This idea (and some mods as well) will stand or fall with finding animators capable of spending time on this. I myself am really *really* busy but I feel it's important to contribute to this <span style="font-weight: bold">so I will step up myself as the first member</span>, but not as teamleader. I have knowledge and some experience in animating weapons and I would like to share whatever I know with the modding community.<br /><br />So, if you can animate for Doom3 or if you are an animator for a modteam currently working on a mod then I would like to ask you to join the Animators Think Tank that will help out the entire modding community and hopefully prevent more mods from having to stop due to the lack of Animators currently available for Doom3.<br /><br />Mod teams can ask the Animators Think Tank (or ATT in short) for help, with only a few conditions in return: <br /><ul><li>The mod team has read and tried the several tutorials available to them. (will be made available in this thread/post).<br /></li><li>The mod team tries to learn as much as possible from this help in order to learn the animation part as soon as possible so they can carry on the work for the mod themselves. <br /></li><li>Help can consist of making example animations and scenes for the current 3d packages available. The Animators Think Tank is *not* a quick way to have some people animate stuff for your mod, it should be a great step forward into learning animation and should offer you real tangeable help in the form of example scenes with the models of the mod in question.<br /></li><li>The mod team asking for help is working for an established mod, has a working, finished, model that needs to be animated and have a website with screenshots to prove it.<br /></li><li>If a future animator succesfully learns from the mod team then he/she offers his/her services to the Think Tank so we can help others out as well.</li></ul></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74330" date="Posted: Wed Jan 26, 2005 9:22 pm "><author>doomkid3000</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">this is a good thread we should sticky this for animators helping out i think when they setup there models for animation they should rig them with IK's so they can be animated with ease <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74343" date="Posted: Wed Jan 26, 2005 10:28 pm "><author>rich_is_bored</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Sticky like the inside of Pee Wee's pants. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74401" date="Posted: Thu Jan 27, 2005 3:03 am "><author>Johnny B.

<br /><br />Well, when you have a million other things that need to be done, it is hard to also try to learn modeling....  I have learned to animate, but will not have enough free time for quite a while to learn to model any thing decent <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />  I just have far too many other things I am responsible for <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74556" date="Posted: Thu Jan 27, 2005 5:03 pm "><author>pbmax</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">understood.
<br /><br />it seems like if a total conversion team can't find an animator, they quit. if a tc team can't find one, then the lead person should scale back the scope of the mod and then take the time to learn the basics of animating. isn't that better then trashing everything?
<br /><br />imo, all these tc's that are quitting start off with a project that's too ambitious.
<br /><br />just my opinion. sorry to get off topic...</div>]]></body></post><post id="p74886" date="Posted: Sat Jan 29, 2005 9:29 am "><author>BloodRayne</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Johnny B.

<br /><br />This thread shouldn't get off topic, TC's mean a great big bunch of work and animation is one of the toughest things to work on in the mod.

						<div class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold">Welcome to the Animators Think Tank!</span>
<br />With some mods being forced to stop in part due to a lack of animators and with the extreme shortage of real animators in the Doom3 community We have started a think tank of animators offering their help to established mod teams in need of animation help.
<br /><br />The team members are:
<br /><ul><li>BloodRayne - Weapons Animation Advice</li><li>crimity</li><li>der_ton - Technical Advisor</li></ul>Tentative Members:<br /><ul><li>Johnny B. Goode</li><li>fault_line</li></ul>On a side note: <span style="font-weight: bold">We need more animators and <span style="text-decoration: underline">I know they're out there</span></span>. This idea (and some mods as well) will stand or fall with finding animators capable of spending time on this. I myself am really *really* busy but I feel it's important to contribute to this <span style="font-weight: bold">so I will step up myself as the first member</span>, but not as teamleader. I have knowledge and some experience in animating weapons and I would like to share whatever I know with the modding community.<br /><br />So, if you can animate for Doom3 or if you are an animator for a modteam currently working on a mod then I would like to ask you to join the Animators Think Tank that will help out the entire modding community and hopefully prevent more mods from having to stop due to the lack of Animators currently available for Doom3.<br /><br />Mod teams can ask the Animators Think Tank (or ATT in short) for help, with only a few conditions in return: <br /><ul><li>The mod team has read and tried the several tutorials available to them. (will be made available in this thread/post).<br /></li><li>The mod team tries to learn as much as possible from this help in order to learn the animation part as soon as possible so they can carry on the work for the mod themselves. <br /></li><li>Help can consist of making example animations and scenes for the current 3d packages available. The Animators Think Tank is *not* a quick way to have some people animate stuff for your mod, it should be a great step forward into learning animation and should offer you real tangeable help in the form of example scenes with the models of the mod in question.<br /></li><li>The mod team asking for help is working for an established mod, has a working, finished, model that needs to be animated and have a website with screenshots to prove it.<br /></li><li>If a future animator succesfully learns from the mod team then he/she offers his/her services to the Think Tank so we can help others out as well.</li></ul></div>

						<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">BloodRayne wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />1 - The mod team tries to learn as much as possible from this help in order to learn the animation part as soon as possible so they can carry on the work for the mod themselves. <br /><br />2 - Help can consist of making example animations and scenes for the current 3d packages available. The Animators Think Tank is *not* a quick way to have some people animate stuff for your mod, it should be a great step forward into learning animation and should offer you real tangeable help in the form of example scenes with the models of the mod in question.<br /></div>
<br /><br />Maybe the best way to get the best "bang-for-buck" is to make it a condition that mod makers can only ask the ATT for a tutorial to be written for an specific area (but not for a specific mod or specific model). That way general information any mod maker can use is produced.</div>

						<div class="postbody">understood.
<br /><br />it seems like if a total conversion team can't find an animator, they quit. if a tc team can't find one, then the lead person should scale back the scope of the mod and then take the time to learn the basics of animating. isn't that better then trashing everything?
<br /><br />imo, all these tc's that are quitting start off with a project that's too ambitious.
<br /><br />just my opinion. sorry to get off topic...</div>

Goode</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Just went through several problems dealing with getting a new weapon to work in this thread:&#13;<br /><a href="viewtopic.php?t=8759" class="postlink">http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=8759</a>, most of which pertained to the .def file for the weapon.&#13;<br /><br />As far as exporting the animations it depends on what you used to animate them. If you used maya, the exporter is built into doom3. The exports are usually done in the .def file for whatever you're creating, but this does not have to be so. It is explained here:<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.iddevnet.com/doom3/modelexport.php" class="postlink">http://www.iddevnet.com/doom3/modelexport.php</a> There is also a MD5 exporter script for maya here:<a href="viewtopic.php?t=2517" class="postlink">http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=2517</a>, this will allow you to export everything to final format without using Doom3.&#13;<br /><br />If you used a program other than maya, have no fear. You can either bring the models into maya to do the animations, or use one of several available export scripts for your prefered modeling package.&#13;<br /><br />der_ton has created import and export scripts for blender, they can be found here:&#13;<br />Export script&gt;&gt;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=1711" class="postlink">http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=1711</a>&#13;<br />Import script&gt;&gt;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=6901" class="postlink">http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=6901</a>&#13;<br /><br />For lightwave:&#13;<br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=4595" class="postlink">http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=4595</a>&#13;<br /><br />There's quite a bit of info dealing with importing/exporting for max/gmax in the MAX forum:<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewforum.php?f=53" class="postlink">http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewforum.php?f=53</a>&#13;<br /><br />I'm working with blender, and I'm a noob, so I can't really tell you much about the other programs. I can, however, tell you that those pesky .def and .script files are dealt with in detail in the scripting forum. If you're having a specific problem just post it and I'm sure everybody will do their best to help you out.&#13;<br /><br />Hope that helps,&#13;<br /><br />Johnny</div>]]></body></post><post id="p77821" date="Posted: Wed Feb 16, 2005 9:15 am "><author>Live-wirE</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks alot dude but that maya export script that cat done only works wif the demo version of doom i think thanks for the help tho and will look at the .def section cheers</div>]]></body></post><post id="p77878" date="Posted: Wed Feb 16, 2005 5:07 pm "><author>Brain Trepaning</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">LIP SYNCING&#13;<br /><br />I made a lip synced animation for my Grandmother for Xmas this year. You can download the "Sassy Senior" on my website. All the lip syncing was done in real time, with me speaking into a microphone. I did not tweak ANY of the lip syncing, so a couple of blips happen. However, the program I used was free. Again, real time, speaking into a microphone (once the dozen necessary morph targets had been made, of course). For animations, it worked great. It would also work great for game lip syncing IF der_ton were to rework his ADD-BONES MD5 exporter for Max a little bit. If that does not happen, then this little known program will serve no one any good for Doom 3, so I won't even mention its name. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p77977" date="Posted: Thu Feb 17, 2005 9:27 am "><author>SyPHer_</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Brain Trepaning wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">"Sassy Senior"</div>&#13;<br /><br />lol!

It defines the location of the character in the game... So the collision box is relitive to the origin.&#13;<br /><br />If I were a mod crew without an animator, I would build my models and characters right over top of the DOOM3 models (probably using the md5importer) this way our team could take advantage of all the awesome work that Fred and the guys did for you.

So the animator can actually have it move around their modelling program without having to reposition the entire bone structure on export.. This is extremely nice when having a npc interact with the environment..  or just for walking animations even..&#13;<br /><br />I've finally gotten a chance to really start looking a little more in depth at d3's animation..

(not all might agree) &#13;<br /><br />I would start with the weapons, because they are generally speaking a little bit easier to understand, have less animations (usually only between 5 and 10 different anims) and will teach you the basics for animating for Doom3. The animations itself are quite selfexplanetory. You create bones, attach the bones to the model and animate those bones using keyframes or frame to frame animation. Then, if you position one bone in a certain way part of the model will move accordingly, etc..etc..&#13;<br /><br />What kind of stuff/plugins you'll be using for this depends on which 3d program you use. So, before we can help we'll need to know is which 3d progra

If you used maya, the exporter is built into doom3. The exports are usually done in the .def file for whatever you're creating, but this does not have to be so. It is explained here:<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.iddevnet.com/doom3/modelexport.php" class="postlink">http://www.iddevnet.com/doom3/modelexport.php</a> There is also a MD5 exporter script for maya here:<a href="viewtopic.php?t=2517" class="postlink">http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=2517</a>, this will allow you to export everything to final format without using Doom3.&#13;<br /><br />If you used a program other than maya, have no fear. You can either bring the models into maya to do the animations, or use one of several available export scripts for your prefered modeling package.&#13;<br /><br />der_ton has created import and export scripts for blender, they can be found here:&#13;<br />Export script&gt;&gt;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=1711" class="postlink">http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=1711</a>&#13;<br />Import script&gt;&gt;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=6901" class="postlink">http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=6901</a>&#13;<br /><br />For lightwave:&#13;<br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=4595" class="postlink">http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=4595</a>&#13;<br /><br />There's quite a bit of info dealing with importing/exporting for max/gmax in the MAX forum:<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewforum.php?f=53" class="postlink">http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewforum.php?f=53</a>&#13;<br /><br />I'm working with blender, and I'm a noob, so I can't really tell you much about the other programs. I can, however, tell you that those pesky .def and .script files are dealt with in detail in the scripting forum.

You can download the "Sassy Senior" on my website. All the lip syncing was done in real time, with me speaking into a microphone. I did not tweak ANY of the lip syncing, so a couple of blips happen. However, the program I used was free. Again, real time, speaking into a microphone (once the dozen necessary morph targets had been made, of course). For animations, it worked great. It would also work great for game lip syncing IF der_ton were to rework his ADD-BONES MD5 exporter for Max a little bit. If that does not happen, then this little known program will serve no one any good for Doom 3, so I won't even mention its name. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p77977" date="Posted: Thu Feb 17, 2005 9:27 am "><author>SyPHer_</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Brain Trepaning wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">"Sassy Senior"</div>&#13;<br /><br />lol!

It defines the location of the character in the game... So the collision box is relitive to the origin.&#13;<br /><br />If I were a mod crew without an animator, I would build my models and characters right over top of the DOOM3 models (probably using the md5importer) this way our team could take advantage of all the awesome work that Fred and the guys did for you.

That's awesome..  &#13;<br /><br />Thanks for adding that bit of info.. on a side note for others reading.. the entity itself can also follow the origin bone I believe.. So the animator can actually have it move around their modelling program without having to reposition the entire bone structure on export.. This is extremely nice when having a npc interact with the environment..  or just for walking animations even..&#13;<br /><br />I've finally gotten a chance to really start looking a little more in depth at d3's animation..

(not all might agree) &#13;<br /><br />I would start with the weapons, because they are generally speaking a little bit easier to understand, have less animations (usually only between 5 and 10 different anims) and will teach you the basics for animating for Doom3. The animations itself are quite selfexplanetory. You create bones, attach the bones to the model and animate those bones using keyframes or frame to frame animation. Then, if you position one bone in a certain way part of the model will move accordingly, etc..etc..&#13;<br /><br />What kind of stuff/plugins you'll be using for this depends on which 3d program you use. So, before we can help we'll need to know is which 3d progr

(not all might agree) &#13;<br /><br />I would start with the weapons, because they are generally speaking a little bit easier to understand, have less animations (usually only between 5 and 10 different anims) and will teach you the basics for animating for Doom3. The animations itself are quite selfexplanetory. You create bones, attach the bones to the model and animate those bones using keyframes or frame to frame animation. Then, if you position one bone in a certain way part of the model will move accordingly, etc..etc..&#13;<br /><br />What kind of stuff/plugins you'll be using for this depends on which 3d program you use. So, before we can help we'll need to know is which 3d progr

Something like this for lightwave :  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.thomas4d.com/html/t4d_rigging_tools.html" target="_blank">http://www.thomas4d.com/html/t4d_rigging_tools.html</a>     (halfway down page - Negative Frame paste plugins)&#13;

The bone phoneme positions in the face are created in negative frames then using the plugin they're essentially pasted into the frame you choose.   &#13;

I'm working towards becoming a D3 mod animator myself (I have already become a bit of a modeller), but I have to say that the way it's done in Doom 3 is way beyond me so far (haven't yet learned to use bones, which is what Id have used).&#13;
<br/><br/>
Right now I'm just sorta poking around, checking out Doom 3's models (sadly, the MD5 importer for Max I have got my hands on as of now has a beef with animation files, so I can't really check out Id's animations yet).&#13;

You can probably expect me to ask some questions (but hopefully, I will be able to help out eventually).&#13;

 Im just trying to animate some weaponry for Cody64  ive used maya b4 for animating I know abit about bones IKs Constraints and such.....But wouldnt it be easier if there were just a couple of arms all ready rigged with IKs and Controls.&#13;
<br/>
Im just finding it hard trying to move the arms around from the MG without distorting the polys to much.&#13;
<br/>
Theres alot of stuff in doom that im not sure about....&#13;
<br/>
Im not to sure why the MG bones come from the origin....cos Im thinking if I have to rig it myself then do I have to do that to?&#13;
<br/>
Like the skinnig is smooth not rigid but can i still ridid bind the skin....and if so can I use flexors?&#13;
<br/>
Is there a set guide line the doom animators worked from cos Im sure that would help alot of people out....just so they know in which order to at least proceed.&#13;
<br/>
I like animating alot, its heaps of fun (when everythings rigged properly) its just getting everything rigged properly that kinda sux.&#13;

Anyway the Animations for Doom3 fully Rock ..just watching the way the MG reloads is so cool...Thanx for allowing us to check them out!!&#13;

No flexors will not export to d3.. assuming flexors are somewhat similar to 3dsmax's bulge tool (used to make muscles bulge and such.. doesnt apply weight information)..  D3 looks only at weights for vertices.. for the bones though, it looks at all normal transformations (move scale rotate)..&#13;
<br/><br/>
If you are getting distorted polys like that, check your weights.. Some vertices may be applied to the wrong bone.. or not blended between bones properly..  Or it might simply be the way your mesh is set up..&#13;

D3 looks only at weights for vertices.. for the bones though, it looks at all normal transformations (move scale rotate)..&#13;<br /><br />If you are getting distorted polys like that, check your weights.. Some vertices may be applied to the wrong bone.. or not blended between bones properly..

If you used maya, the exporter is built into doom3. The exports are usually done in the .def file for whatever you're creating, but this does not have to be so. It is explained here:<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.iddevnet.com/doom3/modelexport.php" class="postlink">http://www.iddevnet.com/doom3/modelexport.php</a> There is also a MD5 exporter script for maya here:<a href="viewtopic.php?t=2517" class="postlink">http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=2517</a>, this will allow you to export everything to final format without using Doom3.&#13;<br /><br />If you used a program other than maya, have no fear. You can either bring the models into maya to do the animations, or use one of several available export scripts for your prefered modeling package.&#13;<br /><br />der_ton has created import and export scripts for blender, they can be found here:&#13;<br />Export script&gt;&gt;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=1711" class="postlink">http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=1711</a>&#13;<br />Import script&gt;&gt;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=6901" class="postlink">http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=6901</a>&#13;<br /><br />For lightwave:&#13;<br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=4595" class="postlink">http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=4595</a>&#13;<br /><br />There's quite a bit of info dealing with importing/exporting for max/gmax in the MAX forum:<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewforum.php?f=53" class="postlink">http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewforum.php?f=53</a>&#13;<br /><br />I'm working with blender, and I'm a noob, so I can't really tell you much about the other programs. I can, however, tell you that those pesky .def and .script files are dealt with in detail in the scripting forum.

It defines the location of the character in the game... So the collision box is relitive to the origin.&#13;<br /><br />If I were a mod crew without an animator, I would build my models and characters right over top of the DOOM3 models (probably using the md5importer) this way our team could take advantage of all the awesome work that Fred and the guys did for you.

That's awesome..  &#13;<br /><br />Thanks for adding that bit of info.. on a side note for others reading.. the entity itself can also follow the origin bone I believe.. So the animator can actually have it move around their modelling program without having to reposition the entire bone structure on export.. This is extremely nice when having a npc interact with the environment..  or just for walking animations even..&#13;<br /><br />I've finally gotten a chance to really start looking a little more in depth at d3's animation..

(not all might agree) &#13;<br /><br />I would start with the weapons, because they are generally speaking a little bit easier to understand, have less animations (usually only between 5 and 10 different anims) and will teach you the basics for animating for Doom3. The animations itself are quite selfexplanetory. You create bones, attach the bones to the model and animate those bones using keyframes or frame to frame animation. Then, if you position one bone in a certain way part of the model will move accordingly, etc..etc..&#13;<br /><br />What kind of stuff/plugins you'll be using for this depends on which 3d program you use. So, before we can help we'll need to know is which 3d progra

If you used maya, the exporter is built into doom3. The exports are usually done in the .def file for whatever you're creating, but this does not have to be so. It is explained here:<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.iddevnet.com/doom3/modelexport.php" class="postlink">http://www.iddevnet.com/doom3/modelexport.php</a> There is also a MD5 exporter script for maya here:<a href="viewtopic.php?t=2517" class="postlink">http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=2517</a>, this will allow you to export everything to final format without using Doom3.&#13;<br /><br />If you used a program other than maya, have no fear. You can either bring the models into maya to do the animations, or use one of several available export scripts for your prefered modeling package.&#13;<br /><br />der_ton has created import and export scripts for blender, they can be found here:&#13;<br />Export script&gt;&gt;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=1711" class="postlink">http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=1711</a>&#13;<br />Import script&gt;&gt;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=6901" class="postlink">http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=6901</a>&#13;<br /><br />For lightwave:&#13;<br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=4595" class="postlink">http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=4595</a>&#13;<br /><br />There's quite a bit of info dealing with importing/exporting for max/gmax in the MAX forum:<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewforum.php?f=53" class="postlink">http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewforum.php?f=53</a>&#13;<br /><br />I'm working with blender, and I'm a noob, so I can't really tell you much about the other programs.

You can download the "Sassy Senior" on my website. All the lip syncing was done in real time, with me speaking into a microphone. I did not tweak ANY of the lip syncing, so a couple of blips happen. However, the program I used was free. Again, real time, speaking into a microphone (once the dozen necessary morph targets had been made, of course). For animations, it worked great. It would also work great for game lip syncing IF der_ton were to rework his ADD-BONES MD5 exporter for Max a little bit. If that does not happen, then this little known program will serve no one any good for Doom 3, so I won't even mention its name. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p77977" date="Posted: Thu Feb 17, 2005 9:27 am "><author>SyPHer_</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Brain Trepaning wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">"Sassy Senior"</div>&#13;<br /><br />lol!

It defines the location of the character in the game... So the collision box is relitive to the origin.&#13;<br /><br />If I were a mod crew without an animator, I would build my models and characters right over top of the DOOM3 models (probably using the md5importer) this way our team could take advantage of all the awesome work that Fred and the guys did for you.

That's awesome..  &#13;<br /><br />Thanks for adding that bit of info.. on a side note for others reading.. the entity itself can also follow the origin bone I believe.. So the animator can actually have it move around their modelling program without having to reposition the entire bone structure on export.. This is extremely nice when having a npc interact with the environment..  or just for walking animations even..&#13;<br /><br />I've finally gotten a chance to really start looking a little more in depth at d3's animation..

(not all might agree) &#13;<br /><br />I would start with the weapons, because they are generally speaking a little bit easier to understand, have less animations (usually only between 5 and 10 different anims) and will teach you the basics for animating for Doom3. The animations itself are quite selfexplanetory. You create bones, attach the bones to the model and animate those bones using keyframes or frame to frame animation. Then, if you position one bone in a certain way part of the model will move accordingly, etc..etc..&#13;<br /><br />What kind of stuff/plugins you'll be using for this depends on which 3d program you use. So, before we can help we'll need to know is which 3d progra

It defines the location of the character in the game... So the collision box is relitive to the origin.&#13;<br /><br />If I were a mod crew without an animator, I would build my models and characters right over top of the DOOM3 models (probably using the md5importer) this way our team could take advantage of all the awesome work that Fred and the guys did for you.

That's awesome..  &#13;<br /><br />Thanks for adding that bit of info.. on a side note for others reading.. the entity itself can also follow the origin bone I believe.. So the animator can actually have it move around their modelling program without having to reposition the entire bone structure on export.. This is extremely nice when having a npc interact with the environment..  or just for walking animations even..&#13;<br /><br />I've finally gotten a chance to really start looking a little more in depth at d3's animation..

(not all might agree) &#13;<br /><br />I would start with the weapons, because they are generally speaking a little bit easier to understand, have less animations (usually only between 5 and 10 different anims) and will teach you the basics for animating for Doom3. The animations itself are quite selfexplanetory. You create bones, attach the bones to the model and animate those bones using keyframes or frame to frame animation. Then, if you position one bone in a certain way part of the model will move accordingly, etc..etc..&#13;<br /><br />What kind of stuff/plugins you'll be using for this depends on which 3d program you use. So, before we can help we'll need to know is which 3d progra

D3 looks only at weights for vertices.. for the bones though, it looks at all normal transformations (move scale rotate)..&#13;<br /><br />If you are getting distorted polys like that, check your weights.. Some vertices may be applied to the wrong bone.. or not blended between bones properly..

If you used maya, the exporter is built into doom3. The exports are usually done in the .def file for whatever you're creating, but this does not have to be so. It is explained here:<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.iddevnet.com/doom3/modelexport.php" class="postlink">http://www.iddevnet.com/doom3/modelexport.php</a> There is also a MD5 exporter script for maya here:<a href="viewtopic.php?t=2517" class="postlink">http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=2517</a>, this will allow you to export everything to final format without using Doom3.&#13;<br /><br />If you used a program other than maya, have no fear. You can either bring the models into maya to do the animations, or use one of several available export scripts for your prefered modeling package.&#13;<br /><br />der_ton has created import and export scripts for blender, they can be found here:&#13;<br />Export script&gt;&gt;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=1711" class="postlink">http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=1711</a>&#13;<br />Import script&gt;&gt;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=6901" class="postlink">http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=6901</a>&#13;<br /><br />For lightwave:&#13;<br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=4595" class="postlink">http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=4595</a>&#13;<br /><br />There's quite a bit of info dealing with importing/exporting for max/gmax in the MAX forum:<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewforum.php?f=53" class="postlink">http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewforum.php?f=53</a>&#13;<br /><br />I'm working with blender, and I'm a noob, so I can't really tell you much about the other programs. I can, however, tell you that those pesky .def and .script files are dealt with in detail in the scripting forum. If you're having a specific problem just post it and I'm sure everybody will do their best to help you out.&#13;<br /><br />Hope that helps,&#13;<br /><br />Johnny</div>]]></body></post><post id="p77821" date="Posted: Wed Feb 16, 2005 9:15 am "><author>Live-wirE</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks alot dude but that maya export script that cat done only works wif the demo version of doom i think thanks for the help tho and will look at the .def section cheers</div>]]></body></post><post id="p77878" date="Posted: Wed Feb 16, 2005 5:07 pm "><author>Brain Trepaning</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">LIP SYNCING&#13;<br /><br />I made a lip synced animation for my Grandmother for Xmas this year. You can download the "Sassy Senior" on my website. All the lip syncing was done in real time, with me speaking into a microphone. I did not tweak ANY of the lip syncing, so a couple of blips happen. However, the program I used was free. Again, real time, speaking into a microphone (once the dozen necessary morph targets had been made, of course). For animations, it worked great. It would also work great for game lip syncing IF der_ton were to rework his ADD-BONES MD5 exporter for Max a little bit. If that does not happen, then this little known program will serve no one any good for Doom 3, so I won't even mention its name. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p77977" date="Posted: Thu Feb 17, 2005 9:27 am "><author>SyPHer_</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Brain Trepaning wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">"Sassy Senior"</div>&#13;<br /><br />lol!

It' not the syntax things that makes me worried, it's the mathematical aspect.. I really can barely do 5+5 = 12..

I have a scene where a f-16 jet is flying through the level (animated in 3dsmax and exported to md5) and I would like to add some jet engine sounds to it that move with the jet....... just binding the speaker to the model-entity's name didn't do the trick since the entity itself is not moving .........&#13;

You don't need to, since it's an entity you can just call the sound from the animation def. An example:&#13;

"f16_jet_engine" is a looped soundshader that starts to play at frame 1 and gets played by the origin bone by default.... you can also define in the entity which bone shall play the sound.........&#13;
<br/><br/>
So once started it plays it infinitive times back......&#13;

My knowledge is almost at 0, but I understand in theory how it works&#13;
<br/><br/>
Take a look at this screenshot&#13;

<br/><br/>
Now what I want to do is to make the trigger move. The tension of the rope is released and the rope is moved forward, and then the bolt will also move forward with lightning speed and push the bolt (which isnt present in the screenshot) out of the crossbow&#13;
<br/><br/>
I have 2 questions:&#13;
<br/><br/>
1) my crossbow is made up of 7-8 different layers of parts ie. trigger in one layer, handle in one layer etc, do I need to combine them?&#13;
<br/>
2) How do I actually get the crossbow to behave in the above-mentioned way? Any help will be appreciated. I've been reading the tutorials, and I've heard of the motion mixer plugin and stuff like that, but I'm very confused as to how I should get myself orientated and started with this</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

I have a scene where a f-16 jet is flying through the level (animated in 3dsmax and exported to md5) and I would like to add some jet engine sounds to it that move with the jet....... just binding the speaker to the model-entity's name didn't do the trick since the entity itself is not moving .........&#13;

"f16_jet_engine" is a looped soundshader that starts to play at frame 1 and gets played by the origin bone by default.... you can also define in the entity which bone shall play the sound.........&#13;
<br/><br/>
So once started it plays it infinitive times back......&#13;

<br/><br/>
Take a look at this screenshot&#13;
<br/><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img207.echo.cx/my.php?image=crossbow1jk.jpg" target="_blank" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img207.echo.cx/img207/9454/crossbow1jk.th.jpg" border="0"/></a>&#13;
<br/><br/>
Now what I want to do is to make the trigger move. The tension of the rope is released and the rope is moved forward, and then the bolt will also move forward with lightning speed and push the bolt (which isnt present in the screenshot) out of the crossbow&#13;
<br/><br/>
I have 2 questions:&#13;
<br/><br/>
1) my crossbow is made up of 7-8 different layers of parts ie. trigger in one layer, handle in one layer etc, do I need to combine them?&#13;
<br/>
2) How do I actually get the crossbow to behave in the above-mentioned way? Any help will be appreciated. I've been reading the tutorials, and I've heard of the motion mixer plugin and stuff like that, but I'm very confused as to how I should get myself orientated and started with this</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

You don't need to, since it's an entity you can just call the sound from the animation def. An example:&#13;

"f16_jet_engine" is a looped soundshader that starts to play at frame 1 and gets played by the origin bone by default.... you can also define in the entity which bone shall play the sound.........&#13;
<br/><br/>
So once started it plays it infinitive times back......&#13;

My knowledge is almost at 0, but I understand in theory how it works&#13;
<br/><br/>
Take a look at this screenshot&#13;

<br/><br/>
Now what I want to do is to make the trigger move. The tension of the rope is released and the rope is moved forward, and then the bolt will also move forward with lightning speed and push the bolt (which isnt present in the screenshot) out of the crossbow&#13;
<br/><br/>
I have 2 questions:&#13;
<br/><br/>
1) my crossbow is made up of 7-8 different layers of parts ie. trigger in one layer, handle in one layer etc, do I need to combine them?&#13;
<br/>
2) How do I actually get the crossbow to behave in the above-mentioned way? Any help will be appreciated. I've been reading the tutorials, and I've heard of the motion mixer plugin and stuff like that, but I'm very confused as to how I should get myself orientated and started with this</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

"f16_jet_engine" is a looped soundshader that starts to play at frame 1 and gets played by the origin bone by default.... you can also define in the entity which bone shall play the sound.........&#13;
<br/><br/>
So once started it plays it infinitive times back......&#13;

<br/><br/>
Take a look at this screenshot&#13;
<br/><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img207.echo.cx/my.php?image=crossbow1jk.jpg" target="_blank" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img207.echo.cx/img207/9454/crossbow1jk.th.jpg" border="0"/></a>&#13;
<br/><br/>
Now what I want to do is to make the trigger move. The tension of the rope is released and the rope is moved forward, and then the bolt will also move forward with lightning speed and push the bolt (which isnt present in the screenshot) out of the crossbow&#13;
<br/><br/>
I have 2 questions:&#13;
<br/><br/>
1) my crossbow is made up of 7-8 different layers of parts ie. trigger in one layer, handle in one layer etc, do I need to combine them?&#13;
<br/>
2) How do I actually get the crossbow to behave in the above-mentioned way? Any help will be appreciated. I've been reading the tutorials, and I've heard of the motion mixer plugin and stuff like that, but I'm very confused as to how I should get myself orientated and started with this</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

"f16_jet_engine" is a looped soundshader that starts to play at frame 1 and gets played by the origin bone by default.... you can also define in the entity which bone shall play the sound.........&#13;
<br/><br/>
So once started it plays it infinitive times back......&#13;

Now what I want to do is to make the trigger move. The tension of the rope is released and the rope is moved forward, and then the bolt will also move forward with lightning speed and push the bolt (which isnt present in the screenshot) out of the crossbow&#13;
<br/><br/>
I have 2 questions:&#13;
<br/><br/>
1) my crossbow is made up of 7-8 different layers of parts ie. trigger in one layer, handle in one layer etc, do I need to combine them?&#13;
<br/>
2) How do I actually get the crossbow to behave in the above-mentioned way? Any help will be appreciated. I've been reading the tutorials, and I've heard of the motion mixer plugin and stuff like that, but I'm very confused as to how I should get myself orientated and started with this</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

Aside from that you'll probably need to merge all the layers aswell.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/" target="_blank" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/site/img/d3w.gif" border="0"/>  Staff</a>&#13;

Depending on how things go, we may need your help, but with us it's a case of, we have a couple of people who CAN do animations, it's just that they also have a helluva lot of models to do and don't have the time to ONLY do animations, etc. etc. We're just about to go on a bit of an "advertising campaign" searching for animators, actually.</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

"f16_jet_engine" is a looped soundshader that starts to play at frame 1 and gets played by the origin bone by default.... you can also define in the entity which bone shall play the sound.........&#13;
<br/><br/>
So once started it plays it infinitive times back......&#13;

<br/><br/>
Take a look at this screenshot&#13;
<br/><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img207.echo.cx/my.php?image=crossbow1jk.jpg" target="_blank" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img207.echo.cx/img207/9454/crossbow1jk.th.jpg" border="0"/></a>&#13;
<br/><br/>
Now what I want to do is to make the trigger move. The tension of the rope is released and the rope is moved forward, and then the bolt will also move forward with lightning speed and push the bolt (which isnt present in the screenshot) out of the crossbow&#13;
<br/><br/>
I have 2 questions:&#13;
<br/><br/>
1) my crossbow is made up of 7-8 different layers of parts ie. trigger in one layer, handle in one layer etc, do I need to combine them?&#13;
<br/>
2) How do I actually get the crossbow to behave in the above-mentioned way? Any help will be appreciated. I've been reading the tutorials, and I've heard of the motion mixer plugin and stuff like that, but I'm very confused as to how I should get myself orientated and started with this</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

You don't need to, since it's an entity you can just call the sound from the animation def. An example:&#13;

"f16_jet_engine" is a looped soundshader that starts to play at frame 1 and gets played by the origin bone by default.... you can also define in the entity which bone shall play the sound.........&#13;
<br/><br/>
So once started it plays it infinitive times back......&#13;

My knowledge is almost at 0, but I understand in theory how it works&#13;
<br/><br/>
Take a look at this screenshot&#13;

<br/><br/>
Now what I want to do is to make the trigger move. The tension of the rope is released and the rope is moved forward, and then the bolt will also move forward with lightning speed and push the bolt (which isnt present in the screenshot) out of the crossbow&#13;
<br/><br/>
I have 2 questions:&#13;
<br/><br/>
1) my crossbow is made up of 7-8 different layers of parts ie. trigger in one layer, handle in one layer etc, do I need to combine them?&#13;
<br/>
2) How do I actually get the crossbow to behave in the above-mentioned way? Any help will be appreciated. I've been reading the tutorials, and I've heard of the motion mixer plugin and stuff like that, but I'm very confused as to how I should get myself orientated and started with this</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

"f16_jet_engine" is a looped soundshader that starts to play at frame 1 and gets played by the origin bone by default.... you can also define in the entity which bone shall play the sound.........&#13;
<br/><br/>
So once started it plays it infinitive times back......&#13;
<br/><br/>
I hope this might wind up useful for other ppl aswell......<br/>_________________<br/>I got six little friends and they all run faster than you <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0"/><br/><br/>

<br/><br/>
Take a look at this screenshot&#13;
<br/><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img207.echo.cx/my.php?image=crossbow1jk.jpg" target="_blank" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img207.echo.cx/img207/9454/crossbow1jk.th.jpg" border="0"/></a>&#13;
<br/><br/>
Now what I want to do is to make the trigger move. The tension of the rope is released and the rope is moved forward, and then the bolt will also move forward with lightning speed and push the bolt (which isnt present in the screenshot) out of the crossbow&#13;
<br/><br/>
I have 2 questions:&#13;
<br/><br/>
1) my crossbow is made up of 7-8 different layers of parts ie. trigger in one layer, handle in one layer etc, do I need to combine them?&#13;
<br/>
2) How do I actually get the crossbow to behave in the above-mentioned way? Any help will be appreciated. I've been reading the tutorials, and I've heard of the motion mixer plugin and stuff like that, but I'm very confused as to how I should get myself orientated and started with this</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

I know of Maya and Max being able to do this. If Lightwave can do it then animate in that. The main thing to know is that anything you want to have animation on needs to be animated with bones. Nothing can be animated inside Doom3 with the old Quake3 method of blend verts.&#13;<br /><br />So if you wanted to have the crossbow shoot an arrow, the string needs to be animated with bones, so does the arrow and the hand pulling the trigger and whatever else.&#13;<br /><br />Within Max, the way der_ton's exporter work everything has to be a single mesh. You can't have the arrow a seperate mesh and soforth. Then it just has to be skinned and weighted on the bones you provide to animate each part. The exporter also allow you to use whatever tool is to your disposal like IK or constraints or directly animating it. All this is also possible from within Maya accept for the export to be a longer process and I don't think you have to have a single mesh. I'm sorry I have no experience with Lightwave.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p98837" date="Posted: Fri Jun 10, 2005 4:49 pm "><author>bad marine ass</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Brian mentioned this in his reply to my query&#13;<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">For the first question, it doesn't really matter a whole lot which <br />method you use to animate as long as the exported file contains only <br />bones.</div>&#13;<br /><br />Which means that the only way, the one and only way to animate, is through bones?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p98851" date="Posted: Fri Jun 10, 2005 6:44 pm "><author>obihb</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Yes.

As far as I know it was an experimental exporter made by der_ton to make it possible for easier facial animation. It's not very "game" friendly though because it generates a bone per vertex which ends up being way too much.&#13;<br /><br />The bottom line is that bones is the one and only method to animate in Doom3. Of course the scripted animation is possible on "solid" objects with simple translation and rotation that can be done, no "vertex level" animation like for characters.</div>]]></body></post><post id="93813" date="Posted: Thu May 12, 2005 11:03 am    Post subject: "><author>BloodRayne</author><body><![CDATA[<tr><td colspan="2"><span class="postbody"/><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" border="0" align="center"><tr><td><span class="genmed"><b>Rayne wrote:</b></span></td>	</tr><tr><td class="quote">&#13;

Thanks for some suggestions in advance<br/>_________________<br/>I got six little friends and they all run faster than you <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0"/><br/><br/>

You don't need to, since it's an entity you can just call the sound from the animation def. An example:&#13;

Actually I got it working by looking closer at the "cinematics.def" file a couple of hours ago..... I was just so amazed by the fact that I got it working that I forgot to post you guys ........&#13;
<br/><br/>

<br/><br/>
"f16_jet_engine" is a looped soundshader that starts to play at frame 1 and gets played by the origin bone by default.... you can also define in the entity which bone shall play the sound.........&#13;
<br/><br/>
So once started it plays it infinitive times back......&#13;

I hope this might wind up useful for other ppl aswell......<br/>_________________<br/>I got six little friends and they all run faster than you <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0"/><br/><br/>

My knowledge is almost at 0, but I understand in theory how it works&#13;
<br/><br/>
Take a look at this screenshot&#13;
<br/><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img207.echo.cx/my.php?image=crossbow1jk.jpg" target="_blank" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img207.echo.cx/img207/9454/crossbow1jk.th.jpg" border="0"/></a>&#13;
<br/><br/>
Now what I want to do is to make the trigger move. The tension of the rope is released and the rope is moved forward, and then the bolt will also move forward with lightning speed and push the bolt (which isnt present in the screenshot) out of the crossbow&#13;
<br/><br/>
I have 2 questions:&#13;
<br/><br/>
1) my crossbow is made up of 7-8 different layers of parts ie. trigger in one layer, handle in one layer etc, do I need to combine them?&#13;
<br/>
2) How do I actually get the crossbow to behave in the above-mentioned way? Any help will be appreciated. I've been reading the tutorials, and I've heard of the motion mixer plugin and stuff like that, but I'm very confused as to how I should get myself orientated and started with this</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

I have a scene where a f-16 jet is flying through the level (animated in 3dsmax and exported to md5) and I would like to add some jet engine sounds to it that move with the jet....... just binding the speaker to the model-entity's name didn't do the trick since the entity itself is not moving .........&#13;

"f16_jet_engine" is a looped soundshader that starts to play at frame 1 and gets played by the origin bone by default.... you can also define in the entity which bone shall play the sound.........&#13;

So once started it plays it infinitive times back......&#13;

<br/><br/>
Take a look at this screenshot&#13;
<br/><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img207.echo.cx/my.php?image=crossbow1jk.jpg" target="_blank" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img207.echo.cx/img207/9454/crossbow1jk.th.jpg" border="0"/></a>&#13;
<br/><br/>
Now what I want to do is to make the trigger move. The tension of the rope is released and the rope is moved forward, and then the bolt will also move forward with lightning speed and push the bolt (which isnt present in the screenshot) out of the crossbow&#13;
<br/><br/>
I have 2 questions:&#13;
<br/><br/>
1) my crossbow is made up of 7-8 different layers of parts ie. trigger in one layer, handle in one layer etc, do I need to combine them?&#13;
<br/>
2) How do I actually get the crossbow to behave in the above-mentioned way? Any help will be appreciated. I've been reading the tutorials, and I've heard of the motion mixer plugin and stuff like that, but I'm very confused as to how I should get myself orientated and started with this</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

I know of Maya and Max being able to do this. If Lightwave can do it then animate in that. The main thing to know is that anything you want to have animation on needs to be animated with bones. Nothing can be animated inside Doom3 with the old Quake3 method of blend verts.&#13;<br /><br />So if you wanted to have the crossbow shoot an arrow, the string needs to be animated with bones, so does the arrow and the hand pulling the trigger and whatever else.&#13;<br /><br />Within Max, the way der_ton's exporter work everything has to be a single mesh. You can't have the arrow a seperate mesh and soforth. Then it just has to be skinned and weighted on the bones you provide to animate each part. The exporter also allow you to use whatever tool is to your disposal like IK or constraints or directly animating it. All this is also possible from within Maya accept for the export to be a longer process and I don't think you have to have a single mesh. I'm sorry I have no experience with Lightwave.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p98837" date="Posted: Fri Jun 10, 2005 4:49 pm "><author>bad marine ass</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Brian mentioned this in his reply to my query&#13;<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">For the first question, it doesn't really matter a whole lot which <br />method you use to animate as long as the exported file contains only <br />bones.</div>&#13;<br /><br />Which means that the only way, the one and only way to animate, is through bones?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p98851" date="Posted: Fri Jun 10, 2005 6:44 pm "><author>obihb</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Yes. It has to be bones.&#13;<br /><br />Some confusion might come into some of the posts from Brian in some threads where he talks about der_ton's exporter being able to generate bones for you based on vertex movement. As far as I know it was an experimental exporter made by der_ton to make it possible for easier facial animation. It's not very "game" friendly though because it generates a bone per vertex which ends up being way too much.&#13;<br /><br />The bottom line is that bones is the one and only method to animate in Doom3. Of course the scripted animation is possible on "solid" objects with simple translation and rotation that can be done, no "vertex level" animation like for characters.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p93813" date="Posted: Thu May 12, 2005 11:03 am "><author>BloodRayne</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Rayne wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Ps: Blender it's the only free 3d app with md5 scripts that I can remember..

I've been reading the tutorials, and I've heard of the motion mixer plugin and stuff like that, but I'm very confused as to how I should get myself orientated and started with this</div>]]></body></post><post id="p97859" date="Posted: Fri Jun 03, 2005 8:53 am "><author>rich_is_bored</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Well if you have any intention of exporting that weapon to Doom 3 then you'd best forget all the special animation tools Lightwave affords you and stick to using bones because bone transformations are the only transformations that can be stored in a MD5anim.&#13;<br /><br />Aside from that you'll probably need to merge all the layers aswell.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p97957" date="Posted: Fri Jun 03, 2005 11:05 pm "><author>Brain Trepaning</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">You don't need to animate with bones to use der_ton's general MD5 exporter, but that's for 3ds Max.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p98011" date="Posted: Sat Jun 04, 2005 12:37 pm "><author>bad marine ass</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I'll be using bones for the rope, but the other movements like the bolt (that little thingy holding the rope taut) and the recoil movement of the crossbow itself, do I have to use bones too?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p98016" date="Posted: Sat Jun 04, 2005 1:27 pm "><author>der_ton</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I think it's best if you try out the process of getting an animated model from LW into D3 with an example, instead of putting lots of time into animating your model with the wrong methods, walking down a long road just to see it's a dead end.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p98026" date="Posted: Sat Jun 04, 2005 2:20 pm "><author>Fingernail</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Although we need animators (Dark Mod), we're probably not the MOST at need.

I know of Maya and Max being able to do this. If Lightwave can do it then animate in that. The main thing to know is that anything you want to have animation on needs to be animated with bones. Nothing can be animated inside Doom3 with the old Quake3 method of blend verts.&#13;<br /><br />So if you wanted to have the crossbow shoot an arrow, the string needs to be animated with bones, so does the arrow and the hand pulling the trigger and whatever else.&#13;<br /><br />Within Max, the way der_ton's exporter work everything has to be a single mesh. You can't have the arrow a seperate mesh and soforth. Then it just has to be skinned and weighted on the bones you provide to animate each part. The exporter also allow you to use whatever tool is to your disposal like IK or constraints or directly animating it. All this is also possible from within Maya accept for the export to be a longer process and I don't think you have to have a single mesh. I'm sorry I have no experience with Lightwave.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p98837" date="Posted: Fri Jun 10, 2005 4:49 pm "><author>bad marine ass</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Brian mentioned this in his reply to my query&#13;<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">For the first question, it doesn't really matter a whole lot which <br />method you use to animate as long as the exported file contains only <br />bones.</div>&#13;<br /><br />Which means that the only way, the one and only way to animate, is through bones?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p98851" date="Posted: Fri Jun 10, 2005 6:44 pm "><author>obihb</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Yes. It has to be bones.&#13;<br /><br />Some confusion might come into some of the posts from Brian in some threads where he talks about der_ton's exporter being able to generate bones for you based on vertex movement. As far as I know it was an experimental exporter made by der_ton to make it possible for easier facial animation. It's not very "game" friendly though because it generates a bone per vertex which ends up being way too much.&#13;<br /><br />The bottom line is that bones is the one and only method to animate in Doom3. Of course the scripted animation is possible on "solid" objects with simple translation and rotation that can be done, no "vertex level" animation like for characters.</div>]]></body></post><post id="98865" date="Posted: Fri Jun 10, 2005 8:36 pm    Post subject: "><author>bad marine ass</author><body><![CDATA[<tr><td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">ok that clears things up a lot, thank you all <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0"/></span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

<br/><br/>
1.) what is the optimal number (or maybe just a good target number) of bones to keep things efficent for NPC monsters and for multiplayer characters?&#13;
<br/><br/>
2.) There are some 'floating' bones on some of the Q4 monster rigs that seem to translate around, particularly on the chest of the beserker.  How are those set up? &#13;
<br/><br/>
3.) The rigs in Q4 use an inverted foot rig, should I stick to that or can I do the heel-less rig to save bones?&#13;
<br/><br/>
-Right now I'm just slamming out art for my portfolio but I would like to not back myself into a corner should I get the opportunity to get these in game.&#13;
