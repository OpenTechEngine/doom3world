<br /><br />Well, the <span style="font-weight: bold">Recall to Hell</span> team has posted a huge update <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://recalltohell.d3files.com/" class="postlink">on their website</a> yesterday, with a lot of new media about this upcoming Doom 3 mod. They've also posted a page with a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://recalltohell.d3files.com/presentation_eng.htm" class="postlink">presentation</a> for their mod, describing locations, weapons, enemies and everything else you'll find on this mod once it's released.
<br /><br />They're also taking part on Mod DB's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://awards.moddb.com/2006/" class="postlink">Mod of the Year Awards</a>.
