They were back in the days of dedicated servers, and free SDK tools, too, or was id software running a charity back then?  It's all part of the trade. Devs should know that if people are going to keep paying $50 for a title they have to provide the best offer in the box at release day, and that means lots of $$ investment. That's why that blog entry of that Manveer Heir ex raven employee reads like a long wha- wha we busted our chops for the game and people didnt buy it bitchfest, and gets no appreciation from me. You make a console game, don't expect anyone but console gamers to want it. And I think in this case, not even console gamers wanted Wolfenstein. There's plenty of game dev studios that still focus on the PC, true that they mostly appeal to more hardcore genres, but still they make good returns on the business side.</div><br />What is it that gives you this sense of entitlement? People don't <span style="font-style: italic">keep</span> paying $50, they pay $50 only <span style="font-style: italic">once</span> for a game, which covers the production, distributing, and marketing costs. I don't recall reading anywhere that devs are required to provide you with free SDK and dedicated servers; it's a thankless courtesy. Not everybody works for free, aardwolf.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">GUInterface wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">el oh el @ Wolfenstein 2009's engine looking worse than Doom 3's and not supporting UDK because it's a devilish plot created to destroy PC gaming.<br /><br />I'm not expecting any kind of logic from some people in this thread who are obviously biased towards PCs, but do you honestly believe that video game developers wanting money is anything new?</div><br />GUI, don't waste your time making that argument here.

I mean, they gave the MP part to some guys nobody knows (endrant - wtf). They made a horrible job. maybe the community could have dne some improvements IF they released the SDK when Wolfenstein came out.<br />The singleplayer isn't good, too. They got some cool missions and stuff (cool music, the idea of the vail is nice, but most of the time useless and boring), but the whole interface sucks with its big buttons, useless "game tips" and so on. Feels all like a really cheap port from Xbox/playstation. for example look at the farm mission: the outdoor graphics are horrible (level backgrounds look like a 10 year old game with all those low-res bitmap trees). The mapping sucks, invisible walls etc.<br />There are good missions (although it's just straight forward scripted with not much gameplay freedom) and some bosses/enemies are nice. But they fail a lot. The normal soldier can be killed with 2 shots, they aim really bad etc.. feels like made for gamepad and autoaim. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320002703im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><br /><br />^^just some random thoughts about the game <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320002703im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p225341" date="Posted: Tue Jul 06, 2010 6:55 pm "><author>Neurological</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">drill_sarge wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">Neurological wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><span style="font-weight: bold">ex</span> community menager Peter Sokal</div><br />?<br />he was fired or what?<br /><br /></div><br /><br />He said on the forums that he moved to another job.

I mean, they gave the MP part to some guys nobody knows (endrant - wtf). They made a horrible job. maybe the community could have dne some improvements IF they released the SDK when Wolfenstein came out.<br />The singleplayer isn't good, too. They got some cool missions and stuff (cool music, the idea of the vail is nice, but most of the time useless and boring), but the whole interface sucks with its big buttons, useless "game tips" and so on. Feels all like a really cheap port from Xbox/playstation. for example look at the farm mission: the outdoor graphics are horrible (level backgrounds look like a 10 year old game with all those low-res bitmap trees). The mapping sucks, invisible walls etc.<br />There are good missions (although it's just straight forward scripted with not much gameplay freedom) and some bosses/enemies are nice. But they fail a lot. The normal soldier can be killed with 2 shots, they aim really bad etc.. feels like made for gamepad and autoaim. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320003354im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><br /><br />^^just some random thoughts about the game <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320003354im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p225341" date="Posted: Tue Jul 06, 2010 6:55 pm "><author>Neurological</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">drill_sarge wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">Neurological wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><span style="font-weight: bold">ex</span> community menager Peter Sokal</div><br />?<br />he was fired or what?<br /><br /></div><br /><br />He said on the forums that he moved to another job.

They were back in the days of dedicated servers, and free SDK tools, too, or was id software running a charity back then?  It's all part of the trade. Devs should know that if people are going to keep paying $50 for a title they have to provide the best offer in the box at release day, and that means lots of $$ investment. That's why that blog entry of that Manveer Heir ex raven employee reads like a long wha- wha we busted our chops for the game and people didnt buy it bitchfest, and gets no appreciation from me. You make a console game, don't expect anyone but console gamers to want it. And I think in this case, not even console gamers wanted Wolfenstein. There's plenty of game dev studios that still focus on the PC, true that they mostly appeal to more hardcore genres, but still they make good returns on the business side.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p225811" date="Posted: Mon Jul 26, 2010 2:52 pm "><author>=FF=Sturm</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">reko... it's not just a head.

They were back in the days of dedicated servers, and free SDK tools, too, or was id software running a charity back then?  It's all part of the trade. Devs should know that if people are going to keep paying $50 for a title they have to provide the best offer in the box at release day, and that means lots of $$ investment. That's why that blog entry of that Manveer Heir ex raven employee reads like a long wha- wha we busted our chops for the game and people didnt buy it bitchfest, and gets no appreciation from me. You make a console game, don't expect anyone but console gamers to want it. And I think in this case, not even console gamers wanted Wolfenstein. There's plenty of game dev studios that still focus on the PC, true that they mostly appeal to more hardcore genres, but still they make good returns on the business side.</div><br />What is it that gives you this sense of entitlement? People don't <span style="font-style: italic">keep</span> paying $50, they pay $50 only <span style="font-style: italic">once</span> for a game, which covers the production, distributing, and marketing costs. I don't recall reading anywhere that devs are required to provide you with free SDK and dedicated servers; it's a thankless courtesy. Not everybody works for free, aardwolf.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">GUInterface wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">el oh el @ Wolfenstein 2009's engine looking worse than Doom 3's and not supporting UDK because it's a devilish plot created to destroy PC gaming.<br /><br />I'm not expecting any kind of logic from some people in this thread who are obviously biased towards PCs, but do you honestly believe that video game developers wanting money is anything new?</div><br />GUI, don't waste your time making that argument here.

They were back in the days of dedicated servers, and free SDK tools, too, or was id software running a charity back then?  It's all part of the trade. Devs should know that if people are going to keep paying $50 for a title they have to provide the best offer in the box at release day, and that means lots of $$ investment. That's why that blog entry of that Manveer Heir ex raven employee reads like a long wha- wha we busted our chops for the game and people didnt buy it bitchfest, and gets no appreciation from me. You make a console game, don't expect anyone but console gamers to want it. And I think in this case, not even console gamers wanted Wolfenstein. There's plenty of game dev studios that still focus on the PC, true that they mostly appeal to more hardcore genres, but still they make good returns on the business side.</div><br />What is it that gives you this sense of entitlement? People don't <span style="font-style: italic">keep</span> paying $50, they pay $50 only <span style="font-style: italic">once</span> for a game, which covers the production, distributing, and marketing costs. I don't recall reading anywhere that devs are required to provide you with free SDK and dedicated servers; it's a thankless courtesy. Not everybody works for free, aardwolf.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">GUInterface wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">el oh el @ Wolfenstein 2009's engine looking worse than Doom 3's and not supporting UDK because it's a devilish plot created to destroy PC gaming.<br /><br />I'm not expecting any kind of logic from some people in this thread who are obviously biased towards PCs, but do you honestly believe that video game developers wanting money is anything new?</div><br />GUI, don't waste your time making that argument here.

I mean, they gave the MP part to some guys nobody knows (endrant - wtf). They made a horrible job. maybe the community could have dne some improvements IF they released the SDK when Wolfenstein came out.<br />The singleplayer isn't good, too. They got some cool missions and stuff (cool music, the idea of the vail is nice, but most of the time useless and boring), but the whole interface sucks with its big buttons, useless "game tips" and so on. Feels all like a really cheap port from Xbox/playstation. for example look at the farm mission: the outdoor graphics are horrible (level backgrounds look like a 10 year old game with all those low-res bitmap trees). The mapping sucks, invisible walls etc.<br />There are good missions (although it's just straight forward scripted with not much gameplay freedom) and some bosses/enemies are nice. But they fail a lot. The normal soldier can be killed with 2 shots, they aim really bad etc.. feels like made for gamepad and autoaim. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320003354im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><br /><br />^^just some random thoughts about the game <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320003354im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p225341" date="Posted: Tue Jul 06, 2010 6:55 pm "><author>Neurological</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">drill_sarge wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">Neurological wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><span style="font-weight: bold">ex</span> community menager Peter Sokal</div><br />?<br />he was fired or what?<br /><br /></div><br /><br />He said on the forums that he moved to another job.

They were back in the days of dedicated servers, and free SDK tools, too, or was id software running a charity back then?  It's all part of the trade. Devs should know that if people are going to keep paying $50 for a title they have to provide the best offer in the box at release day, and that means lots of $$ investment. That's why that blog entry of that Manveer Heir ex raven employee reads like a long wha- wha we busted our chops for the game and people didnt buy it bitchfest, and gets no appreciation from me. You make a console game, don't expect anyone but console gamers to want it. And I think in this case, not even console gamers wanted Wolfenstein. There's plenty of game dev studios that still focus on the PC, true that they mostly appeal to more hardcore genres, but still they make good returns on the business side.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p225811" date="Posted: Mon Jul 26, 2010 2:52 pm "><author>=FF=Sturm</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">reko... it's not just a head.

They were back in the days of dedicated servers, and free SDK tools, too, or was id software running a charity back then?  It's all part of the trade. Devs should know that if people are going to keep paying $50 for a title they have to provide the best offer in the box at release day, and that means lots of $$ investment. That's why that blog entry of that Manveer Heir ex raven employee reads like a long wha- wha we busted our chops for the game and people didnt buy it bitchfest, and gets no appreciation from me. You make a console game, don't expect anyone but console gamers to want it. And I think in this case, not even console gamers wanted Wolfenstein. There's plenty of game dev studios that still focus on the PC, true that they mostly appeal to more hardcore genres, but still they make good returns on the business side.</div><br />What is it that gives you this sense of entitlement? People don't <span style="font-style: italic">keep</span> paying $50, they pay $50 only <span style="font-style: italic">once</span> for a game, which covers the production, distributing, and marketing costs. I don't recall reading anywhere that devs are required to provide you with free SDK and dedicated servers; it's a thankless courtesy. Not everybody works for free, aardwolf.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">GUInterface wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">el oh el @ Wolfenstein 2009's engine looking worse than Doom 3's and not supporting UDK because it's a devilish plot created to destroy PC gaming.<br /><br />I'm not expecting any kind of logic from some people in this thread who are obviously biased towards PCs, but do you honestly believe that video game developers wanting money is anything new?</div><br />GUI, don't waste your time making that argument here.

Cry Engine 1 to be more precise.   It's pretty awesome despite being old.  There are some mods that make it look better than Crysis.  Check them at moddb.  Some of them are amazing.

I mean, they gave the MP part to some guys nobody knows (endrant - wtf). They made a horrible job. maybe the community could have dne some improvements IF they released the SDK when Wolfenstein came out.<br />The singleplayer isn't good, too. They got some cool missions and stuff (cool music, the idea of the vail is nice, but most of the time useless and boring), but the whole interface sucks with its big buttons, useless "game tips" and so on. Feels all like a really cheap port from Xbox/playstation. for example look at the farm mission: the outdoor graphics are horrible (level backgrounds look like a 10 year old game with all those low-res bitmap trees). The mapping sucks, invisible walls etc.<br />There are good missions (although it's just straight forward scripted with not much gameplay freedom) and some bosses/enemies are nice. But they fail a lot. The normal soldier can be killed with 2 shots, they aim really bad etc.. feels like made for gamepad and autoaim. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320003354im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><br /><br />^^just some random thoughts about the game <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320003354im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p225341" date="Posted: Tue Jul 06, 2010 6:55 pm "><author>Neurological</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">drill_sarge wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">Neurological wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><span style="font-weight: bold">ex</span> community menager Peter Sokal</div><br />?<br />he was fired or what?<br /><br /></div><br /><br />He said on the forums that he moved to another job.

They were back in the days of dedicated servers, and free SDK tools, too, or was id software running a charity back then?  It's all part of the trade. Devs should know that if people are going to keep paying $50 for a title they have to provide the best offer in the box at release day, and that means lots of $$ investment. That's why that blog entry of that Manveer Heir ex raven employee reads like a long wha- wha we busted our chops for the game and people didnt buy it bitchfest, and gets no appreciation from me. You make a console game, don't expect anyone but console gamers to want it. And I think in this case, not even console gamers wanted Wolfenstein. There's plenty of game dev studios that still focus on the PC, true that they mostly appeal to more hardcore genres, but still they make good returns on the business side.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p225811" date="Posted: Mon Jul 26, 2010 2:52 pm "><author>=FF=Sturm</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">reko... it's not just a head.

They were back in the days of dedicated servers, and free SDK tools, too, or was id software running a charity back then?  It's all part of the trade. Devs should know that if people are going to keep paying $50 for a title they have to provide the best offer in the box at release day, and that means lots of $$ investment. That's why that blog entry of that Manveer Heir ex raven employee reads like a long wha- wha we busted our chops for the game and people didnt buy it bitchfest, and gets no appreciation from me. You make a console game, don't expect anyone but console gamers to want it. And I think in this case, not even console gamers wanted Wolfenstein. There's plenty of game dev studios that still focus on the PC, true that they mostly appeal to more hardcore genres, but still they make good returns on the business side.</div><br />What is it that gives you this sense of entitlement? People don't <span style="font-style: italic">keep</span> paying $50, they pay $50 only <span style="font-style: italic">once</span> for a game, which covers the production, distributing, and marketing costs. I don't recall reading anywhere that devs are required to provide you with free SDK and dedicated servers; it's a thankless courtesy. Not everybody works for free, aardwolf.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">GUInterface wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">el oh el @ Wolfenstein 2009's engine looking worse than Doom 3's and not supporting UDK because it's a devilish plot created to destroy PC gaming.<br /><br />I'm not expecting any kind of logic from some people in this thread who are obviously biased towards PCs, but do you honestly believe that video game developers wanting money is anything new?</div><br />GUI, don't waste your time making that argument here.
