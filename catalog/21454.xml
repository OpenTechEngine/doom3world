(Which kat did not, I was the one that went nuts... <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081118090931im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />)<br /><br />Anyway, I don't know much about RTCW, but from what I've heard, there is another one in the making. I suspect if that's true they would probably release more info at QuakeCon. Not to mention more Rage info. At QuakeCon '07 they said that more info would trickle in about Rage in the following months, but I don't think it did.<br /><br />Even so, I'll be looking forward to the four day long party with all kinds of free stuff. Every year since '06 I prayed that I would get called up for a Quake 4 Quick Draw tourney (I'm pretty good at Q4), but I never get raffled. It sucks because most people that get called for the Q4 Quick Draw have NEVER played Quake, so they suck <span style="font-style: italic">bad</span>. You basically get 1 thousand dollars for going up and pwning some n00b who never played the game. And at the final party you can risk your 1 grand for 2 grand by playing another match, and I would totally do that. (Why not go all out?)<br /><br />QuakeCon is like a four day party. Regardless of the announcements made, you're going to have a good time.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p197952" date="Posted: Wed Apr 23, 2008 7:23 pm "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Another year where I don't have the time to attend.

I'm gonna tell you anyways!  I'd love it if they were to announce at least hints on the editing of the newer games.  Are the new titles going to use roughly the same assets as the previous tech-4 titles?  What about map editing?  Just anything to indicate that it may just be possible to begin working on Rage assets now, as it might just use the same old normalmaps and meshes that Doom3 does, you know what I mean?  I don't see the big deal in announcing such things for the sake of the modding community that may want to get straight to work on things now, whatever the consequences.<br />For example, if I knew I could make some Quake 3 Arena map that would be "portable" to Doom3 I may have been inclined to start on a singleplayer map in the post-Q3A lull.  Maybe there's a bunch of reasons why it just doesn't work this way and why they wouldn't announce such technical details about their unreleased games, but it'd be nice to feel more confident about it rather than waiting for the moment it's released just to find out it's a revamped version of the Doom3 engine all over again.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p197981" date="Posted: Thu Apr 24, 2008 1:56 am "><author>The Happy Friar</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">it's that date because it's a thursday-friday-saturday event &amp; it's normally the first or second week in august.<br /><br />BTW, I'm vibrating in place.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081118090931im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081118090931im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081118090931im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081118090931im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081118090931im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081118090931im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p197987" date="Posted: Thu Apr 24, 2008 3:50 am "><author>revility</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I suspect allot of do overs were done for wolf2 considering they announced and show concepts for a long time ago.<br /><br />There will be no wolf2.

Quake Live beta may launch at QuakeCon (if not sooner), for the LAN. If not for the testing of LAN features, then for the LAN and the fans at least. They did it with QW beta last year (it was the beta 2 I think).<br /><br />I think RTCW2 - or 3, or Wolf2 or 3, or whatever - could quite possibly been shown. It's just been so long since we've seen anything, years. You'd figure they would have a lot done by now. I wouldn't doubt that they idea hopped in the middle of development, but I really don't think they're still in the concepting stages today.<br /><br />I don't know. It just seems most likely we'll see some Wolfenstein related stuff, but we won't know until QuakeCon.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p198017" date="Posted: Thu Apr 24, 2008 4:31 pm "><author>pbmax</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">we better see some wolfenstein stuff. its been 2.5 years since they announced it and there have been reports that id/raven/activision are targeting a 2008 release.<br /><br />i did a trademark search and nothing comes up for the new wolfenstein game. they sould have trademarked something by now. here's the link. just search for "id software" with "owner name &amp; address" selected.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081118090931/http://tess2.uspto.gov/bin/gate.exe?f=searchss&amp;state=f6l7uo.1.1">http://tess2.uspto.gov/bin/gate.exe?f=s ... f6l7uo.1.1</a><!-- m --><br /><br />its also coming out on the xbox360 first by the way...</div>]]></body></post><post id="p198024" date="Posted: Thu Apr 24, 2008 5:43 pm "><author>The Happy Friar</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">pbmax wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">its been 2.5 years since they announced it and there have been reports that id/raven/activision are targeting a 2008 release.</div><br /><br />wasn't that an ACCIDENTAL announcement too?

It's very frustrating. Whenever Carmack breaks cover and decides to speak it's always news - but it's not very often these days that he does.<br /><br />I dunno - it seems idTech4, as much as we all love it, never was the 'next big thing' for id (U3Engine seems to have pretty much cleaned up the market in its wake, though I'm not a huge fan, tbh). Maybe it's got the folks at id cowed.<br /><br />ET:QW comes out soon on 360 here in the UK. I'm hoping that might lead to a resurgence of interest in whatever id's up to at the moment on all platforms. We'll see.

(Which kat did not, I was the one that went nuts... <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081118042123im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />)<br /><br />Anyway, I don't know much about RTCW, but from what I've heard, there is another one in the making. I suspect if that's true they would probably release more info at QuakeCon. Not to mention more Rage info. At QuakeCon '07 they said that more info would trickle in about Rage in the following months, but I don't think it did.<br /><br />Even so, I'll be looking forward to the four day long party with all kinds of free stuff. Every year since '06 I prayed that I would get called up for a Quake 4 Quick Draw tourney (I'm pretty good at Q4), but I never get raffled. It sucks because most people that get called for the Q4 Quick Draw have NEVER played Quake, so they suck <span style="font-style: italic">bad</span>. You basically get 1 thousand dollars for going up and pwning some n00b who never played the game. And at the final party you can risk your 1 grand for 2 grand by playing another match, and I would totally do that. (Why not go all out?)<br /><br />QuakeCon is like a four day party. Regardless of the announcements made, you're going to have a good time.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p197952" date="Posted: Wed Apr 23, 2008 7:23 pm "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Another year where I don't have the time to attend.

I'm gonna tell you anyways!  I'd love it if they were to announce at least hints on the editing of the newer games.  Are the new titles going to use roughly the same assets as the previous tech-4 titles?  What about map editing?  Just anything to indicate that it may just be possible to begin working on Rage assets now, as it might just use the same old normalmaps and meshes that Doom3 does, you know what I mean?  I don't see the big deal in announcing such things for the sake of the modding community that may want to get straight to work on things now, whatever the consequences.<br />For example, if I knew I could make some Quake 3 Arena map that would be "portable" to Doom3 I may have been inclined to start on a singleplayer map in the post-Q3A lull.  Maybe there's a bunch of reasons why it just doesn't work this way and why they wouldn't announce such technical details about their unreleased games, but it'd be nice to feel more confident about it rather than waiting for the moment it's released just to find out it's a revamped version of the Doom3 engine all over again.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p197981" date="Posted: Thu Apr 24, 2008 1:56 am "><author>The Happy Friar</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">it's that date because it's a thursday-friday-saturday event &amp; it's normally the first or second week in august.<br /><br />BTW, I'm vibrating in place.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081118042123im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081118042123im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081118042123im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081118042123im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081118042123im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081118042123im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p197987" date="Posted: Thu Apr 24, 2008 3:50 am "><author>revility</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I suspect allot of do overs were done for wolf2 considering they announced and show concepts for a long time ago.<br /><br />There will be no wolf2.

Quake Live beta may launch at QuakeCon (if not sooner), for the LAN. If not for the testing of LAN features, then for the LAN and the fans at least. They did it with QW beta last year (it was the beta 2 I think).<br /><br />I think RTCW2 - or 3, or Wolf2 or 3, or whatever - could quite possibly been shown. It's just been so long since we've seen anything, years. You'd figure they would have a lot done by now. I wouldn't doubt that they idea hopped in the middle of development, but I really don't think they're still in the concepting stages today.<br /><br />I don't know.

It's very frustrating. Whenever Carmack breaks cover and decides to speak it's always news - but it's not very often these days that he does.<br /><br />I dunno - it seems idTech4, as much as we all love it, never was the 'next big thing' for id (U3Engine seems to have pretty much cleaned up the market in its wake, though I'm not a huge fan, tbh). Maybe it's got the folks at id cowed.<br /><br />ET:QW comes out soon on 360 here in the UK.
