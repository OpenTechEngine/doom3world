One of the big ones right now is the shadowing system, for starters. While I think Carmack made the right choice circa 2004, shadow maps are currently a vastly superior option for shadows and would enable a number of additional optimizations like GPU-based skinning and memexport/stream out/transform feedback for all skinned meshes. On top of that you'd probably be able to save a lot of fillrate just by switching over.<br /><br />Also, id tech 4 (from what I can tell) likely would not scale well to large, (reasonably) dynamic environments. AFAIK the visibility culling system (PVS w/ portals) was also dropped outright in favor of some sort of hierarchal occlusion culling system. Streaming also seems like it would be a fantastic pain in the ass, especially considering the rather long load times present in D3. Then again, I'm a pretty big drinker of the Megatexture brand Kool-Aid.<br /><br />That's not to say any of the above couldn't be implemented in id tech 4, too. Much of the engine wars are phenominal marketing bullshit anyway.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p228156" date="Posted: Tue Nov 02, 2010 11:30 pm "><author>Kamikazee</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Not to downplay your achievement, but could you dial back the effect's strength?

Aside from the 'glprogs' folder, it seems all that's required to make POM work is a local map and its reference in the material shader, no different than usual.

A quick way to do this is to download Policapo's relief mapping mod and use the normal2depth.exe to process all of (well, most of, really) D3's textures.

I opened up the texture files for the "dent" material. The local map and the alpha channel from the specular map both indicate a square-ish hole in the middle of the texture. In-game, however, it shows the square as a bump/extrusion. Here's what I mean:<br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225032659/http://img254.imageshack.us/i/shot00007hq.jpg/" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225032659im_/http://img254.imageshack.us/img254/5126/shot00007hq.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br />To be more accurate: the surrounding area is receding, rather than the middle square. Why is that? The other materials seem to be behaving correctly (assuming darker values = lower level, right?).</div>]]></body></post><post id="p228915" date="Posted: Sun Dec 19, 2010 3:03 am "><author>Sikkpin</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">evilartist wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">...darker values = lower level, right?).</div>Right.

One of the big ones right now is the shadowing system, for starters. While I think Carmack made the right choice circa 2004, shadow maps are currently a vastly superior option for shadows and would enable a number of additional optimizations like GPU-based skinning and memexport/stream out/transform feedback for all skinned meshes. On top of that you'd probably be able to save a lot of fillrate just by switching over.<br /><br />Also, id tech 4 (from what I can tell) likely would not scale well to large, (reasonably) dynamic environments. AFAIK the visibility culling system (PVS w/ portals) was also dropped outright in favor of some sort of hierarchal occlusion culling system. Streaming also seems like it would be a fantastic pain in the ass, especially considering the rather long load times present in D3. Then again, I'm a pretty big drinker of the Megatexture brand Kool-Aid.<br /><br />That's not to say any of the above couldn't be implemented in id tech 4, too. Much of the engine wars are phenominal marketing bullshit anyway.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p228156" date="Posted: Tue Nov 02, 2010 11:30 pm "><author>Kamikazee</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Not to downplay your achievement, but could you dial back the effect's strength?

Overall this is an amazing new feature. I don't think even Brink uses it. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225032659im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />BTW: RipOutTheWings...

Aside from the 'glprogs' folder, it seems all that's required to make POM work is a local map and its reference in the material shader, no different than usual. With that said, POM doesn't seem to work with any of Doom 3's vanilla assets. Are the vanilla textures missing a requirement that I overlooked with your test textures?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p228913" date="Posted: Sun Dec 19, 2010 2:07 am "><author>Sikkpin</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">evilartist wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">...Are the vanilla textures missing a requirement that I overlooked with your test textures?</div><br />Yes, there needs to be a height map in the specular maps alpha channel. A quick way to do this is to download Policapo's relief mapping mod and use the normal2depth.exe to process all of (well, most of, really) D3's textures.

I opened up the texture files for the "dent" material. The local map and the alpha channel from the specular map both indicate a square-ish hole in the middle of the texture. In-game, however, it shows the square as a bump/extrusion. Here's what I mean:<br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225032659/http://img254.imageshack.us/i/shot00007hq.jpg/" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225032659im_/http://img254.imageshack.us/img254/5126/shot00007hq.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br />To be more accurate: the surrounding area is receding, rather than the middle square. Why is that? The other materials seem to be behaving correctly (assuming darker values = lower level, right?).</div>]]></body></post><post id="p228915" date="Posted: Sun Dec 19, 2010 3:03 am "><author>Sikkpin</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">evilartist wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">...darker values = lower level, right?).</div>Right. The texture on the floor is actually "bump", the ceiling texture is "dent". <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225032659im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post></posts></thread></xml>
