Apple cares about the user experience and that's something other companies always seem to overlook in favor of bloat. Personally my dream phone is an N95, but I can easily see why iPhone is doing so well. It's really an amazing phone even if the specs doesn't reflect that.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p193182" date="Posted: Wed Dec 26, 2007 6:24 pm "><author>Daniel Schimmer</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Haha!

I'm considering getting opera for my DS (when it's replaced). Would be very handy to have web-access on the go.  Would love if I could get a PDA for ~$150 that could do that.  <img src="/web/20071227193927im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p193199" date="Posted: Thu Dec 27, 2007 5:03 pm "><author>Jack Rammsdell</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><a href="/web/20071227193927/http://www.speakeasy.net/speedtest/" class="postlink">http://www.speakeasy.net/speedtest/</a><br /><br />I am curious of the bandwith myself, I plan on getting one.

UMTS or HDSPA would have been fine of course, but I typically need a quick info somewhere which most often is just googling something. I also tried browsing and Google earth in EDGE mode and it's all acceptable - given that you're out in the wild. Purchasing music from iTunes is out of the question without a wi-fi hotspot.<br /><br />It keeps me connected to the basic needs I have, even youtube stuff streams in acceptable. There are competitive solutions from other phone companies, but they lack the strange effect to feel better after purchasing an steeply priced Mac product.</div>]]></body></post></posts></thread></xml>
