<br/><br/>
To acheive this I used this material file:&#13;

If you were to look at the texture located in my "lights" dir, you would see a completely black texture, the alpha map applied to it is what determines what shadow is projected.&#13;
<br/><br/>
The outcome is this:&#13;
<br/><img src="/web/20061013023753im_/http://www.filefarmer.com/cb/shadow.jpg" border="0"/><br/>
In this scene there are two lights, one is the sky light eluminating the map, and the other is the one projecting the shadow. &#13;
<br/><br/>
I'd be interested in any possible usage ideas for this that any of you might have, it seems there are very few. <img src="/web/20061013023753im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0"/><br/>_________________<br/>1+1= 11</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

Are you splitting up your brushes? I get a framerate of about 20 fps if I have just 9 lights hitting the same large surface, but then the Radeon 9800 XT is not exactly a top-of-the-range graphics card (although it's perfectly decent even for todays games).</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

Its better to think of them as texture projectors rather than lights (They do however get projected from lights), so they don't have the same slowdowns that normal lighting does (IE- They don't cast any light, stencil shadows, or specular highlights. They only cast a texture). To clarify I tested the 80 "Projector" map on two large connected surfaces with no splitting (Aside from the split that was due to me being to lazy to connect the two large surfaces). I'm also running on a Radeon 9800 (Pro), so its not like I have some super-computer. <img src="/web/20061013023753im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0"/><br/>_________________<br/>1+1= 11</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>
