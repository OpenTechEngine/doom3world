It's fully textured, skinned, and I can put it into Quake using the MD5 exporter provided by der_ton. Problem is, when I put the character into the engine, the player is twice as large as the Player Character Model.<br /><br />I've scanned the forums for dead threads and none of them seem to help me remedy this problem. I understand that scaling bones is a big "no-no" so I've already got the bones set up to where they're the exact same size as the player.md5anim files. Scaling the character to match that doesn't seem to work, but for some reason, scaling the mesh down then binding the bones to it will shrink it.<br /><br />Also, if it makes any difference, I'm using Max 9 and the most recent md5 exporter from der_ton.<br /><br />If anyone could please help me with this, that would be greatly appreciated.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p207276" date="Posted: Fri Nov 07, 2008 12:03 pm "><author>der_ton</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">There is a program called md5scale that might help:<br /><!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="/web/20081113215820/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=15967">viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=15967</a><!-- l --><br /><!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="/web/20081113215820/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=21510">viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=21510</a><!-- l --><br />Sorry for this late reply, but I just stumbled over that by chance and remembered this thread.
