It's just so unmotivating to work on old stuff  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081120192729im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" alt=":|" title="Neutral" /> . By the way, what's going on with your Q4 sp map? Any progress or still on hold?<br /><br />@heXum: Thanks, much appreciated <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081120192729im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> I know what you mean, I don't play Q4 either and everytime a download a new multiplayer map I just jump through it for a couple of minutes and delete it afterwards.<br /><br />Thanks again guys for your kind words. Btw, I've uploaded some bigger screenshots, in case anyone is interested:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081120192729/http://www.bja-design.de/poprocks.htm">http://www.bja-design.de/poprocks.htm</a><!-- m --></div>]]></body></post><post id="p184678" date="Posted: Sun Jul 29, 2007 5:57 pm "><author>Jack Rammsdell</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">BJA wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">@Jack Rammsdell: I hope you liked the maps before the prey city level also <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081120192729im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div><br /><br />That was just the first map I saw of yours that really got my attention.</div>]]></body></post></posts></thread></xml>
