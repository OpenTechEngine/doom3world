<br />these can be loaded in the most 3d app's
<br />it only converts the mesh and not the joints of the md5mesh file
<br /><br />drag and drop a md5mesh file on the md5mesh2obj.exe or start it in a commandwindow with the md5mesh file as parameter

Is the utility supposed to export the proper skin/material file as well?

<br />(because their is no unique nameconvention of the textures of all models their is no other way) 
<br />also, some models include not only the "rendermesh" also some other meshes, often without textures
<br />also, it depends what the program does into which you load the obj's, whether it support the materials, ....</div>]]></body></post><post id="p34662" date="Posted: Fri Aug 13, 2004 10:29 am "><author>Hell Byte</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Ah ok, i was wondering about those extra meshes as well. For instance the arch vile loads up with an extra set of hands, this is intended? What are the extra meshes used for btw?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p34692" date="Posted: Fri Aug 13, 2004 11:41 am "><author>bozo</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">this is very different for each model,
<br />some does not have extrameshes, but others have some, ie. der_ton mentioned about simplified shadowmeshes, some models have a rendermesh for a skeleton, that are show when enemy is killed, ...</div>]]></body></post></posts></thread></xml>
