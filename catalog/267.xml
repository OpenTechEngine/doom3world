<br />I looked into some of the camera stuff today but i cant get any of it to work. It looks to me like some external tools were used (outside the editor).

<br /><br />but how bout a tut on how to take what you know how to do... and getting more milage out of it.
<br /><br />It would be cool to make a map with various cool features, and then show what you used for where... and why... that sorta thing. It would be cool to see a tut more on the artistic side of mapping rather than a technical "this is how you do this" tutorial.
<br /><br />Lets face it... alot of mappers (me included) are artistically deprived. The doom mod community would definately appreciate some tuts on adding "style" to a map</div>]]></body></post><post id="p2181" date="Posted: Thu Nov 21, 2002 9:33 am "><author>3dioot</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Ophd,
<br /><br />You are very right about that. I doubt that im the right person for that though. Ive been doing 3d (offline rendering) for awhile now but im pretty new to mapping. Go here: 
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320010824/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=245">http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=245</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />Many experienced mappers replied and it helped me alot. The best thing i can advise you is to look at the existing maps. You are trying to replicate the real world (even if its set in the future its still this real human world we are talking about) so try to abide to its rules. Build everything to scale, place fence's where you could fall and hurt yourself, place lights where you need to see a command panel or instrument, place small lights on the stairsteps or on the ground in a dark hallway so you will see where you have to put your feet and so on and so on. If you make everything serve a purpose you are halfway there. What also really helps is the decal's that you are able to use now. You can dirty stuff up. It can be machinery, the floor that is walked over alot, a wall that is open to air or wind or corrosion of any kind. Also try to work in layers. Layers of depth. Instead of having a clear see through from one end of the room to the other place stuff in your line of sight. I know it sounds kinda weird but this is really quite important. It can be flat planes with a grate texture or cables, a few simple boxes, a big pipe, a column. Try to make it big when you just start on your level. Your room has to look interesting to walk around in even before you start detailing. (i did that wrong in my level and im sorry now) Start with support structures. A ceiling wont stay up by itself. Neither will the walls. And use trims on everything. (that kinda falls into detailing). But really, 'finish' the geometry. A trim makes something solid. Makes it look like its build and strong. Its edge will be protected. If you dont use trims it will just look like the geometry is carved out of something solid. (at least thats my experience) Also the trims in d3 with the normal mapping will give nice bevelled edges to your geometry that catch highlights. Very cool!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320010824im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />  The other half of level building is your idea where you want to go with the level, what should be in there.

Two thoughts spring to mind:
<br /><br />1.  Smoke, flame throwers etc. as i saw recently when i was poking around the page for Quake3 Fortress (a damn dandy mod if ever i have seen one).  Check out this page of their "look what we did":
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320010824/http://www.q3f.com/shots_inprogress.html">http://www.q3f.com/shots_inprogress.html</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />2.  A recent movie on Everquest 2 was showing off different things that next-gen tech can do.  I am not a EQ fan but i like next gen tech.  I was not terribly impressed overall (D3 looks much better <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320010824im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />) but in the movie there is a excerpt about about what they have done with the particle engine and there is some really clever stuff.  The movie can be downloaded from fileplanet (if you are a registered user) but i don't know where else to look for it.

<br /><br />Anyway, it would be nice to see tutorials on how to do some more outlandish stuff with the particles too.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p9987" date="Posted: Sat Jul 19, 2003 1:18 am "><author>bullet</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">elevators!! and how about one on lights, like how to use fog effectively so you don't just have a big cube of fog, which looks horrible if you're outside it. and maybe one on vis portals?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p10015" date="Posted: Sat Jul 19, 2003 2:08 pm "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">bullet wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">elevators!! and how about one on lights, like how to use fog effectively so you don't just have a big cube of fog, which looks horrible if you're outside it. and maybe one on vis portals?</div>

<br /><br />Over a year and a half ago I downloaded the alpha. I toyed with it for a few days but while i was impressed with it's capablities, I quickly became bored with the content that was packaged with it. I wanted to make my own.
<br /><br />I found this site and while it had plenty of information it had nothing in the scripting section. I made a post about the sections lack of posts and how someone should write a tutorial. No one responded.
<br /><br />Instead of waiting for someone else to show me, I experimented with scripting commands and figured it out myself. Once I had a good understanding of how it worked, I wrote three tutorials on the subject.
<br /><br />I shared what I learned and I've recieved more positive comments than I ever expected. The funny thing is I am no different than any of you.
<br /><br />So, if you don't know how to do something and you can't find any help here, don't sit on the sidelines and wait for someone to write a tutorial. Toy with the alpha and figure it out, then document what you've learned. You'll gain tons of respect from the community and you can expect the same positive feedback from me.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p18182" date="Posted: Thu Feb 05, 2004 5:31 pm "><author>bullet</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">you do have a point. well, more than one, but that doesn't make up for your first point being a good one  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320010824im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />so far my process has been: Think up something neat to do in a level. Figure out how it works (if it works somewhere else somehow, even in reality, that helps). Trial &amp; Error all over the place. Eureka! Overuse new 'cool thing' to the point my computer makes odd noises. 
<br />I've been making more and more complex levels as I go. so far I haven't done anything that no one else knows how to do (that I know of), but my ideas are getting to be pretty far out there and I think I'll be doing a few things some time in the next couple of weeks that nobody's done before.

If you say you want to host stuff right now im all for it but i assume thats out of the question  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224230815im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /><br /><br />GrtZ 3dioot

<br />I looked into some of the camera stuff today but i cant get any of it to work. It looks to me like some external tools were used (outside the editor).

<br /><br />It would be cool to make a map with various cool features, and then show what you used for where... and why... that sorta thing. It would be cool to see a tut more on the artistic side of mapping rather than a technical "this is how you do this" tutorial.

<br /><br />Many experienced mappers replied and it helped me alot. The best thing i can advise you is to look at the existing maps. You are trying to replicate the real world (even if its set in the future its still this real human world we are talking about) so try to abide to its rules. Build everything to scale, place fence's where you could fall and hurt yourself, place lights where you need to see a command panel or instrument, place small lights on the stairsteps or on the ground in a dark hallway so you will see where you have to put your feet and so on and so on. If you make everything serve a purpose you are halfway there. What also really helps is the decal's that you are able to use now. You can dirty stuff up. It can be machinery, the floor that is walked over alot, a wall that is open to air or wind or corrosion of any kind. Also try to work in layers. Layers of depth. Instead of having a clear see through from one end of the room to the other place stuff in your line of sight. I know it sounds kinda weird but this is really quite important. It can be flat planes with a grate texture or cables, a few simple boxes, a big pipe, a column. Try to make it big when you just start on your level. Your room has to look interesting to walk around in even before you start detailing. (i did that wrong in my level and im sorry now) Start with support structures. A ceiling wont stay up by itself. Neither will the walls. And use trims on everything. (that kinda falls into detailing). But really, 'finish' the geometry. A trim makes something solid. Makes it look like its build and strong. Its edge will be protected. If you dont use trims it will just look like the geometry is carved out of something solid. (at least thats my experience) Also the trims in d3 with the normal mapping will give nice bevelled edges to your geometry that catch highlights. Very cool!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224230815im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />  The other half of level building is your idea where you want to go with the level, what should be in there.

Two thoughts spring to mind:
<br /><br />1.  Smoke, flame throwers etc. as i saw recently when i was poking around the page for Quake3 Fortress (a damn dandy mod if ever i have seen one).  Check out this page of their "look what we did":

<br /><br />2.  A recent movie on Everquest 2 was showing off different things that next-gen tech can do.  I am not a EQ fan but i like next gen tech.  I was not terribly impressed overall (D3 looks much better <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224230815im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />) but in the movie there is a excerpt about about what they have done with the particle engine and there is some really clever stuff.  The movie can be downloaded from fileplanet (if you are a registered user) but i don't know where else to look for it.

<br /><br />Over a year and a half ago I downloaded the alpha. I toyed with it for a few days but while i was impressed with it's capablities, I quickly became bored with the content that was packaged with it. I wanted to make my own.
<br /><br />I found this site and while it had plenty of information it had nothing in the scripting section. I made a post about the sections lack of posts and how someone should write a tutorial. No one responded.
<br /><br />Instead of waiting for someone else to show me, I experimented with scripting commands and figured it out myself. Once I had a good understanding of how it worked, I wrote three tutorials on the subject.
<br /><br />I shared what I learned and I've recieved more positive comments than I ever expected. The funny thing is I am no different than any of you.
<br /><br />So, if you don't know how to do something and you can't find any help here, don't sit on the sidelines and wait for someone to write a tutorial. Toy with the alpha and figure it out, then document what you've learned. You'll gain tons of respect from the community and you can expect the same positive feedback from me.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p18182" date="Posted: Thu Feb 05, 2004 5:31 pm "><author>bullet</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">you do have a point. well, more than one, but that doesn't make up for your first point being a good one  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224230815im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />so far my process has been: Think up something neat to do in a level.

<br />basicly, the way i think of it is, each (rectangular) brush has six sides to it, but you normally only ever see one of those sides. i.e. one inside wall.
<br />the way i understand caulk to work is, its applied to every face of the brush you cant see, otherwise the engine will be rendering it anyway, and using up processing power.
<br />the way i approach caulking is to highlight All my brushes in a room, batch treat them with the caulk texture. i then go into the room in the cam view, and highlight the brush "faces" (i.e. hold down ctrl + shift while clicking on the inside of a wall) you should see only one face highlighted, i.e. a 2d plane. i highlight all of these( that i can see through the cam view, as i know anything i can see through this view can be seen in the room) and apply new texture to it. 
<br /><br />if that isn't clear enough i will write a tutorial up, with pics if i can too!!!

<br /><br />But, the engine does a great job of removing unseen faces during the compile process. Infact, the compiler does such a great job that there's no need for any kind of hint texture what so ever.
<br /><br />All caulk does is seal leaks, much like it's real world counterpart.
<br /><br />For instance, patches do not seal your level from the void. To counter this you place a brush textured with caulk behind the patch to close the "hole".
<br /><br />Mblackwell, If you can understand the concepts laid out in this post, then congratulations, you've just completed the caulk tutorial.
<br /><br />And if you don't understand what the void or leaks are then a general introduction to mapping with id engine games is in order. You can find that here...

You basically just weld verts together to make less faces. Like lets say you had a flat square area that is subdevided a certain amount of times. The optimal way of having it would be two triangles right?. So you'd basically take all the extra vertices and weld them into the four main corners of the square leaving two tris as the result.
<br /><br />That's a good way I can think of to describe the low poly optimising. Taking that same approuch to any other model like a character you'll quickly see where you can kill polygons that are not contributing to the overall shape of the model.
<br /><br />You get the auto poly reduction in Max aswell called Multires. This modifier will reduce poly's for you based on your input for percentage or whatever. It's not the best way of doing it though since it can make for a very messy model in the end. In some cases it's useful though.
<br /><br />Building really high poly models and then reducing them in poly count for the game is not a great idea. It's alot of extra work. I usually just make the high poly and then build the low poly around it, it's much faster and leaves a cleaner low poly mesh in the end.
<br /><br />When you do alot of low poly models you get used to how much you can spend in certain areas without really doing too much optimising later. It's like anything else really, the more you do it the better you get.
<br /><br />I think I'm just used to keeping an eye on poly count because I've done so many models for games. It's pretty important to keep to certain poly counts for whatever game you make models.

<br /><br />I don't think I've ever seen a flickering light texture, only flickering light entities.
<br /><br />Also, I find it impossible to choose a flickering sound to match the light. I know each flicker has a sort of 'pattern' to it, but no sounds seem to match them, which is confusing, as I've seen (and heard) all of the lights in the id levels in perfect synch.
<br /><br />Now obviously, I'm not going to ask for each light flicker and any matching sounds, just for a way to synch sounds and flickers.
<br /><br />And I have searched, numerous times, with no answers.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p132587" date="Posted: Wed Feb 08, 2006 8:08 am "><author>rich_is_bored</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">@Irishlostboy1980:
<br /><br />I know there are some key/value pairs that you can assign to enemies to affect their behavior. I'm also pretty sure you can control how they behave in your level by using clip textures and entity paths.

<br /><br />You see, there isn't a material shader for water bundled with the game. But once you make one it's as simple as dragging out a brush to represent the volume of water and texturing it with the material you created.
<br /><br />The material keyword "water" is all that's needed to make the material liquid.
<br /><br />A good read...

<br /><br />It would be cool to make a map with various cool features, and then show what you used for where... and why... that sorta thing. It would be cool to see a tut more on the artistic side of mapping rather than a technical "this is how you do this" tutorial.

<br /><br />You are very right about that. I doubt that im the right person for that though. Ive been doing 3d (offline rendering) for awhile now but im pretty new to mapping. Go here: 
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="viewtopic.php?t=245">http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=245</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />Many experienced mappers replied and it helped me alot. The best thing i can advise you is to look at the existing maps. You are trying to replicate the real world (even if its set in the future its still this real human world we are talking about) so try to abide to its rules. Build everything to scale, place fence's where you could fall and hurt yourself, place lights where you need to see a command panel or instrument, place small lights on the stairsteps or on the ground in a dark hallway so you will see where you have to put your feet and so on and so on. If you make everything serve a purpose you are halfway there. What also really helps is the decal's that you are able to use now. You can dirty stuff up. It can be machinery, the floor that is walked over alot, a wall that is open to air or wind or corrosion of any kind. Also try to work in layers. Layers of depth. Instead of having a clear see through from one end of the room to the other place stuff in your line of sight. I know it sounds kinda weird but this is really quite important. It can be flat planes with a grate texture or cables, a few simple boxes, a big pipe, a column. Try to make it big when you just start on your level. Your room has to look interesting to walk around in even before you start detailing. (i did that wrong in my level and im sorry now) Start with support structures. A ceiling wont stay up by itself. Neither will the walls. And use trims on everything. (that kinda falls into detailing). But really, 'finish' the geometry. A trim makes something solid. Makes it look like its build and strong. Its edge will be protected. If you dont use trims it will just look like the geometry is carved out of something solid. (at least thats my experience) Also the trims in d3 with the normal mapping will give nice bevelled edges to your geometry that catch highlights. Very cool!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320010800im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />  The other half of level building is your idea where you want to go with the level, what should be in there.

Two thoughts spring to mind:
<br /><br />1.  Smoke, flame throwers etc. as i saw recently when i was poking around the page for Quake3 Fortress (a damn dandy mod if ever i have seen one).  Check out this page of their "look what we did":

<br /><br />2.  A recent movie on Everquest 2 was showing off different things that next-gen tech can do.  I am not a EQ fan but i like next gen tech.  I was not terribly impressed overall (D3 looks much better <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320010800im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />) but in the movie there is a excerpt about about what they have done with the particle engine and there is some really clever stuff.  The movie can be downloaded from fileplanet (if you are a registered user) but i don't know where else to look for it.

<br /><br />Over a year and a half ago I downloaded the alpha. I toyed with it for a few days but while i was impressed with it's capablities, I quickly became bored with the content that was packaged with it. I wanted to make my own.
<br /><br />I found this site and while it had plenty of information it had nothing in the scripting section. I made a post about the sections lack of posts and how someone should write a tutorial. No one responded.
<br /><br />Instead of waiting for someone else to show me, I experimented with scripting commands and figured it out myself. Once I had a good understanding of how it worked, I wrote three tutorials on the subject.
<br /><br />I shared what I learned and I've recieved more positive comments than I ever expected. The funny thing is I am no different than any of you.
<br /><br />So, if you don't know how to do something and you can't find any help here, don't sit on the sidelines and wait for someone to write a tutorial. Toy with the alpha and figure it out, then document what you've learned. You'll gain tons of respect from the community and you can expect the same positive feedback from me.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p18182" date="Posted: Thu Feb 05, 2004 5:31 pm "><author>bullet</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">you do have a point. well, more than one, but that doesn't make up for your first point being a good one  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320010800im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />so far my process has been: Think up something neat to do in a level.

<br />basicly, the way i think of it is, each (rectangular) brush has six sides to it, but you normally only ever see one of those sides. i.e. one inside wall.
<br />the way i understand caulk to work is, its applied to every face of the brush you cant see, otherwise the engine will be rendering it anyway, and using up processing power.
<br />the way i approach caulking is to highlight All my brushes in a room, batch treat them with the caulk texture. i then go into the room in the cam view, and highlight the brush "faces" (i.e. hold down ctrl + shift while clicking on the inside of a wall) you should see only one face highlighted, i.e. a 2d plane. i highlight all of these( that i can see through the cam view, as i know anything i can see through this view can be seen in the room) and apply new texture to it. 
<br /><br />if that isn't clear enough i will write a tutorial up, with pics if i can too!!!

<br /><br />But, the engine does a great job of removing unseen faces during the compile process. Infact, the compiler does such a great job that there's no need for any kind of hint texture what so ever.
<br /><br />All caulk does is seal leaks, much like it's real world counterpart.
<br /><br />For instance, patches do not seal your level from the void. To counter this you place a brush textured with caulk behind the patch to close the "hole".
<br /><br />Mblackwell, If you can understand the concepts laid out in this post, then congratulations, you've just completed the caulk tutorial.
<br /><br />And if you don't understand what the void or leaks are then a general introduction to mapping with id engine games is in order. You can find that here...

You basically just weld verts together to make less faces. Like lets say you had a flat square area that is subdevided a certain amount of times. The optimal way of having it would be two triangles right?. So you'd basically take all the extra vertices and weld them into the four main corners of the square leaving two tris as the result.
<br /><br />That's a good way I can think of to describe the low poly optimising. Taking that same approuch to any other model like a character you'll quickly see where you can kill polygons that are not contributing to the overall shape of the model.
<br /><br />You get the auto poly reduction in Max aswell called Multires. This modifier will reduce poly's for you based on your input for percentage or whatever. It's not the best way of doing it though since it can make for a very messy model in the end. In some cases it's useful though.
<br /><br />Building really high poly models and then reducing them in poly count for the game is not a great idea. It's alot of extra work. I usually just make the high poly and then build the low poly around it, it's much faster and leaves a cleaner low poly mesh in the end.
<br /><br />When you do alot of low poly models you get used to how much you can spend in certain areas without really doing too much optimising later. It's like anything else really, the more you do it the better you get.
<br /><br />I think I'm just used to keeping an eye on poly count because I've done so many models for games. It's pretty important to keep to certain poly counts for whatever game you make models. It's basically become a habit for me to model and optimise.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p112017" date="Posted: Thu Sep 08, 2005 10:09 pm "><author>irishlostboy1980</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">yea, i have to try use vertice weld more. gotta try wrap my models properly round the back and weld them together. so much to learn, so little time.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320005950im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_cry.gif" alt=":cry:" title="Crying or Very sad" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p121989" date="Posted: Fri Nov 18, 2005 8:19 am "><author>Sebazzz</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I'd like to request a tutorial for flikkering texture lights.

<br /><br />I don't think I've ever seen a flickering light texture, only flickering light entities.
<br /><br />Also, I find it impossible to choose a flickering sound to match the light. I know each flicker has a sort of 'pattern' to it, but no sounds seem to match them, which is confusing, as I've seen (and heard) all of the lights in the id levels in perfect synch.
<br /><br />Now obviously, I'm not going to ask for each light flicker and any matching sounds, just for a way to synch sounds and flickers.
<br /><br />And I have searched, numerous times, with no answers.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p132587" date="Posted: Wed Feb 08, 2006 8:08 am "><author>rich_is_bored</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">@Irishlostboy1980:

<br /><br />It would be cool to make a map with various cool features, and then show what you used for where... and why... that sorta thing. It would be cool to see a tut more on the artistic side of mapping rather than a technical "this is how you do this" tutorial.
<br /><br />Lets face it... alot of mappers (me included) are artistically deprived.

<br /><br />You are very right about that. I doubt that im the right person for that though. Ive been doing 3d (offline rendering) for awhile now but im pretty new to mapping. Go here: 
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="viewtopic.php?t=245">http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=245</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />Many experienced mappers replied and it helped me alot. The best thing i can advise you is to look at the existing maps. You are trying to replicate the real world (even if its set in the future its still this real human world we are talking about) so try to abide to its rules. Build everything to scale, place fence's where you could fall and hurt yourself, place lights where you need to see a command panel or instrument, place small lights on the stairsteps or on the ground in a dark hallway so you will see where you have to put your feet and so on and so on. If you make everything serve a purpose you are halfway there. What also really helps is the decal's that you are able to use now. You can dirty stuff up. It can be machinery, the floor that is walked over alot, a wall that is open to air or wind or corrosion of any kind. Also try to work in layers. Layers of depth. Instead of having a clear see through from one end of the room to the other place stuff in your line of sight. I know it sounds kinda weird but this is really quite important. It can be flat planes with a grate texture or cables, a few simple boxes, a big pipe, a column. Try to make it big when you just start on your level. Your room has to look interesting to walk around in even before you start detailing. (i did that wrong in my level and im sorry now) Start with support structures. A ceiling wont stay up by itself. Neither will the walls. And use trims on everything. (that kinda falls into detailing). But really, 'finish' the geometry. A trim makes something solid. Makes it look like its build and strong. Its edge will be protected. If you dont use trims it will just look like the geometry is carved out of something solid. (at least thats my experience) Also the trims in d3 with the normal mapping will give nice bevelled edges to your geometry that catch highlights. Very cool!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />  The other half of level building is your idea where you want to go with the level, what should be in there.

Two thoughts spring to mind:
<br /><br />1.  Smoke, flame throwers etc. as i saw recently when i was poking around the page for Quake3 Fortress (a damn dandy mod if ever i have seen one).  Check out this page of their "look what we did":

<br /><br />2.  A recent movie on Everquest 2 was showing off different things that next-gen tech can do.  I am not a EQ fan but i like next gen tech.  I was not terribly impressed overall (D3 looks much better <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />) but in the movie there is a excerpt about about what they have done with the particle engine and there is some really clever stuff.  The movie can be downloaded from fileplanet (if you are a registered user) but i don't know where else to look for it.

<br /><br />Over a year and a half ago I downloaded the alpha. I toyed with it for a few days but while i was impressed with it's capablities, I quickly became bored with the content that was packaged with it. I wanted to make my own.
<br /><br />I found this site and while it had plenty of information it had nothing in the scripting section. I made a post about the sections lack of posts and how someone should write a tutorial. No one responded.
<br /><br />Instead of waiting for someone else to show me, I experimented with scripting commands and figured it out myself. Once I had a good understanding of how it worked, I wrote three tutorials on the subject.
<br /><br />I shared what I learned and I've recieved more positive comments than I ever expected. The funny thing is I am no different than any of you.
<br /><br />So, if you don't know how to do something and you can't find any help here, don't sit on the sidelines and wait for someone to write a tutorial. Toy with the alpha and figure it out, then document what you've learned. You'll gain tons of respect from the community and you can expect the same positive feedback from me.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p18182" date="Posted: Thu Feb 05, 2004 4:31 pm "><author>bullet</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">you do have a point. well, more than one, but that doesn't make up for your first point being a good one  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />so far my process has been: Think up something neat to do in a level. Figure out how it works (if it works somewhere else somehow, even in reality, that helps). Trial &amp; Error all over the place. Eureka! Overuse new 'cool thing' to the point my computer makes odd noises. 
<br />I've been making more and more complex levels as I go. so far I haven't done anything that no one else knows how to do (that I know of), but my ideas are getting to be pretty far out there and I think I'll be doing a few things some time in the next couple of weeks that nobody's done before.

						<div class="postbody">Hm, i like the tutorial idea. I thought about compiling everything i know in one big text file but i kinda shied away from that because its probably illegal and i didnt like putting a lot of effort into something that i cant freely distribute to help others. I would love to write some tutorials exclusively for doom3world but if people cant read it now it probably will be outdated by the time the game ships. Not that it wont be usefull, but it WILL be old and less precise then when it would be for immediate use. Im afraid the gap between now and shipping date is a bit too big. If you say you want to host stuff right now im all for it but i assume thats out of the question  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /><br /><br />GrtZ 3dioot
<br /><br /><br />PS
<br />I looked into some of the camera stuff today but i cant get any of it to work. It looks to me like some external tools were used (outside the editor). I can get a camera to run in my level but it isnt saved with it and im not able to trigger it either.</div>

						<div class="postbody">most tutorials are just about implementing engine features... and that is fine if you just want to learn how to implement more features.
<br /><br />but how bout a tut on how to take what you know how to do... and getting more milage out of it.
<br /><br />It would be cool to make a map with various cool features, and then show what you used for where... and why... that sorta thing. It would be cool to see a tut more on the artistic side of mapping rather than a technical "this is how you do this" tutorial.
<br /><br />Lets face it... alot of mappers (me included) are artistically deprived. The doom mod community would definately appreciate some tuts on adding "style" to a map</div>

						<div class="postbody">Ophd,
<br /><br />You are very right about that. I doubt that im the right person for that though. Ive been doing 3d (offline rendering) for awhile now but im pretty new to mapping. Go here:

<br /><br />Many experienced mappers replied and it helped me alot. The best thing i can advise you is to look at the existing maps. You are trying to replicate the real world (even if its set in the future its still this real human world we are talking about) so try to abide to its rules. Build everything to scale, place fence's where you could fall and hurt yourself, place lights where you need to see a command panel or instrument, place small lights on the stairsteps or on the ground in a dark hallway so you will see where you have to put your feet and so on and so on. If you make everything serve a purpose you are halfway there. What also really helps is the decal's that you are able to use now. You can dirty stuff up. It can be machinery, the floor that is walked over alot, a wall that is open to air or wind or corrosion of any kind. Also try to work in layers. Layers of depth. Instead of having a clear see through from one end of the room to the other place stuff in your line of sight. I know it sounds kinda weird but this is really quite important. It can be flat planes with a grate texture or cables, a few simple boxes, a big pipe, a column. Try to make it big when you just start on your level. Your room has to look interesting to walk around in even before you start detailing. (i did that wrong in my level and im sorry now) Start with support structures. A ceiling wont stay up by itself. Neither will the walls. And use trims on everything. (that kinda falls into detailing). But really, 'finish' the geometry. A trim makes something solid. Makes it look like its build and strong. Its edge will be protected. If you dont use trims it will just look like the geometry is carved out of something solid. (at least thats my experience) Also the trims in d3 with the normal mapping will give nice bevelled edges to your geometry that catch highlights. Very cool!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />  The other half of level building is your idea where you want to go with the level, what should be in there.

						<div class="postbody">Just a thought, but it would be nice to see not just the basic particles (like those seen in e3_3) but also other dandy things people come up with to do with particles.  Two thoughts spring to mind:
<br /><br />1.  Smoke, flame throwers etc. as i saw recently when i was poking around the page for Quake3 Fortress (a damn dandy mod if ever i have seen one).  Check out this page of their "look what we did":
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.q3f.com/shots_inprogress.html">http://www.q3f.com/shots_inprogress.html</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />2.  A recent movie on Everquest 2 was showing off different things that next-gen tech can do.  I am not a EQ fan but i like next gen tech.  I was not terribly impressed overall (D3 looks much better <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />) but in the movie there is a excerpt about about what they have done with the particle engine and there is some really clever stuff.  The movie can be downloaded from fileplanet (if you are a registered user) but i don't know where else to look for it.
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.fileplanet.com/files/110000/117121.shtml">http://www.fileplanet.com/files/110000/117121.shtml</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />Anyway, it would be nice to see tutorials on how to do some more outlandish stuff with the particles too.</div>

						<div class="postbody">All jokes aside, let me tell you a little story...
<br /><br />Over a year and a half ago I downloaded the alpha. I toyed with it for a few days but while i was impressed with it's capablities, I quickly became bored with the content that was packaged with it. I wanted to make my own.
<br /><br />I found this site and while it had plenty of information it had nothing in the scripting section. I made a post about the sections lack of posts and how someone should write a tutorial. No one responded.
<br /><br />Instead of waiting for someone else to show me, I experimented with scripting commands and figured it out myself. Once I had a good understanding of how it worked, I wrote three tutorials on the subject.
<br /><br />I shared what I learned and I've recieved more positive comments than I ever expected. The funny thing is I am no different than any of you.
<br /><br />So, if you don't know how to do something and you can't find any help here, don't sit on the sidelines and wait for someone to write a tutorial. Toy with the alpha and figure it out, then document what you've learned. You'll gain tons of respect from the community and you can expect the same positive feedback from me.</div>

						<div class="postbody">you do have a point. well, more than one, but that doesn't make up for your first point being a good one  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />so far my process has been: Think up something neat to do in a level. Figure out how it works (if it works somewhere else somehow, even in reality, that helps). Trial &amp; Error all over the place. Eureka! Overuse new 'cool thing' to the point my computer makes odd noises. 
<br />I've been making more and more complex levels as I go. so far I haven't done anything that no one else knows how to do (that I know of), but my ideas are getting to be pretty far out there and I think I'll be doing a few things some time in the next couple of weeks that nobody's done before. If I actually understand what makes it work (if it works) then I'll start a thread on it!</div>

Infact, the compiler does such a great job that there's no need for any kind of hint texture what so ever.&#13;<br /><br />All caulk does is seal leaks, much like it's real world counterpart.&#13;<br /><br />For instance, patches do not seal your level from the void. To counter this you place a brush textured with caulk behind the patch to close the "hole".&#13;<br /><br />Mblackwell, If you can understand the concepts laid out in this post, then congratulations, you've just completed the caulk tutorial.&#13;<br /><br />And if you don't understand what the void or leaks are then a general introduction to mapping with id engine games is in order.

Basically just on a brush that you need to act as a normal brush without getting rendered, like to patch up a hole behind a patch mesh for one example.&#13;<br /><br />The example you gave of a room and caulking the outer faces is not true. You do not have to caulk those faces since the map compiler discards those polygons automatically.

You basically just weld verts together to make less faces. Like lets say you had a flat square area that is subdevided a certain amount of times. The optimal way of having it would be two triangles right?. So you'd basically take all the extra vertices and weld them into the four main corners of the square leaving two tris as the result.&#13;<br /><br />That's a good way I can think of to describe the low poly optimising. Taking that same approuch to any other model like a character you'll quickly see where you can kill polygons that are not contributing to the overall shape of the model.&#13;<br /><br />You get the auto poly reduction in Max aswell called Multires. This modifier will reduce poly's for you based on your input for percentage or whatever. It's not the best way of doing it though since it can make for a very messy model in the end. In some cases it's useful though.&#13;<br /><br />Building really high poly models and then reducing them in poly count for the game is not a great idea. It's alot of extra work. I usually just make the high poly and then build the low poly around it, it's much faster and leaves a cleaner low poly mesh in the end.&#13;<br /><br />When you do alot of low poly models you get used to how much you can spend in certain areas without really doing too much optimising later. It's like anything else really, the more you do it the better you get.&#13;<br /><br />I think I'm just used to keeping an eye on poly count because I've done so many models for games. It's pretty important to keep to certain poly counts for whatever game you make models. It's basically become a habit for me to model and optimise.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p112017" date="Posted: Thu Sep 08, 2005 9:09 pm "><author>irishlostboy1980</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">yea, i have to try use vertice weld more. gotta try wrap my models properly round the back and weld them together. so much to learn, so little time.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_cry.gif" alt=":cry:" title="Crying or Very sad" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p121989" date="Posted: Fri Nov 18, 2005 7:19 am "><author>Sebazzz</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I'd like to request a tutorial for flikkering texture lights.&#13;<br />I don't really get it so...</div>]]></body></post><post id="p132519" date="Posted: Tue Feb 07, 2006 3:40 pm "><author>irishlostboy1980</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">hey all. has anyone got a good tutorial on placing and using enemies properly? making them do as they are told? all i know about putting enemies into a map is sticking them in. they kinda do there own thing. which is  invariably run at me from all over the map. &#13;<br />any help in this respect would be greatly appreciated.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p132555" date="Posted: Tue Feb 07, 2006 9:32 pm "><author>Skul</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Sebazzz wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I'd like to request a tutorial for flikkering texture lights.<br />I don't really get it so...</div>&#13;<br /><br />I don't think I've ever seen a flickering light texture, only flickering light entities.&#13;<br /><br />Also, I find it impossible to choose a flickering sound to match the light.

<br /><br />Many experienced mappers replied and it helped me alot. The best thing i can advise you is to look at the existing maps. You are trying to replicate the real world (even if its set in the future its still this real human world we are talking about) so try to abide to its rules. Build everything to scale, place fence's where you could fall and hurt yourself, place lights where you need to see a command panel or instrument, place small lights on the stairsteps or on the ground in a dark hallway so you will see where you have to put your feet and so on and so on. If you make everything serve a purpose you are halfway there. What also really helps is the decal's that you are able to use now. You can dirty stuff up. It can be machinery, the floor that is walked over alot, a wall that is open to air or wind or corrosion of any kind. Also try to work in layers. Layers of depth. Instead of having a clear see through from one end of the room to the other place stuff in your line of sight. I know it sounds kinda weird but this is really quite important. It can be flat planes with a grate texture or cables, a few simple boxes, a big pipe, a column. Try to make it big when you just start on your level. Your room has to look interesting to walk around in even before you start detailing. (i did that wrong in my level and im sorry now) Start with support structures. A ceiling wont stay up by itself. Neither will the walls. And use trims on everything. (that kinda falls into detailing). But really, 'finish' the geometry. A trim makes something solid. Makes it look like its build and strong. Its edge will be protected. If you dont use trims it will just look like the geometry is carved out of something solid. (at least thats my experience) Also the trims in d3 with the normal mapping will give nice bevelled edges to your geometry that catch highlights. Very cool!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320010800im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />  The other half of level building is your idea where you want to go with the level, what should be in there.

Two thoughts spring to mind:
<br /><br />1.  Smoke, flame throwers etc. as i saw recently when i was poking around the page for Quake3 Fortress (a damn dandy mod if ever i have seen one).  Check out this page of their "look what we did":

<br /><br />2.  A recent movie on Everquest 2 was showing off different things that next-gen tech can do.  I am not a EQ fan but i like next gen tech.  I was not terribly impressed overall (D3 looks much better <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320010800im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />) but in the movie there is a excerpt about about what they have done with the particle engine and there is some really clever stuff.  The movie can be downloaded from fileplanet (if you are a registered user) but i don't know where else to look for it.

<br /><br />Over a year and a half ago I downloaded the alpha. I toyed with it for a few days but while i was impressed with it's capablities, I quickly became bored with the content that was packaged with it. I wanted to make my own.
<br /><br />I found this site and while it had plenty of information it had nothing in the scripting section. I made a post about the sections lack of posts and how someone should write a tutorial. No one responded.
<br /><br />Instead of waiting for someone else to show me, I experimented with scripting commands and figured it out myself. Once I had a good understanding of how it worked, I wrote three tutorials on the subject.
<br /><br />I shared what I learned and I've recieved more positive comments than I ever expected. The funny thing is I am no different than any of you.
<br /><br />So, if you don't know how to do something and you can't find any help here, don't sit on the sidelines and wait for someone to write a tutorial. Toy with the alpha and figure it out, then document what you've learned. You'll gain tons of respect from the community and you can expect the same positive feedback from me.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p18182" date="Posted: Thu Feb 05, 2004 5:31 pm "><author>bullet</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">you do have a point. well, more than one, but that doesn't make up for your first point being a good one  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320010800im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />so far my process has been: Think up something neat to do in a level.

<br />basicly, the way i think of it is, each (rectangular) brush has six sides to it, but you normally only ever see one of those sides. i.e. one inside wall.
<br />the way i understand caulk to work is, its applied to every face of the brush you cant see, otherwise the engine will be rendering it anyway, and using up processing power.
<br />the way i approach caulking is to highlight All my brushes in a room, batch treat them with the caulk texture. i then go into the room in the cam view, and highlight the brush "faces" (i.e. hold down ctrl + shift while clicking on the inside of a wall) you should see only one face highlighted, i.e. a 2d plane. i highlight all of these( that i can see through the cam view, as i know anything i can see through this view can be seen in the room) and apply new texture to it. 
<br /><br />if that isn't clear enough i will write a tutorial up, with pics if i can too!!!

<br /><br />But, the engine does a great job of removing unseen faces during the compile process. Infact, the compiler does such a great job that there's no need for any kind of hint texture what so ever.
<br /><br />All caulk does is seal leaks, much like it's real world counterpart.
<br /><br />For instance, patches do not seal your level from the void. To counter this you place a brush textured with caulk behind the patch to close the "hole".
<br /><br />Mblackwell, If you can understand the concepts laid out in this post, then congratulations, you've just completed the caulk tutorial.
<br /><br />And if you don't understand what the void or leaks are then a general introduction to mapping with id engine games is in order. You can find that here...

You basically just weld verts together to make less faces. Like lets say you had a flat square area that is subdevided a certain amount of times. The optimal way of having it would be two triangles right?. So you'd basically take all the extra vertices and weld them into the four main corners of the square leaving two tris as the result.
<br /><br />That's a good way I can think of to describe the low poly optimising. Taking that same approuch to any other model like a character you'll quickly see where you can kill polygons that are not contributing to the overall shape of the model.
<br /><br />You get the auto poly reduction in Max aswell called Multires. This modifier will reduce poly's for you based on your input for percentage or whatever. It's not the best way of doing it though since it can make for a very messy model in the end. In some cases it's useful though.
<br /><br />Building really high poly models and then reducing them in poly count for the game is not a great idea. It's alot of extra work. I usually just make the high poly and then build the low poly around it, it's much faster and leaves a cleaner low poly mesh in the end.
<br /><br />When you do alot of low poly models you get used to how much you can spend in certain areas without really doing too much optimising later. It's like anything else really, the more you do it the better you get.
<br /><br />I think I'm just used to keeping an eye on poly count because I've done so many models for games. It's pretty important to keep to certain poly counts for whatever game you make models. It's basically become a habit for me to model and optimise.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p112017" date="Posted: Thu Sep 08, 2005 10:09 pm "><author>irishlostboy1980</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">yea, i have to try use vertice weld more. gotta try wrap my models properly round the back and weld them together. so much to learn, so little time.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320005950im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_cry.gif" alt=":cry:" title="Crying or Very sad" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p121989" date="Posted: Fri Nov 18, 2005 8:19 am "><author>Sebazzz</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I'd like to request a tutorial for flikkering texture lights.

<br /><br />I don't think I've ever seen a flickering light texture, only flickering light entities.
<br /><br />Also, I find it impossible to choose a flickering sound to match the light. I know each flicker has a sort of 'pattern' to it, but no sounds seem to match them, which is confusing, as I've seen (and heard) all of the lights in the id levels in perfect synch.
<br /><br />Now obviously, I'm not going to ask for each light flicker and any matching sounds, just for a way to synch sounds and flickers.
<br /><br />And I have searched, numerous times, with no answers.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p89890" date="Posted: Thu Apr 21, 2005 6:26 pm "><author>voldemort</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">As far as water effects go Its mainly the texture you use.

You basically just weld verts together to make less faces. Like lets say you had a flat square area that is subdevided a certain amount of times. The optimal way of having it would be two triangles right?. So you'd basically take all the extra vertices and weld them into the four main corners of the square leaving two tris as the result.&#13;<br /><br />That's a good way I can think of to describe the low poly optimising. Taking that same approuch to any other model like a character you'll quickly see where you can kill polygons that are not contributing to the overall shape of the model.&#13;<br /><br />You get the auto poly reduction in Max aswell called Multires. This modifier will reduce poly's for you based on your input for percentage or whatever. It's not the best way of doing it though since it can make for a very messy model in the end. In some cases it's useful though.&#13;<br /><br />Building really high poly models and then reducing them in poly count for the game is not a great idea. It's alot of extra work. I usually just make the high poly and then build the low poly around it, it's much faster and leaves a cleaner low poly mesh in the end.&#13;<br /><br />When you do alot of low poly models you get used to how much you can spend in certain areas without really doing too much optimising later. It's like anything else really, the more you do it the better you get.&#13;<br /><br />I think I'm just used to keeping an eye on poly count because I've done so many models for games. It's pretty important to keep to certain poly counts for whatever game you make models. It's basically become a habit for me to model and optimise.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p112017" date="Posted: Thu Sep 08, 2005 9:09 pm "><author>irishlostboy1980</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">yea, i have to try use vertice weld more. gotta try wrap my models properly round the back and weld them together. so much to learn, so little time.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_cry.gif" alt=":cry:" title="Crying or Very sad" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p121989" date="Posted: Fri Nov 18, 2005 7:19 am "><author>Sebazzz</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I'd like to request a tutorial for flikkering texture lights.&#13;<br />I don't really get it so...</div>]]></body></post><post id="p132519" date="Posted: Tue Feb 07, 2006 3:40 pm "><author>irishlostboy1980</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">hey all. has anyone got a good tutorial on placing and using enemies properly? making them do as they are told? all i know about putting enemies into a map is sticking them in. they kinda do there own thing. which is  invariably run at me from all over the map. &#13;<br />any help in this respect would be greatly appreciated.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p132555" date="Posted: Tue Feb 07, 2006 9:32 pm "><author>Skul</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Sebazzz wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I'd like to request a tutorial for flikkering texture lights.<br />I don't really get it so...</div>&#13;<br /><br />I don't think I've ever seen a flickering light texture, only flickering light entities.&#13;<br /><br />Also, I find it impossible to choose a flickering sound to match the light.

<br /><br />It would be cool to make a map with various cool features, and then show what you used for where... and why... that sorta thing. It would be cool to see a tut more on the artistic side of mapping rather than a technical "this is how you do this" tutorial.
<br /><br />Lets face it... alot of mappers (me included) are artistically deprived.

<br /><br />You are very right about that. I doubt that im the right person for that though. Ive been doing 3d (offline rendering) for awhile now but im pretty new to mapping. Go here: 
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="viewtopic.php?t=245">http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=245</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />Many experienced mappers replied and it helped me alot. The best thing i can advise you is to look at the existing maps. You are trying to replicate the real world (even if its set in the future its still this real human world we are talking about) so try to abide to its rules. Build everything to scale, place fence's where you could fall and hurt yourself, place lights where you need to see a command panel or instrument, place small lights on the stairsteps or on the ground in a dark hallway so you will see where you have to put your feet and so on and so on. If you make everything serve a purpose you are halfway there. What also really helps is the decal's that you are able to use now. You can dirty stuff up. It can be machinery, the floor that is walked over alot, a wall that is open to air or wind or corrosion of any kind. Also try to work in layers. Layers of depth. Instead of having a clear see through from one end of the room to the other place stuff in your line of sight. I know it sounds kinda weird but this is really quite important. It can be flat planes with a grate texture or cables, a few simple boxes, a big pipe, a column. Try to make it big when you just start on your level. Your room has to look interesting to walk around in even before you start detailing. (i did that wrong in my level and im sorry now) Start with support structures. A ceiling wont stay up by itself. Neither will the walls. And use trims on everything. (that kinda falls into detailing). But really, 'finish' the geometry. A trim makes something solid. Makes it look like its build and strong. Its edge will be protected. If you dont use trims it will just look like the geometry is carved out of something solid. (at least thats my experience) Also the trims in d3 with the normal mapping will give nice bevelled edges to your geometry that catch highlights. Very cool!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />  The other half of level building is your idea where you want to go with the level, what should be in there.

Two thoughts spring to mind:
<br /><br />1.  Smoke, flame throwers etc. as i saw recently when i was poking around the page for Quake3 Fortress (a damn dandy mod if ever i have seen one).  Check out this page of their "look what we did":

<br /><br />2.  A recent movie on Everquest 2 was showing off different things that next-gen tech can do.  I am not a EQ fan but i like next gen tech.  I was not terribly impressed overall (D3 looks much better <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />) but in the movie there is a excerpt about about what they have done with the particle engine and there is some really clever stuff.  The movie can be downloaded from fileplanet (if you are a registered user) but i don't know where else to look for it.

<br /><br />Over a year and a half ago I downloaded the alpha. I toyed with it for a few days but while i was impressed with it's capablities, I quickly became bored with the content that was packaged with it. I wanted to make my own.
<br /><br />I found this site and while it had plenty of information it had nothing in the scripting section. I made a post about the sections lack of posts and how someone should write a tutorial. No one responded.
<br /><br />Instead of waiting for someone else to show me, I experimented with scripting commands and figured it out myself. Once I had a good understanding of how it worked, I wrote three tutorials on the subject.
<br /><br />I shared what I learned and I've recieved more positive comments than I ever expected. The funny thing is I am no different than any of you.
<br /><br />So, if you don't know how to do something and you can't find any help here, don't sit on the sidelines and wait for someone to write a tutorial. Toy with the alpha and figure it out, then document what you've learned. You'll gain tons of respect from the community and you can expect the same positive feedback from me.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p18182" date="Posted: Thu Feb 05, 2004 4:31 pm "><author>bullet</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">you do have a point. well, more than one, but that doesn't make up for your first point being a good one  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />so far my process has been: Think up something neat to do in a level. Figure out how it works (if it works somewhere else somehow, even in reality, that helps). Trial &amp; Error all over the place. Eureka! Overuse new 'cool thing' to the point my computer makes odd noises. 
<br />I've been making more and more complex levels as I go. so far I haven't done anything that no one else knows how to do (that I know of), but my ideas are getting to be pretty far out there and I think I'll be doing a few things some time in the next couple of weeks that nobody's done before.

						<div class="postbody">Hm, i like the tutorial idea. I thought about compiling everything i know in one big text file but i kinda shied away from that because its probably illegal and i didnt like putting a lot of effort into something that i cant freely distribute to help others. I would love to write some tutorials exclusively for doom3world but if people cant read it now it probably will be outdated by the time the game ships. Not that it wont be usefull, but it WILL be old and less precise then when it would be for immediate use. Im afraid the gap between now and shipping date is a bit too big. If you say you want to host stuff right now im all for it but i assume thats out of the question  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /><br /><br />GrtZ 3dioot
<br /><br /><br />PS
<br />I looked into some of the camera stuff today but i cant get any of it to work. It looks to me like some external tools were used (outside the editor). I can get a camera to run in my level but it isnt saved with it and im not able to trigger it either.</div>

						<div class="postbody">most tutorials are just about implementing engine features... and that is fine if you just want to learn how to implement more features.
<br /><br />but how bout a tut on how to take what you know how to do... and getting more milage out of it.
<br /><br />It would be cool to make a map with various cool features, and then show what you used for where... and why... that sorta thing. It would be cool to see a tut more on the artistic side of mapping rather than a technical "this is how you do this" tutorial.
<br /><br />Lets face it... alot of mappers (me included) are artistically deprived. The doom mod community would definately appreciate some tuts on adding "style" to a map</div>

						<div class="postbody">Ophd,
<br /><br />You are very right about that. I doubt that im the right person for that though. Ive been doing 3d (offline rendering) for awhile now but im pretty new to mapping. Go here: 
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="viewtopic.php?t=245">http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=245</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />Many experienced mappers replied and it helped me alot. The best thing i can advise you is to look at the existing maps. You are trying to replicate the real world (even if its set in the future its still this real human world we are talking about) so try to abide to its rules. Build everything to scale, place fence's where you could fall and hurt yourself, place lights where you need to see a command panel or instrument, place small lights on the stairsteps or on the ground in a dark hallway so you will see where you have to put your feet and so on and so on. If you make everything serve a purpose you are halfway there. What also really helps is the decal's that you are able to use now. You can dirty stuff up. It can be machinery, the floor that is walked over alot, a wall that is open to air or wind or corrosion of any kind. Also try to work in layers. Layers of depth. Instead of having a clear see through from one end of the room to the other place stuff in your line of sight. I know it sounds kinda weird but this is really quite important. It can be flat planes with a grate texture or cables, a few simple boxes, a big pipe, a column. Try to make it big when you just start on your level. Your room has to look interesting to walk around in even before you start detailing. (i did that wrong in my level and im sorry now) Start with support structures. A ceiling wont stay up by itself. Neither will the walls. And use trims on everything. (that kinda falls into detailing). But really, 'finish' the geometry. A trim makes something solid. Makes it look like its build and strong. Its edge will be protected. If you dont use trims it will just look like the geometry is carved out of something solid. (at least thats my experience) Also the trims in d3 with the normal mapping will give nice bevelled edges to your geometry that catch highlights. Very cool!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />  The other half of level building is your idea where you want to go with the level, what should be in there.

						<div class="postbody">Just a thought, but it would be nice to see not just the basic particles (like those seen in e3_3) but also other dandy things people come up with to do with particles.  Two thoughts spring to mind:
<br /><br />1.  Smoke, flame throwers etc. as i saw recently when i was poking around the page for Quake3 Fortress (a damn dandy mod if ever i have seen one).  Check out this page of their "look what we did":
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.q3f.com/shots_inprogress.html">http://www.q3f.com/shots_inprogress.html</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />2.  A recent movie on Everquest 2 was showing off different things that next-gen tech can do.  I am not a EQ fan but i like next gen tech.  I was not terribly impressed overall (D3 looks much better <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />) but in the movie there is a excerpt about about what they have done with the particle engine and there is some really clever stuff.  The movie can be downloaded from fileplanet (if you are a registered user) but i don't know where else to look for it.
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.fileplanet.com/files/110000/117121.shtml">http://www.fileplanet.com/files/110000/117121.shtml</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />Anyway, it would be nice to see tutorials on how to do some more outlandish stuff with the particles too.</div>

						<div class="postbody">All jokes aside, let me tell you a little story...
<br /><br />Over a year and a half ago I downloaded the alpha. I toyed with it for a few days but while i was impressed with it's capablities, I quickly became bored with the content that was packaged with it. I wanted to make my own.
<br /><br />I found this site and while it had plenty of information it had nothing in the scripting section. I made a post about the sections lack of posts and how someone should write a tutorial. No one responded.
<br /><br />Instead of waiting for someone else to show me, I experimented with scripting commands and figured it out myself. Once I had a good understanding of how it worked, I wrote three tutorials on the subject.
<br /><br />I shared what I learned and I've recieved more positive comments than I ever expected. The funny thing is I am no different than any of you.
<br /><br />So, if you don't know how to do something and you can't find any help here, don't sit on the sidelines and wait for someone to write a tutorial. Toy with the alpha and figure it out, then document what you've learned. You'll gain tons of respect from the community and you can expect the same positive feedback from me.</div>

Figure out how it works (if it works somewhere else somehow, even in reality, that helps). Trial &amp; Error all over the place. Eureka! Overuse new 'cool thing' to the point my computer makes odd noises. 
<br />I've been making more and more complex levels as I go. so far I haven't done anything that no one else knows how to do (that I know of), but my ideas are getting to be pretty far out there and I think I'll be doing a few things some time in the next couple of weeks that nobody's done before. If I actually understand what makes it work (if it works) then I'll start a thread on it!</div>

basicly, the way i think of it is, each (rectangular) brush has six sides to it, but you normally only ever see one of those sides. i.e. one inside wall.&#13;
<br/>
the way i understand caulk to work is, its applied to every face of the brush you cant see, otherwise the engine will be rendering it anyway, and using up processing power.&#13;
<br/>
the way i approach caulking is to highlight All my brushes in a room, batch treat them with the caulk texture. i then go into the room in the cam view, and highlight the brush "faces" (i.e. hold down ctrl + shift while clicking on the inside of a wall) you should see only one face highlighted, i.e. a 2d plane. i highlight all of these( that i can see through the cam view, as i know anything i can see through this view can be seen in the room) and apply new texture to it. &#13;
<br/><br/>
if that isn't clear enough i will write a tutorial up, with pics if i can too!!! &#13;

But, the engine does a great job of removing unseen faces during the compile process. Infact, the compiler does such a great job that there's no need for any kind of hint texture what so ever.&#13;
<br/><br/>
All caulk does is seal leaks, much like it's real world counterpart.&#13;
<br/><br/>
For instance, patches do not seal your level from the void. To counter this you place a brush textured with caulk behind the patch to close the "hole".&#13;
<br/><br/>
Mblackwell, If you can understand the concepts laid out in this post, then congratulations, you've just completed the caulk tutorial.&#13;
<br/><br/>
And if you don't understand what the void or leaks are then a general introduction to mapping with id engine games is in order. You can find that here...&#13;

What I'd usually do is center the pivot to the mesh and move it down so it's at the base of the mesh but centered on X,Y. Then just move the mesh to 0,0,0 in the scene.&#13;
<br/><br/>
If it's something big like a cave or whatever then it's a good idea to use spesific grid placement for the mesh so it can easily be placed inside Radiant based on the same grid setting.</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

so far, what i have been doing is making individual steps out of brushes, then cloning  them, moving the clones to get steps. so far, they look quite bad. i am not sure if i am doing them right. &#13;
<br/>
quiestion. are patches solid? i.e. can i bend them into objects to provide resistance with the player. make steps and railings from patches, instead of brushes? &#13;
<br/><br/>
also, a clearer tutorial on correct lighting placement and implimentation would be good. &#13;
<br/>
i know how to make lights. but there are no light sources. it looks really wierd.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" border="0"/><br/><br/>

<br/>
basicly, the way i think of it is, each (rectangular) brush has six sides to it, but you normally only ever see one of those sides. i.e. one inside wall.&#13;
<br/>
the way i understand caulk to work is, its applied to every face of the brush you cant see, otherwise the engine will be rendering it anyway, and using up processing power.&#13;
<br/>
the way i approach caulking is to highlight All my brushes in a room, batch treat them with the caulk texture. i then go into the room in the cam view, and highlight the brush "faces" (i.e. hold down ctrl + shift while clicking on the inside of a wall) you should see only one face highlighted, i.e. a 2d plane. i highlight all of these( that i can see through the cam view, as i know anything i can see through this view can be seen in the room) and apply new texture to it. &#13;
<br/><br/>
if that isn't clear enough i will write a tutorial up, with pics if i can too!!! &#13;

But, the engine does a great job of removing unseen faces during the compile process. Infact, the compiler does such a great job that there's no need for any kind of hint texture what so ever.&#13;
<br/><br/>
All caulk does is seal leaks, much like it's real world counterpart.&#13;
<br/><br/>
For instance, patches do not seal your level from the void. To counter this you place a brush textured with caulk behind the patch to close the "hole".&#13;
<br/><br/>
Mblackwell, If you can understand the concepts laid out in this post, then congratulations, you've just completed the caulk tutorial.&#13;
<br/><br/>
And if you don't understand what the void or leaks are then a general introduction to mapping with id engine games is in order. You can find that here...&#13;

You basically just weld verts together to make less faces. Like lets say you had a flat square area that is subdevided a certain amount of times. The optimal way of having it would be two triangles right?. So you'd basically take all the extra vertices and weld them into the four main corners of the square leaving two tris as the result.&#13;<br /><br />That's a good way I can think of to describe the low poly optimising. Taking that same approuch to any other model like a character you'll quickly see where you can kill polygons that are not contributing to the overall shape of the model.&#13;<br /><br />You get the auto poly reduction in Max aswell called Multires. This modifier will reduce poly's for you based on your input for percentage or whatever. It's not the best way of doing it though since it can make for a very messy model in the end. In some cases it's useful though.&#13;<br /><br />Building really high poly models and then reducing them in poly count for the game is not a great idea. It's alot of extra work. I usually just make the high poly and then build the low poly around it, it's much faster and leaves a cleaner low poly mesh in the end.&#13;<br /><br />When you do alot of low poly models you get used to how much you can spend in certain areas without really doing too much optimising later.

You basically just weld verts together to make less faces. Like lets say you had a flat square area that is subdevided a certain amount of times. The optimal way of having it would be two triangles right?. So you'd basically take all the extra vertices and weld them into the four main corners of the square leaving two tris as the result.&#13;<br /><br />That's a good way I can think of to describe the low poly optimising. Taking that same approuch to any other model like a character you'll quickly see where you can kill polygons that are not contributing to the overall shape of the model.&#13;<br /><br />You get the auto poly reduction in Max aswell called Multires. This modifier will reduce poly's for you based on your input for percentage or whatever. It's not the best way of doing it though since it can make for a very messy model in the end. In some cases it's useful though.&#13;<br /><br />Building really high poly models and then reducing them in poly count for the game is not a great idea. It's alot of extra work. I usually just make the high poly and then build the low poly around it, it's much faster and leaves a cleaner low poly mesh in the end.&#13;<br /><br />When you do alot of low poly models you get used to how much you can spend in certain areas without really doing too much optimising later. It's like anything else really, the more you do it the better you get.&#13;<br /><br />I think I'm just used to keeping an eye on poly count because I've done so many models for games. It's pretty important to keep to certain poly counts for whatever game you make models.

You basically just weld verts together to make less faces. Like lets say you had a flat square area that is subdevided a certain amount of times. The optimal way of having it would be two triangles right?. So you'd basically take all the extra vertices and weld them into the four main corners of the square leaving two tris as the result.&#13;<br /><br />That's a good way I can think of to describe the low poly optimising. Taking that same approuch to any other model like a character you'll quickly see where you can kill polygons that are not contributing to the overall shape of the model.&#13;<br /><br />You get the auto poly reduction in Max aswell called Multires. This modifier will reduce poly's for you based on your input for percentage or whatever. It's not the best way of doing it though since it can make for a very messy model in the end. In some cases it's useful though.&#13;<br /><br />Building really high poly models and then reducing them in poly count for the game is not a great idea. It's alot of extra work. I usually just make the high poly and then build the low poly around it, it's much faster and leaves a cleaner low poly mesh in the end.&#13;<br /><br />When you do alot of low poly models you get used to how much you can spend in certain areas without really doing too much optimising later. It's like anything else really, the more you do it the better you get.&#13;<br /><br />I think I'm just used to keeping an eye on poly count because I've done so many models for games. It's pretty important to keep to certain poly counts for whatever game you make models. It's basically become a habit for me to model and optimise.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p112017" date="Posted: Thu Sep 08, 2005 9:09 pm "><author>irishlostboy1980</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">yea, i have to try use vertice weld more. gotta try wrap my models properly round the back and weld them together. so much to learn, so little time.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_cry.gif" alt=":cry:" title="Crying or Very sad" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p121989" date="Posted: Fri Nov 18, 2005 7:19 am "><author>Sebazzz</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I'd like to request a tutorial for flikkering texture lights.&#13;<br />I don't really get it so...</div>]]></body></post><post id="p132519" date="Posted: Tue Feb 07, 2006 3:40 pm "><author>irishlostboy1980</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">hey all. has anyone got a good tutorial on placing and using enemies properly? making them do as they are told? all i know about putting enemies into a map is sticking them in. they kinda do there own thing. which is  invariably run at me from all over the map. &#13;<br />any help in this respect would be greatly appreciated.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p132555" date="Posted: Tue Feb 07, 2006 9:32 pm "><author>Skul</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Sebazzz wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I'd like to request a tutorial for flikkering texture lights.<br />I don't really get it so...</div>&#13;<br /><br />I don't think I've ever seen a flickering light texture, only flickering light entities.&#13;<br /><br />Also, I find it impossible to choose a flickering sound to match the light.

I would love to write some tutorials exclusively for doom3world but if people cant read it now it probably will be outdated by the time the game ships. Not that it wont be usefull, but it WILL be old and less precise then when it would be for immediate use. Im afraid the gap between now and shipping date is a bit too big.

<br /><br />but how bout a tut on how to take what you know how to do... and getting more milage out of it.
<br /><br />It would be cool to make a map with various cool features, and then show what you used for where... and why... that sorta thing. It would be cool to see a tut more on the artistic side of mapping rather than a technical "this is how you do this" tutorial.
<br /><br />Lets face it... alot of mappers (me included) are artistically deprived. The doom mod community would definately appreciate some tuts on adding "style" to a map</div>]]></body></post><post id="p2181" date="Posted: Thu Nov 21, 2002 8:33 am "><author>3dioot</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Ophd,
<br /><br />You are very right about that. I doubt that im the right person for that though. Ive been doing 3d (offline rendering) for awhile now but im pretty new to mapping. Go here: 
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="viewtopic.php?t=245">http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=245</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />Many experienced mappers replied and it helped me alot. The best thing i can advise you is to look at the existing maps. You are trying to replicate the real world (even if its set in the future its still this real human world we are talking about) so try to abide to its rules. Build everything to scale, place fence's where you could fall and hurt yourself, place lights where you need to see a command panel or instrument, place small lights on the stairsteps or on the ground in a dark hallway so you will see where you have to put your feet and so on and so on. If you make everything serve a purpose you are halfway there. What also really helps is the decal's that you are able to use now. You can dirty stuff up. It can be machinery, the floor that is walked over alot, a wall that is open to air or wind or corrosion of any kind. Also try to work in layers. Layers of depth. Instead of having a clear see through from one end of the room to the other place stuff in your line of sight. I know it sounds kinda weird but this is really quite important. It can be flat planes with a grate texture or cables, a few simple boxes, a big pipe, a column. Try to make it big when you just start on your level. Your room has to look interesting to walk around in even before you start detailing. (i did that wrong in my level and im sorry now) Start with support structures. A ceiling wont stay up by itself. Neither will the walls. And use trims on everything. (that kinda falls into detailing). But really, 'finish' the geometry. A trim makes something solid. Makes it look like its build and strong. Its edge will be protected. If you dont use trims it will just look like the geometry is carved out of something solid. (at least thats my experience) Also the trims in d3 with the normal mapping will give nice bevelled edges to your geometry that catch highlights. Very cool!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />  The other half of level building is your idea where you want to go with the level, what should be in there.

Two thoughts spring to mind:
<br /><br />1.  Smoke, flame throwers etc. as i saw recently when i was poking around the page for Quake3 Fortress (a damn dandy mod if ever i have seen one).  Check out this page of their "look what we did":

<br /><br />2.  A recent movie on Everquest 2 was showing off different things that next-gen tech can do.  I am not a EQ fan but i like next gen tech.  I was not terribly impressed overall (D3 looks much better <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />) but in the movie there is a excerpt about about what they have done with the particle engine and there is some really clever stuff.  The movie can be downloaded from fileplanet (if you are a registered user) but i don't know where else to look for it.

<br /><br />Over a year and a half ago I downloaded the alpha. I toyed with it for a few days but while i was impressed with it's capablities, I quickly became bored with the content that was packaged with it. I wanted to make my own.
<br /><br />I found this site and while it had plenty of information it had nothing in the scripting section. I made a post about the sections lack of posts and how someone should write a tutorial. No one responded.
<br /><br />Instead of waiting for someone else to show me, I experimented with scripting commands and figured it out myself. Once I had a good understanding of how it worked, I wrote three tutorials on the subject.
<br /><br />I shared what I learned and I've recieved more positive comments than I ever expected. The funny thing is I am no different than any of you.
<br /><br />So, if you don't know how to do something and you can't find any help here, don't sit on the sidelines and wait for someone to write a tutorial. Toy with the alpha and figure it out, then document what you've learned. You'll gain tons of respect from the community and you can expect the same positive feedback from me.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p18182" date="Posted: Thu Feb 05, 2004 4:31 pm "><author>bullet</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">you do have a point. well, more than one, but that doesn't make up for your first point being a good one  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />so far my process has been: Think up something neat to do in a level. Figure out how it works (if it works somewhere else somehow, even in reality, that helps). Trial &amp; Error all over the place. Eureka! Overuse new 'cool thing' to the point my computer makes odd noises. 
<br />I've been making more and more complex levels as I go. so far I haven't done anything that no one else knows how to do (that I know of), but my ideas are getting to be pretty far out there and I think I'll be doing a few things some time in the next couple of weeks that nobody's done before.

						<div class="postbody">Hm, i like the tutorial idea. I thought about compiling everything i know in one big text file but i kinda shied away from that because its probably illegal and i didnt like putting a lot of effort into something that i cant freely distribute to help others. I would love to write some tutorials exclusively for doom3world but if people cant read it now it probably will be outdated by the time the game ships. Not that it wont be usefull, but it WILL be old and less precise then when it would be for immediate use. Im afraid the gap between now and shipping date is a bit too big. If you say you want to host stuff right now im all for it but i assume thats out of the question  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /><br /><br />GrtZ 3dioot
<br /><br /><br />PS
<br />I looked into some of the camera stuff today but i cant get any of it to work. It looks to me like some external tools were used (outside the editor). I can get a camera to run in my level but it isnt saved with it and im not able to trigger it either.</div>

						<div class="postbody">most tutorials are just about implementing engine features... and that is fine if you just want to learn how to implement more features.
<br /><br />but how bout a tut on how to take what you know how to do... and getting more milage out of it.
<br /><br />It would be cool to make a map with various cool features, and then show what you used for where... and why... that sorta thing. It would be cool to see a tut more on the artistic side of mapping rather than a technical "this is how you do this" tutorial.
<br /><br />Lets face it... alot of mappers (me included) are artistically deprived. The doom mod community would definately appreciate some tuts on adding "style" to a map</div>

						<div class="postbody">Ophd,
<br /><br />You are very right about that. I doubt that im the right person for that though. Ive been doing 3d (offline rendering) for awhile now but im pretty new to mapping. Go here: 
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="viewtopic.php?t=245">http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=245</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />Many experienced mappers replied and it helped me alot. The best thing i can advise you is to look at the existing maps. You are trying to replicate the real world (even if its set in the future its still this real human world we are talking about) so try to abide to its rules. Build everything to scale, place fence's where you could fall and hurt yourself, place lights where you need to see a command panel or instrument, place small lights on the stairsteps or on the ground in a dark hallway so you will see where you have to put your feet and so on and so on. If you make everything serve a purpose you are halfway there. What also really helps is the decal's that you are able to use now. You can dirty stuff up. It can be machinery, the floor that is walked over alot, a wall that is open to air or wind or corrosion of any kind. Also try to work in layers. Layers of depth. Instead of having a clear see through from one end of the room to the other place stuff in your line of sight. I know it sounds kinda weird but this is really quite important. It can be flat planes with a grate texture or cables, a few simple boxes, a big pipe, a column. Try to make it big when you just start on your level. Your room has to look interesting to walk around in even before you start detailing. (i did that wrong in my level and im sorry now) Start with support structures. A ceiling wont stay up by itself. Neither will the walls. And use trims on everything. (that kinda falls into detailing). But really, 'finish' the geometry. A trim makes something solid. Makes it look like its build and strong. Its edge will be protected. If you dont use trims it will just look like the geometry is carved out of something solid. (at least thats my experience) Also the trims in d3 with the normal mapping will give nice bevelled edges to your geometry that catch highlights. Very cool!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />  The other half of level building is your idea where you want to go with the level, what should be in there.

						<div class="postbody">Just a thought, but it would be nice to see not just the basic particles (like those seen in e3_3) but also other dandy things people come up with to do with particles.  Two thoughts spring to mind:
<br /><br />1.  Smoke, flame throwers etc. as i saw recently when i was poking around the page for Quake3 Fortress (a damn dandy mod if ever i have seen one).  Check out this page of their "look what we did":
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.q3f.com/shots_inprogress.html">http://www.q3f.com/shots_inprogress.html</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />2.  A recent movie on Everquest 2 was showing off different things that next-gen tech can do.  I am not a EQ fan but i like next gen tech.  I was not terribly impressed overall (D3 looks much better <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />) but in the movie there is a excerpt about about what they have done with the particle engine and there is some really clever stuff.  The movie can be downloaded from fileplanet (if you are a registered user) but i don't know where else to look for it.
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.fileplanet.com/files/110000/117121.shtml">http://www.fileplanet.com/files/110000/117121.shtml</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />Anyway, it would be nice to see tutorials on how to do some more outlandish stuff with the particles too.</div>

						<div class="postbody">All jokes aside, let me tell you a little story...
<br /><br />Over a year and a half ago I downloaded the alpha. I toyed with it for a few days but while i was impressed with it's capablities, I quickly became bored with the content that was packaged with it. I wanted to make my own.
<br /><br />I found this site and while it had plenty of information it had nothing in the scripting section. I made a post about the sections lack of posts and how someone should write a tutorial. No one responded.
<br /><br />Instead of waiting for someone else to show me, I experimented with scripting commands and figured it out myself. Once I had a good understanding of how it worked, I wrote three tutorials on the subject.
<br /><br />I shared what I learned and I've recieved more positive comments than I ever expected. The funny thing is I am no different than any of you.
<br /><br />So, if you don't know how to do something and you can't find any help here, don't sit on the sidelines and wait for someone to write a tutorial. Toy with the alpha and figure it out, then document what you've learned. You'll gain tons of respect from the community and you can expect the same positive feedback from me.</div>

Figure out how it works (if it works somewhere else somehow, even in reality, that helps). Trial &amp; Error all over the place. Eureka! Overuse new 'cool thing' to the point my computer makes odd noises. 
<br />I've been making more and more complex levels as I go. so far I haven't done anything that no one else knows how to do (that I know of), but my ideas are getting to be pretty far out there and I think I'll be doing a few things some time in the next couple of weeks that nobody's done before.

I thought about compiling everything i know in one big text file but i kinda shied away from that because its probably illegal and i didnt like putting a lot of effort into something that i cant freely distribute to help others. I would love to write some tutorials exclusively for doom3world but if people cant read it now it probably will be outdated by the time the game ships. Not that it wont be usefull, but it WILL be old and less precise then when it would be for immediate use. Im afraid the gap between now and shipping date is a bit too big. If you say you want to host stuff right now im all for it but i assume thats out of the question  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /><br /><br />GrtZ 3dioot

<br /><br />It would be cool to make a map with various cool features, and then show what you used for where... and why... that sorta thing. It would be cool to see a tut more on the artistic side of mapping rather than a technical "this is how you do this" tutorial.

<br /><br />Many experienced mappers replied and it helped me alot. The best thing i can advise you is to look at the existing maps. You are trying to replicate the real world (even if its set in the future its still this real human world we are talking about) so try to abide to its rules. Build everything to scale, place fence's where you could fall and hurt yourself, place lights where you need to see a command panel or instrument, place small lights on the stairsteps or on the ground in a dark hallway so you will see where you have to put your feet and so on and so on. If you make everything serve a purpose you are halfway there. What also really helps is the decal's that you are able to use now. You can dirty stuff up. It can be machinery, the floor that is walked over alot, a wall that is open to air or wind or corrosion of any kind. Also try to work in layers. Layers of depth. Instead of having a clear see through from one end of the room to the other place stuff in your line of sight. I know it sounds kinda weird but this is really quite important. It can be flat planes with a grate texture or cables, a few simple boxes, a big pipe, a column. Try to make it big when you just start on your level. Your room has to look interesting to walk around in even before you start detailing. (i did that wrong in my level and im sorry now) Start with support structures. A ceiling wont stay up by itself. Neither will the walls. And use trims on everything. (that kinda falls into detailing). But really, 'finish' the geometry. A trim makes something solid. Makes it look like its build and strong. Its edge will be protected. If you dont use trims it will just look like the geometry is carved out of something solid. (at least thats my experience) Also the trims in d3 with the normal mapping will give nice bevelled edges to your geometry that catch highlights. Very cool!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />  The other half of level building is your idea where you want to go with the level, what should be in there.

Two thoughts spring to mind:
<br /><br />1.  Smoke, flame throwers etc. as i saw recently when i was poking around the page for Quake3 Fortress (a damn dandy mod if ever i have seen one).  Check out this page of their "look what we did":

<br /><br />2.  A recent movie on Everquest 2 was showing off different things that next-gen tech can do.  I am not a EQ fan but i like next gen tech.  I was not terribly impressed overall (D3 looks much better <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />) but in the movie there is a excerpt about about what they have done with the particle engine and there is some really clever stuff.  The movie can be downloaded from fileplanet (if you are a registered user) but i don't know where else to look for it.

<br /><br />Over a year and a half ago I downloaded the alpha. I toyed with it for a few days but while i was impressed with it's capablities, I quickly became bored with the content that was packaged with it. I wanted to make my own.
<br /><br />I found this site and while it had plenty of information it had nothing in the scripting section. I made a post about the sections lack of posts and how someone should write a tutorial. No one responded.
<br /><br />Instead of waiting for someone else to show me, I experimented with scripting commands and figured it out myself. Once I had a good understanding of how it worked, I wrote three tutorials on the subject.
<br /><br />I shared what I learned and I've recieved more positive comments than I ever expected. The funny thing is I am no different than any of you.
<br /><br />So, if you don't know how to do something and you can't find any help here, don't sit on the sidelines and wait for someone to write a tutorial. Toy with the alpha and figure it out, then document what you've learned. You'll gain tons of respect from the community and you can expect the same positive feedback from me.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p18182" date="Posted: Thu Feb 05, 2004 4:31 pm "><author>bullet</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">you do have a point. well, more than one, but that doesn't make up for your first point being a good one  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />so far my process has been: Think up something neat to do in a level. Figure out how it works (if it works somewhere else somehow, even in reality, that helps). Trial &amp; Error all over the place. Eureka! Overuse new 'cool thing' to the point my computer makes odd noises. 
<br />I've been making more and more complex levels as I go. so far I haven't done anything that no one else knows how to do (that I know of), but my ideas are getting to be pretty far out there and I think I'll be doing a few things some time in the next couple of weeks that nobody's done before. If I actually understand what makes it work (if it works) then I'll start a thread on it!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p28360" date=""><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>

						<div class="postbody">Hm, i like the tutorial idea. I thought about compiling everything i know in one big text file but i kinda shied away from that because its probably illegal and i didnt like putting a lot of effort into something that i cant freely distribute to help others. I would love to write some tutorials exclusively for doom3world but if people cant read it now it probably will be outdated by the time the game ships. Not that it wont be usefull, but it WILL be old and less precise then when it would be for immediate use. Im afraid the gap between now and shipping date is a bit too big. If you say you want to host stuff right now im all for it but i assume thats out of the question  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /><br /><br />GrtZ 3dioot
<br /><br /><br />PS
<br />I looked into some of the camera stuff today but i cant get any of it to work. It looks to me like some external tools were used (outside the editor). I can get a camera to run in my level but it isnt saved with it and im not able to trigger it either.</div>

						<div class="postbody">most tutorials are just about implementing engine features... and that is fine if you just want to learn how to implement more features.
<br /><br />but how bout a tut on how to take what you know how to do... and getting more milage out of it.
<br /><br />It would be cool to make a map with various cool features, and then show what you used for where... and why... that sorta thing. It would be cool to see a tut more on the artistic side of mapping rather than a technical "this is how you do this" tutorial.
<br /><br />Lets face it... alot of mappers (me included) are artistically deprived. The doom mod community would definately appreciate some tuts on adding "style" to a map</div>

						<div class="postbody">Ophd,
<br /><br />You are very right about that. I doubt that im the right person for that though. Ive been doing 3d (offline rendering) for awhile now but im pretty new to mapping. Go here: 
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="viewtopic.php?t=245">http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=245</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />Many experienced mappers replied and it helped me alot. The best thing i can advise you is to look at the existing maps. You are trying to replicate the real world (even if its set in the future its still this real human world we are talking about) so try to abide to its rules. Build everything to scale, place fence's where you could fall and hurt yourself, place lights where you need to see a command panel or instrument, place small lights on the stairsteps or on the ground in a dark hallway so you will see where you have to put your feet and so on and so on. If you make everything serve a purpose you are halfway there. What also really helps is the decal's that you are able to use now. You can dirty stuff up. It can be machinery, the floor that is walked over alot, a wall that is open to air or wind or corrosion of any kind. Also try to work in layers. Layers of depth. Instead of having a clear see through from one end of the room to the other place stuff in your line of sight. I know it sounds kinda weird but this is really quite important. It can be flat planes with a grate texture or cables, a few simple boxes, a big pipe, a column. Try to make it big when you just start on your level. Your room has to look interesting to walk around in even before you start detailing. (i did that wrong in my level and im sorry now) Start with support structures. A ceiling wont stay up by itself. Neither will the walls. And use trims on everything. (that kinda falls into detailing). But really, 'finish' the geometry. A trim makes something solid. Makes it look like its build and strong. Its edge will be protected. If you dont use trims it will just look like the geometry is carved out of something solid. (at least thats my experience) Also the trims in d3 with the normal mapping will give nice bevelled edges to your geometry that catch highlights. Very cool!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />  The other half of level building is your idea where you want to go with the level, what should be in there.

						<div class="postbody">Just a thought, but it would be nice to see not just the basic particles (like those seen in e3_3) but also other dandy things people come up with to do with particles.  Two thoughts spring to mind:
<br /><br />1.  Smoke, flame throwers etc. as i saw recently when i was poking around the page for Quake3 Fortress (a damn dandy mod if ever i have seen one).  Check out this page of their "look what we did":
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.q3f.com/shots_inprogress.html">http://www.q3f.com/shots_inprogress.html</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />2.  A recent movie on Everquest 2 was showing off different things that next-gen tech can do.  I am not a EQ fan but i like next gen tech.  I was not terribly impressed overall (D3 looks much better <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />) but in the movie there is a excerpt about about what they have done with the particle engine and there is some really clever stuff.  The movie can be downloaded from fileplanet (if you are a registered user) but i don't know where else to look for it.
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.fileplanet.com/files/110000/117121.shtml">http://www.fileplanet.com/files/110000/117121.shtml</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />Anyway, it would be nice to see tutorials on how to do some more outlandish stuff with the particles too.</div>

						<div class="postbody">All jokes aside, let me tell you a little story...
<br /><br />Over a year and a half ago I downloaded the alpha. I toyed with it for a few days but while i was impressed with it's capablities, I quickly became bored with the content that was packaged with it. I wanted to make my own.
<br /><br />I found this site and while it had plenty of information it had nothing in the scripting section. I made a post about the sections lack of posts and how someone should write a tutorial. No one responded.
<br /><br />Instead of waiting for someone else to show me, I experimented with scripting commands and figured it out myself. Once I had a good understanding of how it worked, I wrote three tutorials on the subject.
<br /><br />I shared what I learned and I've recieved more positive comments than I ever expected. The funny thing is I am no different than any of you.
<br /><br />So, if you don't know how to do something and you can't find any help here, don't sit on the sidelines and wait for someone to write a tutorial. Toy with the alpha and figure it out, then document what you've learned. You'll gain tons of respect from the community and you can expect the same positive feedback from me.</div>

Figure out how it works (if it works somewhere else somehow, even in reality, that helps). Trial &amp; Error all over the place. Eureka! Overuse new 'cool thing' to the point my computer makes odd noises. 
<br />I've been making more and more complex levels as I go. so far I haven't done anything that no one else knows how to do (that I know of), but my ideas are getting to be pretty far out there and I think I'll be doing a few things some time in the next couple of weeks that nobody's done before. If I actually understand what makes it work (if it works) then I'll start a thread on it!</div>

I thought about compiling everything i know in one big text file but i kinda shied away from that because its probably illegal and i didnt like putting a lot of effort into something that i cant freely distribute to help others. I would love to write some tutorials exclusively for doom3world but if people cant read it now it probably will be outdated by the time the game ships. Not that it wont be usefull, but it WILL be old and less precise then when it would be for immediate use. Im afraid the gap between now and shipping date is a bit too big. If you say you want to host stuff right now im all for it but i assume thats out of the question  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /><br /><br />GrtZ 3dioot&#13;<br /><br /><br />PS&#13;<br />I looked into some of the camera stuff today but i cant get any of it to work.

I doubt that im the right person for that though. Ive been doing 3d (offline rendering) for awhile now but im pretty new to mapping. Go here: &#13;<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="viewtopic.php?t=245">http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=245</a><!-- m -->&#13;<br /><br />Many experienced mappers replied and it helped me alot. The best thing i can advise you is to look at the existing maps. You are trying to replicate the real world (even if its set in the future its still this real human world we are talking about) so try to abide to its rules. Build everything to scale, place fence's where you could fall and hurt yourself, place lights where you need to see a command panel or instrument, place small lights on the stairsteps or on the ground in a dark hallway so you will see where you have to put your feet and so on and so on. If you make everything serve a purpose you are halfway there. What also really helps is the decal's that you are able to use now. You can dirty stuff up. It can be machinery, the floor that is walked over alot, a wall that is open to air or wind or corrosion of any kind. Also try to work in layers. Layers of depth. Instead of having a clear see through from one end of the room to the other place stuff in your line of sight. I know it sounds kinda weird but this is really quite important. It can be flat planes with a grate texture or cables, a few simple boxes, a big pipe, a column. Try to make it big when you just start on your level. Your room has to look interesting to walk around in even before you start detailing. (i did that wrong in my level and im sorry now) Start with support structures. A ceiling wont stay up by itself. Neither will the walls. And use trims on everything. (that kinda falls into detailing). But really, 'finish' the geometry. A trim makes something solid. Makes it look like its build and strong. Its edge will be protected. If you dont use trims it will just look like the geometry is carved out of something solid. (at least thats my experience) Also the trims in d3 with the normal mapping will give nice bevelled edges to your geometry that catch highlights. Very cool!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />  The other half of level building is your idea where you want to go with the level, what should be in there. &#13;<br /><br />GrtZ 3dioot</div>]]></body></post><post id="p2193" date="Posted: Thu Nov 21, 2002 10:26 am "><author>Feffer</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">i think a tutorial on the particle system would be a dandy addition, as well as something on the gui interface stuff.

The best thing i can advise you is to look at the existing maps. You are trying to replicate the real world (even if its set in the future its still this real human world we are talking about) so try to abide to its rules. Build everything to scale, place fence's where you could fall and hurt yourself, place lights where you need to see a command panel or instrument, place small lights on the stairsteps or on the ground in a dark hallway so you will see where you have to put your feet and so on and so on. If you make everything serve a purpose you are halfway there. What also really helps is the decal's that you are able to use now. You can dirty stuff up. It can be machinery, the floor that is walked over alot, a wall that is open to air or wind or corrosion of any kind. Also try to work in layers. Layers of depth. Instead of having a clear see through from one end of the room to the other place stuff in your line of sight. I know it sounds kinda weird but this is really quite important. It can be flat planes with a grate texture or cables, a few simple boxes, a big pipe, a column. Try to make it big when you just start on your level. Your room has to look interesting to walk around in even before you start detailing. (i did that wrong in my level and im sorry now) Start with support structures. A ceiling wont stay up by itself. Neither will the walls. And use trims on everything. (that kinda falls into detailing). But really, 'finish' the geometry. A trim makes something solid. Makes it look like its build and strong. Its edge will be protected. If you dont use trims it will just look like the geometry is carved out of something solid. (at least thats my experience) Also the trims in d3 with the normal mapping will give nice bevelled edges to your geometry that catch highlights. Very cool!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />  The other half of level building is your idea where you want to go with the level, what should be in there. &#13;<br /><br />GrtZ 3dioot</div>]]></body></post><post id="p2193" date="Posted: Thu Nov 21, 2002 10:26 am "><author>Feffer</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">i think a tutorial on the particle system would be a dandy addition, as well as something on the gui interface stuff.

<br /><br />2.  A recent movie on Everquest 2 was showing off different things that next-gen tech can do.  I am not a EQ fan but i like next gen tech.  I was not terribly impressed overall (D3 looks much better <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />) but in the movie there is a excerpt about about what they have done with the particle engine and there is some really clever stuff.  The movie can be downloaded from fileplanet (if you are a registered user) but i don't know where else to look for it.

<br /><br />Anyway, it would be nice to see tutorials on how to do some more outlandish stuff with the particles too.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p9987" date="Posted: Sat Jul 19, 2003 12:18 am "><author>bullet</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">elevators!! and how about one on lights, like how to use fog effectively so you don't just have a big cube of fog, which looks horrible if you're outside it. and maybe one on vis portals?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p10015" date="Posted: Sat Jul 19, 2003 1:08 pm "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">bullet wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">elevators!! and how about one on lights, like how to use fog effectively so you don't just have a big cube of fog, which looks horrible if you're outside it. and maybe one on vis portals?</div>

<br /><br />Over a year and a half ago I downloaded the alpha. I toyed with it for a few days but while i was impressed with it's capablities, I quickly became bored with the content that was packaged with it. I wanted to make my own.
<br /><br />I found this site and while it had plenty of information it had nothing in the scripting section. I made a post about the sections lack of posts and how someone should write a tutorial. No one responded.
<br /><br />Instead of waiting for someone else to show me, I experimented with scripting commands and figured it out myself. Once I had a good understanding of how it worked, I wrote three tutorials on the subject.
<br /><br />I shared what I learned and I've recieved more positive comments than I ever expected. The funny thing is I am no different than any of you.
<br /><br />So, if you don't know how to do something and you can't find any help here, don't sit on the sidelines and wait for someone to write a tutorial. Toy with the alpha and figure it out, then document what you've learned. You'll gain tons of respect from the community and you can expect the same positive feedback from me.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p18182" date="Posted: Thu Feb 05, 2004 4:31 pm "><author>bullet</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">you do have a point. well, more than one, but that doesn't make up for your first point being a good one  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />so far my process has been: Think up something neat to do in a level. Figure out how it works (if it works somewhere else somehow, even in reality, that helps). Trial &amp; Error all over the place. Eureka! Overuse new 'cool thing' to the point my computer makes odd noises. 
<br />I've been making more and more complex levels as I go. so far I haven't done anything that no one else knows how to do (that I know of), but my ideas are getting to be pretty far out there and I think I'll be doing a few things some time in the next couple of weeks that nobody's done before. If I actually understand what makes it work (if it works) then I'll start a thread on it!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p28360" date=""><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>

						<div class="postbody">Hm, i like the tutorial idea. I thought about compiling everything i know in one big text file but i kinda shied away from that because its probably illegal and i didnt like putting a lot of effort into something that i cant freely distribute to help others. I would love to write some tutorials exclusively for doom3world but if people cant read it now it probably will be outdated by the time the game ships. Not that it wont be usefull, but it WILL be old and less precise then when it would be for immediate use. Im afraid the gap between now and shipping date is a bit too big. If you say you want to host stuff right now im all for it but i assume thats out of the question  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /><br /><br />GrtZ 3dioot
<br /><br /><br />PS
<br />I looked into some of the camera stuff today but i cant get any of it to work. It looks to me like some external tools were used (outside the editor). I can get a camera to run in my level but it isnt saved with it and im not able to trigger it either.</div>

						<div class="postbody">most tutorials are just about implementing engine features... and that is fine if you just want to learn how to implement more features.
<br /><br />but how bout a tut on how to take what you know how to do... and getting more milage out of it.
<br /><br />It would be cool to make a map with various cool features, and then show what you used for where... and why... that sorta thing. It would be cool to see a tut more on the artistic side of mapping rather than a technical "this is how you do this" tutorial.
<br /><br />Lets face it... alot of mappers (me included) are artistically deprived. The doom mod community would definately appreciate some tuts on adding "style" to a map</div>

						<div class="postbody">Ophd,
<br /><br />You are very right about that. I doubt that im the right person for that though. Ive been doing 3d (offline rendering) for awhile now but im pretty new to mapping. Go here: 
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="viewtopic.php?t=245">http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=245</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />Many experienced mappers replied and it helped me alot. The best thing i can advise you is to look at the existing maps. You are trying to replicate the real world (even if its set in the future its still this real human world we are talking about) so try to abide to its rules. Build everything to scale, place fence's where you could fall and hurt yourself, place lights where you need to see a command panel or instrument, place small lights on the stairsteps or on the ground in a dark hallway so you will see where you have to put your feet and so on and so on. If you make everything serve a purpose you are halfway there. What also really helps is the decal's that you are able to use now. You can dirty stuff up. It can be machinery, the floor that is walked over alot, a wall that is open to air or wind or corrosion of any kind. Also try to work in layers. Layers of depth. Instead of having a clear see through from one end of the room to the other place stuff in your line of sight. I know it sounds kinda weird but this is really quite important. It can be flat planes with a grate texture or cables, a few simple boxes, a big pipe, a column. Try to make it big when you just start on your level. Your room has to look interesting to walk around in even before you start detailing. (i did that wrong in my level and im sorry now) Start with support structures. A ceiling wont stay up by itself. Neither will the walls. And use trims on everything. (that kinda falls into detailing). But really, 'finish' the geometry. A trim makes something solid. Makes it look like its build and strong. Its edge will be protected. If you dont use trims it will just look like the geometry is carved out of something solid. (at least thats my experience) Also the trims in d3 with the normal mapping will give nice bevelled edges to your geometry that catch highlights. Very cool!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />  The other half of level building is your idea where you want to go with the level, what should be in there.

						<div class="postbody">Just a thought, but it would be nice to see not just the basic particles (like those seen in e3_3) but also other dandy things people come up with to do with particles.  Two thoughts spring to mind:
<br /><br />1.  Smoke, flame throwers etc. as i saw recently when i was poking around the page for Quake3 Fortress (a damn dandy mod if ever i have seen one).  Check out this page of their "look what we did":
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.q3f.com/shots_inprogress.html">http://www.q3f.com/shots_inprogress.html</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />2.  A recent movie on Everquest 2 was showing off different things that next-gen tech can do.  I am not a EQ fan but i like next gen tech.  I was not terribly impressed overall (D3 looks much better <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />) but in the movie there is a excerpt about about what they have done with the particle engine and there is some really clever stuff.  The movie can be downloaded from fileplanet (if you are a registered user) but i don't know where else to look for it.
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.fileplanet.com/files/110000/117121.shtml">http://www.fileplanet.com/files/110000/117121.shtml</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />Anyway, it would be nice to see tutorials on how to do some more outlandish stuff with the particles too.</div>

						<div class="postbody">All jokes aside, let me tell you a little story...
<br /><br />Over a year and a half ago I downloaded the alpha. I toyed with it for a few days but while i was impressed with it's capablities, I quickly became bored with the content that was packaged with it. I wanted to make my own.
<br /><br />I found this site and while it had plenty of information it had nothing in the scripting section. I made a post about the sections lack of posts and how someone should write a tutorial. No one responded.
<br /><br />Instead of waiting for someone else to show me, I experimented with scripting commands and figured it out myself. Once I had a good understanding of how it worked, I wrote three tutorials on the subject.
<br /><br />I shared what I learned and I've recieved more positive comments than I ever expected. The funny thing is I am no different than any of you.
<br /><br />So, if you don't know how to do something and you can't find any help here, don't sit on the sidelines and wait for someone to write a tutorial. Toy with the alpha and figure it out, then document what you've learned. You'll gain tons of respect from the community and you can expect the same positive feedback from me.</div>

						<div class="postbody">you do have a point. well, more than one, but that doesn't make up for your first point being a good one  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />so far my process has been: Think up something neat to do in a level. Figure out how it works (if it works somewhere else somehow, even in reality, that helps). Trial &amp; Error all over the place. Eureka! Overuse new 'cool thing' to the point my computer makes odd noises. 
<br />I've been making more and more complex levels as I go. so far I haven't done anything that no one else knows how to do (that I know of), but my ideas are getting to be pretty far out there and I think I'll be doing a few things some time in the next couple of weeks that nobody's done before. If I actually understand what makes it work (if it works) then I'll start a thread on it!</div>

I thought about compiling everything i know in one big text file but i kinda shied away from that because its probably illegal and i didnt like putting a lot of effort into something that i cant freely distribute to help others. I would love to write some tutorials exclusively for doom3world but if people cant read it now it probably will be outdated by the time the game ships. Not that it wont be usefull, but it WILL be old and less precise then when it would be for immediate use. Im afraid the gap between now and shipping date is a bit too big. If you say you want to host stuff right now im all for it but i assume thats out of the question  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /><br /><br />GrtZ 3dioot

<br /><br />but how bout a tut on how to take what you know how to do... and getting more milage out of it.
<br /><br />It would be cool to make a map with various cool features, and then show what you used for where... and why... that sorta thing. It would be cool to see a tut more on the artistic side of mapping rather than a technical "this is how you do this" tutorial.
<br /><br />Lets face it... alot of mappers (me included) are artistically deprived. The doom mod community would definately appreciate some tuts on adding "style" to a map</div>]]></body></post><post id="p2181" date="Posted: Thu Nov 21, 2002 8:33 am "><author>3dioot</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Ophd,
<br /><br />You are very right about that. I doubt that im the right person for that though. Ive been doing 3d (offline rendering) for awhile now but im pretty new to mapping. Go here: 
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="viewtopic.php?t=245">http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=245</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />Many experienced mappers replied and it helped me alot. The best thing i can advise you is to look at the existing maps. You are trying to replicate the real world (even if its set in the future its still this real human world we are talking about) so try to abide to its rules. Build everything to scale, place fence's where you could fall and hurt yourself, place lights where you need to see a command panel or instrument, place small lights on the stairsteps or on the ground in a dark hallway so you will see where you have to put your feet and so on and so on. If you make everything serve a purpose you are halfway there. What also really helps is the decal's that you are able to use now. You can dirty stuff up. It can be machinery, the floor that is walked over alot, a wall that is open to air or wind or corrosion of any kind. Also try to work in layers. Layers of depth. Instead of having a clear see through from one end of the room to the other place stuff in your line of sight. I know it sounds kinda weird but this is really quite important. It can be flat planes with a grate texture or cables, a few simple boxes, a big pipe, a column. Try to make it big when you just start on your level. Your room has to look interesting to walk around in even before you start detailing. (i did that wrong in my level and im sorry now) Start with support structures. A ceiling wont stay up by itself. Neither will the walls. And use trims on everything. (that kinda falls into detailing). But really, 'finish' the geometry. A trim makes something solid. Makes it look like its build and strong. Its edge will be protected. If you dont use trims it will just look like the geometry is carved out of something solid. (at least thats my experience) Also the trims in d3 with the normal mapping will give nice bevelled edges to your geometry that catch highlights. Very cool!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />  The other half of level building is your idea where you want to go with the level, what should be in there.

Two thoughts spring to mind:
<br /><br />1.  Smoke, flame throwers etc. as i saw recently when i was poking around the page for Quake3 Fortress (a damn dandy mod if ever i have seen one).  Check out this page of their "look what we did":

<br /><br />2.  A recent movie on Everquest 2 was showing off different things that next-gen tech can do.  I am not a EQ fan but i like next gen tech.  I was not terribly impressed overall (D3 looks much better <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />) but in the movie there is a excerpt about about what they have done with the particle engine and there is some really clever stuff.  The movie can be downloaded from fileplanet (if you are a registered user) but i don't know where else to look for it.

<br /><br />Over a year and a half ago I downloaded the alpha. I toyed with it for a few days but while i was impressed with it's capablities, I quickly became bored with the content that was packaged with it. I wanted to make my own.
<br /><br />I found this site and while it had plenty of information it had nothing in the scripting section. I made a post about the sections lack of posts and how someone should write a tutorial. No one responded.
<br /><br />Instead of waiting for someone else to show me, I experimented with scripting commands and figured it out myself. Once I had a good understanding of how it worked, I wrote three tutorials on the subject.
<br /><br />I shared what I learned and I've recieved more positive comments than I ever expected. The funny thing is I am no different than any of you.
<br /><br />So, if you don't know how to do something and you can't find any help here, don't sit on the sidelines and wait for someone to write a tutorial. Toy with the alpha and figure it out, then document what you've learned. You'll gain tons of respect from the community and you can expect the same positive feedback from me.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p18182" date="Posted: Thu Feb 05, 2004 4:31 pm "><author>bullet</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">you do have a point. well, more than one, but that doesn't make up for your first point being a good one  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />so far my process has been: Think up something neat to do in a level. Figure out how it works (if it works somewhere else somehow, even in reality, that helps). Trial &amp; Error all over the place. Eureka! Overuse new 'cool thing' to the point my computer makes odd noises. 
<br />I've been making more and more complex levels as I go. so far I haven't done anything that no one else knows how to do (that I know of), but my ideas are getting to be pretty far out there and I think I'll be doing a few things some time in the next couple of weeks that nobody's done before. If I actually understand what makes it work (if it works) then I'll start a thread on it!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p28360" date=""><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>

						<div class="postbody">Hm, i like the tutorial idea. I thought about compiling everything i know in one big text file but i kinda shied away from that because its probably illegal and i didnt like putting a lot of effort into something that i cant freely distribute to help others. I would love to write some tutorials exclusively for doom3world but if people cant read it now it probably will be outdated by the time the game ships. Not that it wont be usefull, but it WILL be old and less precise then when it would be for immediate use. Im afraid the gap between now and shipping date is a bit too big. If you say you want to host stuff right now im all for it but i assume thats out of the question  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /><br /><br />GrtZ 3dioot
<br /><br /><br />PS
<br />I looked into some of the camera stuff today but i cant get any of it to work. It looks to me like some external tools were used (outside the editor). I can get a camera to run in my level but it isnt saved with it and im not able to trigger it either.</div>

						<div class="postbody">most tutorials are just about implementing engine features... and that is fine if you just want to learn how to implement more features.
<br /><br />but how bout a tut on how to take what you know how to do... and getting more milage out of it.
<br /><br />It would be cool to make a map with various cool features, and then show what you used for where... and why... that sorta thing. It would be cool to see a tut more on the artistic side of mapping rather than a technical "this is how you do this" tutorial.
<br /><br />Lets face it... alot of mappers (me included) are artistically deprived. The doom mod community would definately appreciate some tuts on adding "style" to a map</div>

						<div class="postbody">Ophd,
<br /><br />You are very right about that. I doubt that im the right person for that though. Ive been doing 3d (offline rendering) for awhile now but im pretty new to mapping. Go here: 
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="viewtopic.php?t=245">http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=245</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />Many experienced mappers replied and it helped me alot. The best thing i can advise you is to look at the existing maps. You are trying to replicate the real world (even if its set in the future its still this real human world we are talking about) so try to abide to its rules. Build everything to scale, place fence's where you could fall and hurt yourself, place lights where you need to see a command panel or instrument, place small lights on the stairsteps or on the ground in a dark hallway so you will see where you have to put your feet and so on and so on. If you make everything serve a purpose you are halfway there. What also really helps is the decal's that you are able to use now. You can dirty stuff up. It can be machinery, the floor that is walked over alot, a wall that is open to air or wind or corrosion of any kind. Also try to work in layers. Layers of depth. Instead of having a clear see through from one end of the room to the other place stuff in your line of sight. I know it sounds kinda weird but this is really quite important. It can be flat planes with a grate texture or cables, a few simple boxes, a big pipe, a column. Try to make it big when you just start on your level. Your room has to look interesting to walk around in even before you start detailing. (i did that wrong in my level and im sorry now) Start with support structures. A ceiling wont stay up by itself. Neither will the walls. And use trims on everything. (that kinda falls into detailing). But really, 'finish' the geometry. A trim makes something solid. Makes it look like its build and strong. Its edge will be protected. If you dont use trims it will just look like the geometry is carved out of something solid. (at least thats my experience) Also the trims in d3 with the normal mapping will give nice bevelled edges to your geometry that catch highlights. Very cool!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />  The other half of level building is your idea where you want to go with the level, what should be in there.

						<div class="postbody">Just a thought, but it would be nice to see not just the basic particles (like those seen in e3_3) but also other dandy things people come up with to do with particles.  Two thoughts spring to mind:
<br /><br />1.  Smoke, flame throwers etc. as i saw recently when i was poking around the page for Quake3 Fortress (a damn dandy mod if ever i have seen one).  Check out this page of their "look what we did":
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.q3f.com/shots_inprogress.html">http://www.q3f.com/shots_inprogress.html</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />2.  A recent movie on Everquest 2 was showing off different things that next-gen tech can do.  I am not a EQ fan but i like next gen tech.  I was not terribly impressed overall (D3 looks much better <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />) but in the movie there is a excerpt about about what they have done with the particle engine and there is some really clever stuff.  The movie can be downloaded from fileplanet (if you are a registered user) but i don't know where else to look for it.
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.fileplanet.com/files/110000/117121.shtml">http://www.fileplanet.com/files/110000/117121.shtml</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />Anyway, it would be nice to see tutorials on how to do some more outlandish stuff with the particles too.</div>

						<div class="postbody">All jokes aside, let me tell you a little story...
<br /><br />Over a year and a half ago I downloaded the alpha. I toyed with it for a few days but while i was impressed with it's capablities, I quickly became bored with the content that was packaged with it. I wanted to make my own.
<br /><br />I found this site and while it had plenty of information it had nothing in the scripting section. I made a post about the sections lack of posts and how someone should write a tutorial. No one responded.
<br /><br />Instead of waiting for someone else to show me, I experimented with scripting commands and figured it out myself. Once I had a good understanding of how it worked, I wrote three tutorials on the subject.
<br /><br />I shared what I learned and I've recieved more positive comments than I ever expected. The funny thing is I am no different than any of you.
<br /><br />So, if you don't know how to do something and you can't find any help here, don't sit on the sidelines and wait for someone to write a tutorial. Toy with the alpha and figure it out, then document what you've learned. You'll gain tons of respect from the community and you can expect the same positive feedback from me.</div>

Figure out how it works (if it works somewhere else somehow, even in reality, that helps). Trial &amp; Error all over the place. Eureka! Overuse new 'cool thing' to the point my computer makes odd noises. 
<br />I've been making more and more complex levels as I go. so far I haven't done anything that no one else knows how to do (that I know of), but my ideas are getting to be pretty far out there and I think I'll be doing a few things some time in the next couple of weeks that nobody's done before.

I thought about compiling everything i know in one big text file but i kinda shied away from that because its probably illegal and i didnt like putting a lot of effort into something that i cant freely distribute to help others. I would love to write some tutorials exclusively for doom3world but if people cant read it now it probably will be outdated by the time the game ships. Not that it wont be usefull, but it WILL be old and less precise then when it would be for immediate use. Im afraid the gap between now and shipping date is a bit too big. If you say you want to host stuff right now im all for it but i assume thats out of the question  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /><br /><br />GrtZ 3dioot

<br /><br />It would be cool to make a map with various cool features, and then show what you used for where... and why... that sorta thing. It would be cool to see a tut more on the artistic side of mapping rather than a technical "this is how you do this" tutorial.

<br /><br />Many experienced mappers replied and it helped me alot. The best thing i can advise you is to look at the existing maps. You are trying to replicate the real world (even if its set in the future its still this real human world we are talking about) so try to abide to its rules. Build everything to scale, place fence's where you could fall and hurt yourself, place lights where you need to see a command panel or instrument, place small lights on the stairsteps or on the ground in a dark hallway so you will see where you have to put your feet and so on and so on. If you make everything serve a purpose you are halfway there. What also really helps is the decal's that you are able to use now. You can dirty stuff up. It can be machinery, the floor that is walked over alot, a wall that is open to air or wind or corrosion of any kind. Also try to work in layers. Layers of depth. Instead of having a clear see through from one end of the room to the other place stuff in your line of sight. I know it sounds kinda weird but this is really quite important. It can be flat planes with a grate texture or cables, a few simple boxes, a big pipe, a column. Try to make it big when you just start on your level. Your room has to look interesting to walk around in even before you start detailing. (i did that wrong in my level and im sorry now) Start with support structures. A ceiling wont stay up by itself. Neither will the walls. And use trims on everything. (that kinda falls into detailing). But really, 'finish' the geometry. A trim makes something solid. Makes it look like its build and strong. Its edge will be protected. If you dont use trims it will just look like the geometry is carved out of something solid. (at least thats my experience) Also the trims in d3 with the normal mapping will give nice bevelled edges to your geometry that catch highlights. Very cool!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />  The other half of level building is your idea where you want to go with the level, what should be in there.

Two thoughts spring to mind:
<br /><br />1.  Smoke, flame throwers etc. as i saw recently when i was poking around the page for Quake3 Fortress (a damn dandy mod if ever i have seen one).  Check out this page of their "look what we did":

<br /><br />2.  A recent movie on Everquest 2 was showing off different things that next-gen tech can do.  I am not a EQ fan but i like next gen tech.  I was not terribly impressed overall (D3 looks much better <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />) but in the movie there is a excerpt about about what they have done with the particle engine and there is some really clever stuff.  The movie can be downloaded from fileplanet (if you are a registered user) but i don't know where else to look for it.

<br /><br />Anyway, it would be nice to see tutorials on how to do some more outlandish stuff with the particles too.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p9987" date="Posted: Sat Jul 19, 2003 12:18 am "><author>bullet</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">elevators!! and how about one on lights, like how to use fog effectively so you don't just have a big cube of fog, which looks horrible if you're outside it. and maybe one on vis portals?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p10015" date="Posted: Sat Jul 19, 2003 1:08 pm "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">bullet wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">elevators!! and how about one on lights, like how to use fog effectively so you don't just have a big cube of fog, which looks horrible if you're outside it. and maybe one on vis portals?</div>

<br /><br />Over a year and a half ago I downloaded the alpha. I toyed with it for a few days but while i was impressed with it's capablities, I quickly became bored with the content that was packaged with it. I wanted to make my own.
<br /><br />I found this site and while it had plenty of information it had nothing in the scripting section. I made a post about the sections lack of posts and how someone should write a tutorial. No one responded.
<br /><br />Instead of waiting for someone else to show me, I experimented with scripting commands and figured it out myself. Once I had a good understanding of how it worked, I wrote three tutorials on the subject.
<br /><br />I shared what I learned and I've recieved more positive comments than I ever expected. The funny thing is I am no different than any of you.
<br /><br />So, if you don't know how to do something and you can't find any help here, don't sit on the sidelines and wait for someone to write a tutorial. Toy with the alpha and figure it out, then document what you've learned. You'll gain tons of respect from the community and you can expect the same positive feedback from me.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p18182" date="Posted: Thu Feb 05, 2004 4:31 pm "><author>bullet</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">you do have a point. well, more than one, but that doesn't make up for your first point being a good one  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />so far my process has been: Think up something neat to do in a level. Figure out how it works (if it works somewhere else somehow, even in reality, that helps). Trial &amp; Error all over the place. Eureka! Overuse new 'cool thing' to the point my computer makes odd noises. 
<br />I've been making more and more complex levels as I go. so far I haven't done anything that no one else knows how to do (that I know of), but my ideas are getting to be pretty far out there and I think I'll be doing a few things some time in the next couple of weeks that nobody's done before. If I actually understand what makes it work (if it works) then I'll start a thread on it!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p28360" date=""><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>

						<div class="postbody">Hm, i like the tutorial idea. I thought about compiling everything i know in one big text file but i kinda shied away from that because its probably illegal and i didnt like putting a lot of effort into something that i cant freely distribute to help others. I would love to write some tutorials exclusively for doom3world but if people cant read it now it probably will be outdated by the time the game ships. Not that it wont be usefull, but it WILL be old and less precise then when it would be for immediate use. Im afraid the gap between now and shipping date is a bit too big. If you say you want to host stuff right now im all for it but i assume thats out of the question  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /><br /><br />GrtZ 3dioot
<br /><br /><br />PS
<br />I looked into some of the camera stuff today but i cant get any of it to work. It looks to me like some external tools were used (outside the editor). I can get a camera to run in my level but it isnt saved with it and im not able to trigger it either.</div>

						<div class="postbody">most tutorials are just about implementing engine features... and that is fine if you just want to learn how to implement more features.
<br /><br />but how bout a tut on how to take what you know how to do... and getting more milage out of it.
<br /><br />It would be cool to make a map with various cool features, and then show what you used for where... and why... that sorta thing. It would be cool to see a tut more on the artistic side of mapping rather than a technical "this is how you do this" tutorial.
<br /><br />Lets face it... alot of mappers (me included) are artistically deprived. The doom mod community would definately appreciate some tuts on adding "style" to a map</div>

						<div class="postbody">Ophd,
<br /><br />You are very right about that. I doubt that im the right person for that though. Ive been doing 3d (offline rendering) for awhile now but im pretty new to mapping. Go here: 
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="viewtopic.php?t=245">http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=245</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />Many experienced mappers replied and it helped me alot. The best thing i can advise you is to look at the existing maps. You are trying to replicate the real world (even if its set in the future its still this real human world we are talking about) so try to abide to its rules. Build everything to scale, place fence's where you could fall and hurt yourself, place lights where you need to see a command panel or instrument, place small lights on the stairsteps or on the ground in a dark hallway so you will see where you have to put your feet and so on and so on. If you make everything serve a purpose you are halfway there. What also really helps is the decal's that you are able to use now. You can dirty stuff up. It can be machinery, the floor that is walked over alot, a wall that is open to air or wind or corrosion of any kind. Also try to work in layers. Layers of depth. Instead of having a clear see through from one end of the room to the other place stuff in your line of sight. I know it sounds kinda weird but this is really quite important. It can be flat planes with a grate texture or cables, a few simple boxes, a big pipe, a column. Try to make it big when you just start on your level. Your room has to look interesting to walk around in even before you start detailing. (i did that wrong in my level and im sorry now) Start with support structures. A ceiling wont stay up by itself. Neither will the walls. And use trims on everything. (that kinda falls into detailing). But really, 'finish' the geometry. A trim makes something solid. Makes it look like its build and strong. Its edge will be protected. If you dont use trims it will just look like the geometry is carved out of something solid. (at least thats my experience) Also the trims in d3 with the normal mapping will give nice bevelled edges to your geometry that catch highlights. Very cool!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />  The other half of level building is your idea where you want to go with the level, what should be in there.

						<div class="postbody">Just a thought, but it would be nice to see not just the basic particles (like those seen in e3_3) but also other dandy things people come up with to do with particles.  Two thoughts spring to mind:
<br /><br />1.  Smoke, flame throwers etc. as i saw recently when i was poking around the page for Quake3 Fortress (a damn dandy mod if ever i have seen one).  Check out this page of their "look what we did":
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.q3f.com/shots_inprogress.html">http://www.q3f.com/shots_inprogress.html</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />2.  A recent movie on Everquest 2 was showing off different things that next-gen tech can do.  I am not a EQ fan but i like next gen tech.  I was not terribly impressed overall (D3 looks much better <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />) but in the movie there is a excerpt about about what they have done with the particle engine and there is some really clever stuff.  The movie can be downloaded from fileplanet (if you are a registered user) but i don't know where else to look for it.
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.fileplanet.com/files/110000/117121.shtml">http://www.fileplanet.com/files/110000/117121.shtml</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />Anyway, it would be nice to see tutorials on how to do some more outlandish stuff with the particles too.</div>

						<div class="postbody">All jokes aside, let me tell you a little story...
<br /><br />Over a year and a half ago I downloaded the alpha. I toyed with it for a few days but while i was impressed with it's capablities, I quickly became bored with the content that was packaged with it. I wanted to make my own.
<br /><br />I found this site and while it had plenty of information it had nothing in the scripting section. I made a post about the sections lack of posts and how someone should write a tutorial. No one responded.
<br /><br />Instead of waiting for someone else to show me, I experimented with scripting commands and figured it out myself. Once I had a good understanding of how it worked, I wrote three tutorials on the subject.
<br /><br />I shared what I learned and I've recieved more positive comments than I ever expected. The funny thing is I am no different than any of you.
<br /><br />So, if you don't know how to do something and you can't find any help here, don't sit on the sidelines and wait for someone to write a tutorial. Toy with the alpha and figure it out, then document what you've learned. You'll gain tons of respect from the community and you can expect the same positive feedback from me.</div>

Figure out how it works (if it works somewhere else somehow, even in reality, that helps). Trial &amp; Error all over the place. Eureka! Overuse new 'cool thing' to the point my computer makes odd noises. 
<br />I've been making more and more complex levels as I go. so far I haven't done anything that no one else knows how to do (that I know of), but my ideas are getting to be pretty far out there and I think I'll be doing a few things some time in the next couple of weeks that nobody's done before. If I actually understand what makes it work (if it works) then I'll start a thread on it!</div>

I thought about compiling everything i know in one big text file but i kinda shied away from that because its probably illegal and i didnt like putting a lot of effort into something that i cant freely distribute to help others. I would love to write some tutorials exclusively for doom3world but if people cant read it now it probably will be outdated by the time the game ships. Not that it wont be usefull, but it WILL be old and less precise then when it would be for immediate use. Im afraid the gap between now and shipping date is a bit too big. If you say you want to host stuff right now im all for it but i assume thats out of the question  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /><br /><br />GrtZ 3dioot&#13;<br /><br /><br />PS&#13;<br />I looked into some of the camera stuff today but i cant get any of it to work.

I doubt that im the right person for that though. Ive been doing 3d (offline rendering) for awhile now but im pretty new to mapping. Go here: &#13;<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="viewtopic.php?t=245">http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=245</a><!-- m -->&#13;<br /><br />Many experienced mappers replied and it helped me alot. The best thing i can advise you is to look at the existing maps. You are trying to replicate the real world (even if its set in the future its still this real human world we are talking about) so try to abide to its rules. Build everything to scale, place fence's where you could fall and hurt yourself, place lights where you need to see a command panel or instrument, place small lights on the stairsteps or on the ground in a dark hallway so you will see where you have to put your feet and so on and so on. If you make everything serve a purpose you are halfway there. What also really helps is the decal's that you are able to use now. You can dirty stuff up. It can be machinery, the floor that is walked over alot, a wall that is open to air or wind or corrosion of any kind. Also try to work in layers. Layers of depth. Instead of having a clear see through from one end of the room to the other place stuff in your line of sight. I know it sounds kinda weird but this is really quite important. It can be flat planes with a grate texture or cables, a few simple boxes, a big pipe, a column. Try to make it big when you just start on your level. Your room has to look interesting to walk around in even before you start detailing. (i did that wrong in my level and im sorry now) Start with support structures. A ceiling wont stay up by itself. Neither will the walls. And use trims on everything. (that kinda falls into detailing). But really, 'finish' the geometry. A trim makes something solid. Makes it look like its build and strong. Its edge will be protected. If you dont use trims it will just look like the geometry is carved out of something solid. (at least thats my experience) Also the trims in d3 with the normal mapping will give nice bevelled edges to your geometry that catch highlights. Very cool!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />  The other half of level building is your idea where you want to go with the level, what should be in there. &#13;<br /><br />GrtZ 3dioot</div>]]></body></post><post id="p2193" date="Posted: Thu Nov 21, 2002 10:26 am "><author>Feffer</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">i think a tutorial on the particle system would be a dandy addition, as well as something on the gui interface stuff.

I would love to write some tutorials exclusively for doom3world but if people cant read it now it probably will be outdated by the time the game ships. Not that it wont be usefull, but it WILL be old and less precise then when it would be for immediate use. Im afraid the gap between now and shipping date is a bit too big. If you say you want to host stuff right now im all for it but i assume thats out of the question  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /><br /><br />GrtZ 3dioot

<br /><br />but how bout a tut on how to take what you know how to do... and getting more milage out of it.
<br /><br />It would be cool to make a map with various cool features, and then show what you used for where... and why... that sorta thing. It would be cool to see a tut more on the artistic side of mapping rather than a technical "this is how you do this" tutorial.
<br /><br />Lets face it... alot of mappers (me included) are artistically deprived. The doom mod community would definately appreciate some tuts on adding "style" to a map</div>]]></body></post><post id="p2181" date="Posted: Thu Nov 21, 2002 8:33 am "><author>3dioot</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Ophd,
<br /><br />You are very right about that. I doubt that im the right person for that though. Ive been doing 3d (offline rendering) for awhile now but im pretty new to mapping. Go here: 
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="viewtopic.php?t=245">http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=245</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />Many experienced mappers replied and it helped me alot. The best thing i can advise you is to look at the existing maps. You are trying to replicate the real world (even if its set in the future its still this real human world we are talking about) so try to abide to its rules. Build everything to scale, place fence's where you could fall and hurt yourself, place lights where you need to see a command panel or instrument, place small lights on the stairsteps or on the ground in a dark hallway so you will see where you have to put your feet and so on and so on. If you make everything serve a purpose you are halfway there. What also really helps is the decal's that you are able to use now. You can dirty stuff up. It can be machinery, the floor that is walked over alot, a wall that is open to air or wind or corrosion of any kind. Also try to work in layers. Layers of depth. Instead of having a clear see through from one end of the room to the other place stuff in your line of sight. I know it sounds kinda weird but this is really quite important. It can be flat planes with a grate texture or cables, a few simple boxes, a big pipe, a column. Try to make it big when you just start on your level. Your room has to look interesting to walk around in even before you start detailing. (i did that wrong in my level and im sorry now) Start with support structures. A ceiling wont stay up by itself. Neither will the walls. And use trims on everything. (that kinda falls into detailing). But really, 'finish' the geometry. A trim makes something solid. Makes it look like its build and strong. Its edge will be protected. If you dont use trims it will just look like the geometry is carved out of something solid. (at least thats my experience) Also the trims in d3 with the normal mapping will give nice bevelled edges to your geometry that catch highlights. Very cool!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />  The other half of level building is your idea where you want to go with the level, what should be in there.

						<div class="postbody">Hm, i like the tutorial idea. I thought about compiling everything i know in one big text file but i kinda shied away from that because its probably illegal and i didnt like putting a lot of effort into something that i cant freely distribute to help others. I would love to write some tutorials exclusively for doom3world but if people cant read it now it probably will be outdated by the time the game ships. Not that it wont be usefull, but it WILL be old and less precise then when it would be for immediate use. Im afraid the gap between now and shipping date is a bit too big. If you say you want to host stuff right now im all for it but i assume thats out of the question  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /><br /><br />GrtZ 3dioot
<br /><br /><br />PS
<br />I looked into some of the camera stuff today but i cant get any of it to work. It looks to me like some external tools were used (outside the editor). I can get a camera to run in my level but it isnt saved with it and im not able to trigger it either.</div>

						<div class="postbody">most tutorials are just about implementing engine features... and that is fine if you just want to learn how to implement more features.
<br /><br />but how bout a tut on how to take what you know how to do... and getting more milage out of it.
<br /><br />It would be cool to make a map with various cool features, and then show what you used for where... and why... that sorta thing. It would be cool to see a tut more on the artistic side of mapping rather than a technical "this is how you do this" tutorial.
<br /><br />Lets face it... alot of mappers (me included) are artistically deprived. The doom mod community would definately appreciate some tuts on adding "style" to a map</div>

<br /><br />You are very right about that. I doubt that im the right person for that though. Ive been doing 3d (offline rendering) for awhile now but im pretty new to mapping. Go here:

<br /><br />Many experienced mappers replied and it helped me alot. The best thing i can advise you is to look at the existing maps. You are trying to replicate the real world (even if its set in the future its still this real human world we are talking about) so try to abide to its rules. Build everything to scale, place fence's where you could fall and hurt yourself, place lights where you need to see a command panel or instrument, place small lights on the stairsteps or on the ground in a dark hallway so you will see where you have to put your feet and so on and so on. If you make everything serve a purpose you are halfway there. What also really helps is the decal's that you are able to use now. You can dirty stuff up. It can be machinery, the floor that is walked over alot, a wall that is open to air or wind or corrosion of any kind. Also try to work in layers. Layers of depth. Instead of having a clear see through from one end of the room to the other place stuff in your line of sight. I know it sounds kinda weird but this is really quite important. It can be flat planes with a grate texture or cables, a few simple boxes, a big pipe, a column. Try to make it big when you just start on your level. Your room has to look interesting to walk around in even before you start detailing. (i did that wrong in my level and im sorry now) Start with support structures. A ceiling wont stay up by itself. Neither will the walls. And use trims on everything. (that kinda falls into detailing). But really, 'finish' the geometry. A trim makes something solid. Makes it look like its build and strong. Its edge will be protected. If you dont use trims it will just look like the geometry is carved out of something solid. (at least thats my experience) Also the trims in d3 with the normal mapping will give nice bevelled edges to your geometry that catch highlights. Very cool!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />  The other half of level building is your idea where you want to go with the level, what should be in there.

						<div class="postbody">Just a thought, but it would be nice to see not just the basic particles (like those seen in e3_3) but also other dandy things people come up with to do with particles.  Two thoughts spring to mind:
<br /><br />1.  Smoke, flame throwers etc. as i saw recently when i was poking around the page for Quake3 Fortress (a damn dandy mod if ever i have seen one).  Check out this page of their "look what we did":
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.q3f.com/shots_inprogress.html">http://www.q3f.com/shots_inprogress.html</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />2.  A recent movie on Everquest 2 was showing off different things that next-gen tech can do.  I am not a EQ fan but i like next gen tech.  I was not terribly impressed overall (D3 looks much better <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />) but in the movie there is a excerpt about about what they have done with the particle engine and there is some really clever stuff.  The movie can be downloaded from fileplanet (if you are a registered user) but i don't know where else to look for it.
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.fileplanet.com/files/110000/117121.shtml">http://www.fileplanet.com/files/110000/117121.shtml</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />Anyway, it would be nice to see tutorials on how to do some more outlandish stuff with the particles too.</div>

						<div class="postbody">All jokes aside, let me tell you a little story...
<br /><br />Over a year and a half ago I downloaded the alpha. I toyed with it for a few days but while i was impressed with it's capablities, I quickly became bored with the content that was packaged with it. I wanted to make my own.
<br /><br />I found this site and while it had plenty of information it had nothing in the scripting section. I made a post about the sections lack of posts and how someone should write a tutorial. No one responded.
<br /><br />Instead of waiting for someone else to show me, I experimented with scripting commands and figured it out myself. Once I had a good understanding of how it worked, I wrote three tutorials on the subject.
<br /><br />I shared what I learned and I've recieved more positive comments than I ever expected. The funny thing is I am no different than any of you.
<br /><br />So, if you don't know how to do something and you can't find any help here, don't sit on the sidelines and wait for someone to write a tutorial. Toy with the alpha and figure it out, then document what you've learned. You'll gain tons of respect from the community and you can expect the same positive feedback from me.</div>

Figure out how it works (if it works somewhere else somehow, even in reality, that helps). Trial &amp; Error all over the place. Eureka! Overuse new 'cool thing' to the point my computer makes odd noises. 
<br />I've been making more and more complex levels as I go. so far I haven't done anything that no one else knows how to do (that I know of), but my ideas are getting to be pretty far out there and I think I'll be doing a few things some time in the next couple of weeks that nobody's done before. If I actually understand what makes it work (if it works) then I'll start a thread on it!</div>

I thought about compiling everything i know in one big text file but i kinda shied away from that because its probably illegal and i didnt like putting a lot of effort into something that i cant freely distribute to help others. I would love to write some tutorials exclusively for doom3world but if people cant read it now it probably will be outdated by the time the game ships. Not that it wont be usefull, but it WILL be old and less precise then when it would be for immediate use. Im afraid the gap between now and shipping date is a bit too big. If you say you want to host stuff right now im all for it but i assume thats out of the question  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /><br /><br />GrtZ 3dioot
<br /><br /><br />PS
<br />I looked into some of the camera stuff today but i cant get any of it to work. It looks to me like some external tools were used (outside the editor). I can get a camera to run in my level but it isnt saved with it and im not able to trigger it either.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p2153" date="Posted: Wed Nov 20, 2002 9:05 pm "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks for your offer 3dioot - any help will be greatly appreciated.

<br /><br />but how bout a tut on how to take what you know how to do... and getting more milage out of it.
<br /><br />It would be cool to make a map with various cool features, and then show what you used for where... and why... that sorta thing. It would be cool to see a tut more on the artistic side of mapping rather than a technical "this is how you do this" tutorial.
<br /><br />Lets face it... alot of mappers (me included) are artistically deprived. The doom mod community would definately appreciate some tuts on adding "style" to a map</div>]]></body></post><post id="p2181" date="Posted: Thu Nov 21, 2002 8:33 am "><author>3dioot</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Ophd,
<br /><br />You are very right about that. I doubt that im the right person for that though. Ive been doing 3d (offline rendering) for awhile now but im pretty new to mapping. Go here: 
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="viewtopic.php?t=245">http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=245</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />Many experienced mappers replied and it helped me alot. The best thing i can advise you is to look at the existing maps. You are trying to replicate the real world (even if its set in the future its still this real human world we are talking about) so try to abide to its rules. Build everything to scale, place fence's where you could fall and hurt yourself, place lights where you need to see a command panel or instrument, place small lights on the stairsteps or on the ground in a dark hallway so you will see where you have to put your feet and so on and so on. If you make everything serve a purpose you are halfway there. What also really helps is the decal's that you are able to use now. You can dirty stuff up. It can be machinery, the floor that is walked over alot, a wall that is open to air or wind or corrosion of any kind. Also try to work in layers. Layers of depth. Instead of having a clear see through from one end of the room to the other place stuff in your line of sight. I know it sounds kinda weird but this is really quite important. It can be flat planes with a grate texture or cables, a few simple boxes, a big pipe, a column. Try to make it big when you just start on your level. Your room has to look interesting to walk around in even before you start detailing. (i did that wrong in my level and im sorry now) Start with support structures. A ceiling wont stay up by itself. Neither will the walls. And use trims on everything. (that kinda falls into detailing). But really, 'finish' the geometry. A trim makes something solid. Makes it look like its build and strong. Its edge will be protected. If you dont use trims it will just look like the geometry is carved out of something solid. (at least thats my experience) Also the trims in d3 with the normal mapping will give nice bevelled edges to your geometry that catch highlights. Very cool!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />  The other half of level building is your idea where you want to go with the level, what should be in there.

Two thoughts spring to mind:
<br /><br />1.  Smoke, flame throwers etc. as i saw recently when i was poking around the page for Quake3 Fortress (a damn dandy mod if ever i have seen one).  Check out this page of their "look what we did":
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.q3f.com/shots_inprogress.html">http://www.q3f.com/shots_inprogress.html</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />2.  A recent movie on Everquest 2 was showing off different things that next-gen tech can do.  I am not a EQ fan but i like next gen tech.  I was not terribly impressed overall (D3 looks much better <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />) but in the movie there is a excerpt about about what they have done with the particle engine and there is some really clever stuff.  The movie can be downloaded from fileplanet (if you are a registered user) but i don't know where else to look for it.

<br /><br />Anyway, it would be nice to see tutorials on how to do some more outlandish stuff with the particles too.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p9987" date="Posted: Sat Jul 19, 2003 12:18 am "><author>bullet</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">elevators!! and how about one on lights, like how to use fog effectively so you don't just have a big cube of fog, which looks horrible if you're outside it. and maybe one on vis portals?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p10015" date="Posted: Sat Jul 19, 2003 1:08 pm "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">bullet wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">elevators!! and how about one on lights, like how to use fog effectively so you don't just have a big cube of fog, which looks horrible if you're outside it. and maybe one on vis portals?</div>

<br /><br />Over a year and a half ago I downloaded the alpha. I toyed with it for a few days but while i was impressed with it's capablities, I quickly became bored with the content that was packaged with it. I wanted to make my own.
<br /><br />I found this site and while it had plenty of information it had nothing in the scripting section. I made a post about the sections lack of posts and how someone should write a tutorial. No one responded.
<br /><br />Instead of waiting for someone else to show me, I experimented with scripting commands and figured it out myself. Once I had a good understanding of how it worked, I wrote three tutorials on the subject.
<br /><br />I shared what I learned and I've recieved more positive comments than I ever expected. The funny thing is I am no different than any of you.
<br /><br />So, if you don't know how to do something and you can't find any help here, don't sit on the sidelines and wait for someone to write a tutorial. Toy with the alpha and figure it out, then document what you've learned. You'll gain tons of respect from the community and you can expect the same positive feedback from me.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p18182" date="Posted: Thu Feb 05, 2004 4:31 pm "><author>bullet</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">you do have a point. well, more than one, but that doesn't make up for your first point being a good one  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />so far my process has been: Think up something neat to do in a level. Figure out how it works (if it works somewhere else somehow, even in reality, that helps). Trial &amp; Error all over the place. Eureka! Overuse new 'cool thing' to the point my computer makes odd noises. 
<br />I've been making more and more complex levels as I go. so far I haven't done anything that no one else knows how to do (that I know of), but my ideas are getting to be pretty far out there and I think I'll be doing a few things some time in the next couple of weeks that nobody's done before. If I actually understand what makes it work (if it works) then I'll start a thread on it!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p28360" date=""><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>

						<div class="postbody">Hm, i like the tutorial idea. I thought about compiling everything i know in one big text file but i kinda shied away from that because its probably illegal and i didnt like putting a lot of effort into something that i cant freely distribute to help others. I would love to write some tutorials exclusively for doom3world but if people cant read it now it probably will be outdated by the time the game ships. Not that it wont be usefull, but it WILL be old and less precise then when it would be for immediate use. Im afraid the gap between now and shipping date is a bit too big. If you say you want to host stuff right now im all for it but i assume thats out of the question  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /><br /><br />GrtZ 3dioot
<br /><br /><br />PS
<br />I looked into some of the camera stuff today but i cant get any of it to work. It looks to me like some external tools were used (outside the editor). I can get a camera to run in my level but it isnt saved with it and im not able to trigger it either.</div>

						<div class="postbody">most tutorials are just about implementing engine features... and that is fine if you just want to learn how to implement more features.
<br /><br />but how bout a tut on how to take what you know how to do... and getting more milage out of it.
<br /><br />It would be cool to make a map with various cool features, and then show what you used for where... and why... that sorta thing. It would be cool to see a tut more on the artistic side of mapping rather than a technical "this is how you do this" tutorial.
<br /><br />Lets face it... alot of mappers (me included) are artistically deprived. The doom mod community would definately appreciate some tuts on adding "style" to a map</div>

						<div class="postbody">Ophd,
<br /><br />You are very right about that. I doubt that im the right person for that though. Ive been doing 3d (offline rendering) for awhile now but im pretty new to mapping. Go here: 
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="viewtopic.php?t=245">http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=245</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />Many experienced mappers replied and it helped me alot. The best thing i can advise you is to look at the existing maps. You are trying to replicate the real world (even if its set in the future its still this real human world we are talking about) so try to abide to its rules. Build everything to scale, place fence's where you could fall and hurt yourself, place lights where you need to see a command panel or instrument, place small lights on the stairsteps or on the ground in a dark hallway so you will see where you have to put your feet and so on and so on. If you make everything serve a purpose you are halfway there. What also really helps is the decal's that you are able to use now. You can dirty stuff up. It can be machinery, the floor that is walked over alot, a wall that is open to air or wind or corrosion of any kind. Also try to work in layers. Layers of depth. Instead of having a clear see through from one end of the room to the other place stuff in your line of sight. I know it sounds kinda weird but this is really quite important. It can be flat planes with a grate texture or cables, a few simple boxes, a big pipe, a column. Try to make it big when you just start on your level. Your room has to look interesting to walk around in even before you start detailing. (i did that wrong in my level and im sorry now) Start with support structures. A ceiling wont stay up by itself. Neither will the walls. And use trims on everything. (that kinda falls into detailing). But really, 'finish' the geometry. A trim makes something solid. Makes it look like its build and strong. Its edge will be protected. If you dont use trims it will just look like the geometry is carved out of something solid. (at least thats my experience) Also the trims in d3 with the normal mapping will give nice bevelled edges to your geometry that catch highlights. Very cool!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />  The other half of level building is your idea where you want to go with the level, what should be in there.

						<div class="postbody">Just a thought, but it would be nice to see not just the basic particles (like those seen in e3_3) but also other dandy things people come up with to do with particles.  Two thoughts spring to mind:
<br /><br />1.  Smoke, flame throwers etc. as i saw recently when i was poking around the page for Quake3 Fortress (a damn dandy mod if ever i have seen one).  Check out this page of their "look what we did":
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.q3f.com/shots_inprogress.html">http://www.q3f.com/shots_inprogress.html</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />2.  A recent movie on Everquest 2 was showing off different things that next-gen tech can do.  I am not a EQ fan but i like next gen tech.  I was not terribly impressed overall (D3 looks much better <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />) but in the movie there is a excerpt about about what they have done with the particle engine and there is some really clever stuff.  The movie can be downloaded from fileplanet (if you are a registered user) but i don't know where else to look for it.
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.fileplanet.com/files/110000/117121.shtml">http://www.fileplanet.com/files/110000/117121.shtml</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />Anyway, it would be nice to see tutorials on how to do some more outlandish stuff with the particles too.</div>

						<div class="postbody">All jokes aside, let me tell you a little story...
<br /><br />Over a year and a half ago I downloaded the alpha. I toyed with it for a few days but while i was impressed with it's capablities, I quickly became bored with the content that was packaged with it. I wanted to make my own.
<br /><br />I found this site and while it had plenty of information it had nothing in the scripting section. I made a post about the sections lack of posts and how someone should write a tutorial. No one responded.
<br /><br />Instead of waiting for someone else to show me, I experimented with scripting commands and figured it out myself. Once I had a good understanding of how it worked, I wrote three tutorials on the subject.
<br /><br />I shared what I learned and I've recieved more positive comments than I ever expected. The funny thing is I am no different than any of you.
<br /><br />So, if you don't know how to do something and you can't find any help here, don't sit on the sidelines and wait for someone to write a tutorial. Toy with the alpha and figure it out, then document what you've learned. You'll gain tons of respect from the community and you can expect the same positive feedback from me.</div>

Figure out how it works (if it works somewhere else somehow, even in reality, that helps). Trial &amp; Error all over the place. Eureka! Overuse new 'cool thing' to the point my computer makes odd noises. 
<br />I've been making more and more complex levels as I go. so far I haven't done anything that no one else knows how to do (that I know of), but my ideas are getting to be pretty far out there and I think I'll be doing a few things some time in the next couple of weeks that nobody's done before.

I would love to write some tutorials exclusively for doom3world but if people cant read it now it probably will be outdated by the time the game ships. Not that it wont be usefull, but it WILL be old and less precise then when it would be for immediate use. Im afraid the gap between now and shipping date is a bit too big.

<br /><br />It would be cool to make a map with various cool features, and then show what you used for where... and why... that sorta thing. It would be cool to see a tut more on the artistic side of mapping rather than a technical "this is how you do this" tutorial.

<br /><br />You are very right about that. I doubt that im the right person for that though. Ive been doing 3d (offline rendering) for awhile now but im pretty new to mapping. Go here: 
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="viewtopic.php?t=245">http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=245</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />Many experienced mappers replied and it helped me alot. The best thing i can advise you is to look at the existing maps. You are trying to replicate the real world (even if its set in the future its still this real human world we are talking about) so try to abide to its rules. Build everything to scale, place fence's where you could fall and hurt yourself, place lights where you need to see a command panel or instrument, place small lights on the stairsteps or on the ground in a dark hallway so you will see where you have to put your feet and so on and so on. If you make everything serve a purpose you are halfway there. What also really helps is the decal's that you are able to use now. You can dirty stuff up. It can be machinery, the floor that is walked over alot, a wall that is open to air or wind or corrosion of any kind. Also try to work in layers. Layers of depth. Instead of having a clear see through from one end of the room to the other place stuff in your line of sight. I know it sounds kinda weird but this is really quite important. It can be flat planes with a grate texture or cables, a few simple boxes, a big pipe, a column. Try to make it big when you just start on your level. Your room has to look interesting to walk around in even before you start detailing. (i did that wrong in my level and im sorry now) Start with support structures. A ceiling wont stay up by itself. Neither will the walls. And use trims on everything. (that kinda falls into detailing). But really, 'finish' the geometry. A trim makes something solid. Makes it look like its build and strong. Its edge will be protected. If you dont use trims it will just look like the geometry is carved out of something solid. (at least thats my experience) Also the trims in d3 with the normal mapping will give nice bevelled edges to your geometry that catch highlights. Very cool!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />  The other half of level building is your idea where you want to go with the level, what should be in there.

<br /><br />2.  A recent movie on Everquest 2 was showing off different things that next-gen tech can do.  I am not a EQ fan but i like next gen tech.  I was not terribly impressed overall (D3 looks much better <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />) but in the movie there is a excerpt about about what they have done with the particle engine and there is some really clever stuff.  The movie can be downloaded from fileplanet (if you are a registered user) but i don't know where else to look for it.

<br /><br />Anyway, it would be nice to see tutorials on how to do some more outlandish stuff with the particles too.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p9987" date="Posted: Sat Jul 19, 2003 12:18 am "><author>bullet</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">elevators!! and how about one on lights, like how to use fog effectively so you don't just have a big cube of fog, which looks horrible if you're outside it. and maybe one on vis portals?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p10015" date="Posted: Sat Jul 19, 2003 1:08 pm "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">bullet wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">elevators!! and how about one on lights, like how to use fog effectively so you don't just have a big cube of fog, which looks horrible if you're outside it. and maybe one on vis portals?</div>

<br /><br />Over a year and a half ago I downloaded the alpha. I toyed with it for a few days but while i was impressed with it's capablities, I quickly became bored with the content that was packaged with it. I wanted to make my own.
<br /><br />I found this site and while it had plenty of information it had nothing in the scripting section. I made a post about the sections lack of posts and how someone should write a tutorial. No one responded.
<br /><br />Instead of waiting for someone else to show me, I experimented with scripting commands and figured it out myself. Once I had a good understanding of how it worked, I wrote three tutorials on the subject.
<br /><br />I shared what I learned and I've recieved more positive comments than I ever expected. The funny thing is I am no different than any of you.
<br /><br />So, if you don't know how to do something and you can't find any help here, don't sit on the sidelines and wait for someone to write a tutorial. Toy with the alpha and figure it out, then document what you've learned. You'll gain tons of respect from the community and you can expect the same positive feedback from me.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p18182" date="Posted: Thu Feb 05, 2004 4:31 pm "><author>bullet</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">you do have a point. well, more than one, but that doesn't make up for your first point being a good one  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />so far my process has been: Think up something neat to do in a level. Figure out how it works (if it works somewhere else somehow, even in reality, that helps). Trial &amp; Error all over the place. Eureka! Overuse new 'cool thing' to the point my computer makes odd noises. 
<br />I've been making more and more complex levels as I go. so far I haven't done anything that no one else knows how to do (that I know of), but my ideas are getting to be pretty far out there and I think I'll be doing a few things some time in the next couple of weeks that nobody's done before. If I actually understand what makes it work (if it works) then I'll start a thread on it!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p28360" date=""><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>

						<div class="postbody">Hm, i like the tutorial idea. I thought about compiling everything i know in one big text file but i kinda shied away from that because its probably illegal and i didnt like putting a lot of effort into something that i cant freely distribute to help others. I would love to write some tutorials exclusively for doom3world but if people cant read it now it probably will be outdated by the time the game ships. Not that it wont be usefull, but it WILL be old and less precise then when it would be for immediate use. Im afraid the gap between now and shipping date is a bit too big. If you say you want to host stuff right now im all for it but i assume thats out of the question  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /><br /><br />GrtZ 3dioot
<br /><br /><br />PS
<br />I looked into some of the camera stuff today but i cant get any of it to work. It looks to me like some external tools were used (outside the editor). I can get a camera to run in my level but it isnt saved with it and im not able to trigger it either.</div>

						<div class="postbody">most tutorials are just about implementing engine features... and that is fine if you just want to learn how to implement more features.
<br /><br />but how bout a tut on how to take what you know how to do... and getting more milage out of it.
<br /><br />It would be cool to make a map with various cool features, and then show what you used for where... and why... that sorta thing. It would be cool to see a tut more on the artistic side of mapping rather than a technical "this is how you do this" tutorial.
<br /><br />Lets face it... alot of mappers (me included) are artistically deprived. The doom mod community would definately appreciate some tuts on adding "style" to a map</div>

						<div class="postbody">Ophd,
<br /><br />You are very right about that. I doubt that im the right person for that though. Ive been doing 3d (offline rendering) for awhile now but im pretty new to mapping. Go here: 
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="viewtopic.php?t=245">http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=245</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />Many experienced mappers replied and it helped me alot. The best thing i can advise you is to look at the existing maps. You are trying to replicate the real world (even if its set in the future its still this real human world we are talking about) so try to abide to its rules. Build everything to scale, place fence's where you could fall and hurt yourself, place lights where you need to see a command panel or instrument, place small lights on the stairsteps or on the ground in a dark hallway so you will see where you have to put your feet and so on and so on. If you make everything serve a purpose you are halfway there. What also really helps is the decal's that you are able to use now. You can dirty stuff up. It can be machinery, the floor that is walked over alot, a wall that is open to air or wind or corrosion of any kind. Also try to work in layers. Layers of depth. Instead of having a clear see through from one end of the room to the other place stuff in your line of sight. I know it sounds kinda weird but this is really quite important. It can be flat planes with a grate texture or cables, a few simple boxes, a big pipe, a column. Try to make it big when you just start on your level. Your room has to look interesting to walk around in even before you start detailing. (i did that wrong in my level and im sorry now) Start with support structures. A ceiling wont stay up by itself. Neither will the walls. And use trims on everything. (that kinda falls into detailing). But really, 'finish' the geometry. A trim makes something solid. Makes it look like its build and strong. Its edge will be protected. If you dont use trims it will just look like the geometry is carved out of something solid. (at least thats my experience) Also the trims in d3 with the normal mapping will give nice bevelled edges to your geometry that catch highlights. Very cool!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />  The other half of level building is your idea where you want to go with the level, what should be in there.

						<div class="postbody">Just a thought, but it would be nice to see not just the basic particles (like those seen in e3_3) but also other dandy things people come up with to do with particles.  Two thoughts spring to mind:
<br /><br />1.  Smoke, flame throwers etc. as i saw recently when i was poking around the page for Quake3 Fortress (a damn dandy mod if ever i have seen one).  Check out this page of their "look what we did":
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.q3f.com/shots_inprogress.html">http://www.q3f.com/shots_inprogress.html</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />2.  A recent movie on Everquest 2 was showing off different things that next-gen tech can do.  I am not a EQ fan but i like next gen tech.  I was not terribly impressed overall (D3 looks much better <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />) but in the movie there is a excerpt about about what they have done with the particle engine and there is some really clever stuff.  The movie can be downloaded from fileplanet (if you are a registered user) but i don't know where else to look for it.
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.fileplanet.com/files/110000/117121.shtml">http://www.fileplanet.com/files/110000/117121.shtml</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />Anyway, it would be nice to see tutorials on how to do some more outlandish stuff with the particles too.</div>

						<div class="postbody">All jokes aside, let me tell you a little story...
<br /><br />Over a year and a half ago I downloaded the alpha. I toyed with it for a few days but while i was impressed with it's capablities, I quickly became bored with the content that was packaged with it. I wanted to make my own.
<br /><br />I found this site and while it had plenty of information it had nothing in the scripting section. I made a post about the sections lack of posts and how someone should write a tutorial. No one responded.
<br /><br />Instead of waiting for someone else to show me, I experimented with scripting commands and figured it out myself. Once I had a good understanding of how it worked, I wrote three tutorials on the subject.
<br /><br />I shared what I learned and I've recieved more positive comments than I ever expected. The funny thing is I am no different than any of you.
<br /><br />So, if you don't know how to do something and you can't find any help here, don't sit on the sidelines and wait for someone to write a tutorial. Toy with the alpha and figure it out, then document what you've learned. You'll gain tons of respect from the community and you can expect the same positive feedback from me.</div>

I thought about compiling everything i know in one big text file but i kinda shied away from that because its probably illegal and i didnt like putting a lot of effort into something that i cant freely distribute to help others. I would love to write some tutorials exclusively for doom3world but if people cant read it now it probably will be outdated by the time the game ships. Not that it wont be usefull, but it WILL be old and less precise then when it would be for immediate use. Im afraid the gap between now and shipping date is a bit too big. If you say you want to host stuff right now im all for it but i assume thats out of the question  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /><br /><br />GrtZ 3dioot&#13;<br /><br /><br />PS&#13;<br />I looked into some of the camera stuff today but i cant get any of it to work.

I doubt that im the right person for that though. Ive been doing 3d (offline rendering) for awhile now but im pretty new to mapping. Go here: &#13;<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="viewtopic.php?t=245">http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=245</a><!-- m -->&#13;<br /><br />Many experienced mappers replied and it helped me alot. The best thing i can advise you is to look at the existing maps. You are trying to replicate the real world (even if its set in the future its still this real human world we are talking about) so try to abide to its rules. Build everything to scale, place fence's where you could fall and hurt yourself, place lights where you need to see a command panel or instrument, place small lights on the stairsteps or on the ground in a dark hallway so you will see where you have to put your feet and so on and so on. If you make everything serve a purpose you are halfway there. What also really helps is the decal's that you are able to use now. You can dirty stuff up. It can be machinery, the floor that is walked over alot, a wall that is open to air or wind or corrosion of any kind. Also try to work in layers. Layers of depth. Instead of having a clear see through from one end of the room to the other place stuff in your line of sight. I know it sounds kinda weird but this is really quite important. It can be flat planes with a grate texture or cables, a few simple boxes, a big pipe, a column. Try to make it big when you just start on your level. Your room has to look interesting to walk around in even before you start detailing. (i did that wrong in my level and im sorry now) Start with support structures. A ceiling wont stay up by itself. Neither will the walls. And use trims on everything. (that kinda falls into detailing). But really, 'finish' the geometry. A trim makes something solid. Makes it look like its build and strong. Its edge will be protected. If you dont use trims it will just look like the geometry is carved out of something solid. (at least thats my experience) Also the trims in d3 with the normal mapping will give nice bevelled edges to your geometry that catch highlights. Very cool!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />  The other half of level building is your idea where you want to go with the level, what should be in there. &#13;<br /><br />GrtZ 3dioot</div>]]></body></post><post id="p2193" date="Posted: Thu Nov 21, 2002 10:26 am "><author>Feffer</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">i think a tutorial on the particle system would be a dandy addition, as well as something on the gui interface stuff.

I thought about compiling everything i know in one big text file but i kinda shied away from that because its probably illegal and i didnt like putting a lot of effort into something that i cant freely distribute to help others. I would love to write some tutorials exclusively for doom3world but if people cant read it now it probably will be outdated by the time the game ships. Not that it wont be usefull, but it WILL be old and less precise then when it would be for immediate use. Im afraid the gap between now and shipping date is a bit too big. If you say you want to host stuff right now im all for it but i assume thats out of the question  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /><br /><br />GrtZ 3dioot

<br /><br />but how bout a tut on how to take what you know how to do... and getting more milage out of it.
<br /><br />It would be cool to make a map with various cool features, and then show what you used for where... and why... that sorta thing. It would be cool to see a tut more on the artistic side of mapping rather than a technical "this is how you do this" tutorial.
<br /><br />Lets face it... alot of mappers (me included) are artistically deprived. The doom mod community would definately appreciate some tuts on adding "style" to a map</div>]]></body></post><post id="p2181" date="Posted: Thu Nov 21, 2002 8:33 am "><author>3dioot</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Ophd,
<br /><br />You are very right about that. I doubt that im the right person for that though. Ive been doing 3d (offline rendering) for awhile now but im pretty new to mapping. Go here: 
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="viewtopic.php?t=245">http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=245</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />Many experienced mappers replied and it helped me alot. The best thing i can advise you is to look at the existing maps. You are trying to replicate the real world (even if its set in the future its still this real human world we are talking about) so try to abide to its rules. Build everything to scale, place fence's where you could fall and hurt yourself, place lights where you need to see a command panel or instrument, place small lights on the stairsteps or on the ground in a dark hallway so you will see where you have to put your feet and so on and so on. If you make everything serve a purpose you are halfway there. What also really helps is the decal's that you are able to use now. You can dirty stuff up. It can be machinery, the floor that is walked over alot, a wall that is open to air or wind or corrosion of any kind. Also try to work in layers. Layers of depth. Instead of having a clear see through from one end of the room to the other place stuff in your line of sight. I know it sounds kinda weird but this is really quite important. It can be flat planes with a grate texture or cables, a few simple boxes, a big pipe, a column. Try to make it big when you just start on your level. Your room has to look interesting to walk around in even before you start detailing. (i did that wrong in my level and im sorry now) Start with support structures. A ceiling wont stay up by itself. Neither will the walls. And use trims on everything. (that kinda falls into detailing). But really, 'finish' the geometry. A trim makes something solid. Makes it look like its build and strong. Its edge will be protected. If you dont use trims it will just look like the geometry is carved out of something solid. (at least thats my experience) Also the trims in d3 with the normal mapping will give nice bevelled edges to your geometry that catch highlights. Very cool!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />  The other half of level building is your idea where you want to go with the level, what should be in there.

Two thoughts spring to mind:
<br /><br />1.  Smoke, flame throwers etc. as i saw recently when i was poking around the page for Quake3 Fortress (a damn dandy mod if ever i have seen one).  Check out this page of their "look what we did":

<br /><br />2.  A recent movie on Everquest 2 was showing off different things that next-gen tech can do.  I am not a EQ fan but i like next gen tech.  I was not terribly impressed overall (D3 looks much better <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />) but in the movie there is a excerpt about about what they have done with the particle engine and there is some really clever stuff.  The movie can be downloaded from fileplanet (if you are a registered user) but i don't know where else to look for it.

<br /><br />Over a year and a half ago I downloaded the alpha. I toyed with it for a few days but while i was impressed with it's capablities, I quickly became bored with the content that was packaged with it. I wanted to make my own.
<br /><br />I found this site and while it had plenty of information it had nothing in the scripting section. I made a post about the sections lack of posts and how someone should write a tutorial. No one responded.
<br /><br />Instead of waiting for someone else to show me, I experimented with scripting commands and figured it out myself. Once I had a good understanding of how it worked, I wrote three tutorials on the subject.
<br /><br />I shared what I learned and I've recieved more positive comments than I ever expected. The funny thing is I am no different than any of you.
<br /><br />So, if you don't know how to do something and you can't find any help here, don't sit on the sidelines and wait for someone to write a tutorial. Toy with the alpha and figure it out, then document what you've learned. You'll gain tons of respect from the community and you can expect the same positive feedback from me.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p18182" date="Posted: Thu Feb 05, 2004 4:31 pm "><author>bullet</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">you do have a point. well, more than one, but that doesn't make up for your first point being a good one  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />so far my process has been: Think up something neat to do in a level.

						<div class="postbody">Hm, i like the tutorial idea. I thought about compiling everything i know in one big text file but i kinda shied away from that because its probably illegal and i didnt like putting a lot of effort into something that i cant freely distribute to help others. I would love to write some tutorials exclusively for doom3world but if people cant read it now it probably will be outdated by the time the game ships. Not that it wont be usefull, but it WILL be old and less precise then when it would be for immediate use. Im afraid the gap between now and shipping date is a bit too big. If you say you want to host stuff right now im all for it but i assume thats out of the question  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /><br /><br />GrtZ 3dioot
<br /><br /><br />PS
<br />I looked into some of the camera stuff today but i cant get any of it to work. It looks to me like some external tools were used (outside the editor). I can get a camera to run in my level but it isnt saved with it and im not able to trigger it either.</div>

						<div class="postbody">most tutorials are just about implementing engine features... and that is fine if you just want to learn how to implement more features.
<br /><br />but how bout a tut on how to take what you know how to do... and getting more milage out of it.
<br /><br />It would be cool to make a map with various cool features, and then show what you used for where... and why... that sorta thing. It would be cool to see a tut more on the artistic side of mapping rather than a technical "this is how you do this" tutorial.
<br /><br />Lets face it... alot of mappers (me included) are artistically deprived. The doom mod community would definately appreciate some tuts on adding "style" to a map</div>

						<div class="postbody">Ophd,
<br /><br />You are very right about that. I doubt that im the right person for that though. Ive been doing 3d (offline rendering) for awhile now but im pretty new to mapping. Go here: 
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="viewtopic.php?t=245">http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=245</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />Many experienced mappers replied and it helped me alot. The best thing i can advise you is to look at the existing maps. You are trying to replicate the real world (even if its set in the future its still this real human world we are talking about) so try to abide to its rules. Build everything to scale, place fence's where you could fall and hurt yourself, place lights where you need to see a command panel or instrument, place small lights on the stairsteps or on the ground in a dark hallway so you will see where you have to put your feet and so on and so on. If you make everything serve a purpose you are halfway there. What also really helps is the decal's that you are able to use now. You can dirty stuff up. It can be machinery, the floor that is walked over alot, a wall that is open to air or wind or corrosion of any kind. Also try to work in layers. Layers of depth. Instead of having a clear see through from one end of the room to the other place stuff in your line of sight. I know it sounds kinda weird but this is really quite important. It can be flat planes with a grate texture or cables, a few simple boxes, a big pipe, a column. Try to make it big when you just start on your level. Your room has to look interesting to walk around in even before you start detailing. (i did that wrong in my level and im sorry now) Start with support structures. A ceiling wont stay up by itself. Neither will the walls. And use trims on everything. (that kinda falls into detailing). But really, 'finish' the geometry. A trim makes something solid. Makes it look like its build and strong. Its edge will be protected. If you dont use trims it will just look like the geometry is carved out of something solid. (at least thats my experience) Also the trims in d3 with the normal mapping will give nice bevelled edges to your geometry that catch highlights. Very cool!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />  The other half of level building is your idea where you want to go with the level, what should be in there.

						<div class="postbody">Just a thought, but it would be nice to see not just the basic particles (like those seen in e3_3) but also other dandy things people come up with to do with particles.  Two thoughts spring to mind:
<br /><br />1.  Smoke, flame throwers etc. as i saw recently when i was poking around the page for Quake3 Fortress (a damn dandy mod if ever i have seen one).  Check out this page of their "look what we did":
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.q3f.com/shots_inprogress.html">http://www.q3f.com/shots_inprogress.html</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />2.  A recent movie on Everquest 2 was showing off different things that next-gen tech can do.  I am not a EQ fan but i like next gen tech.  I was not terribly impressed overall (D3 looks much better <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />) but in the movie there is a excerpt about about what they have done with the particle engine and there is some really clever stuff.  The movie can be downloaded from fileplanet (if you are a registered user) but i don't know where else to look for it.
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.fileplanet.com/files/110000/117121.shtml">http://www.fileplanet.com/files/110000/117121.shtml</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />Anyway, it would be nice to see tutorials on how to do some more outlandish stuff with the particles too.</div>

						<div class="postbody">All jokes aside, let me tell you a little story...
<br /><br />Over a year and a half ago I downloaded the alpha. I toyed with it for a few days but while i was impressed with it's capablities, I quickly became bored with the content that was packaged with it. I wanted to make my own.
<br /><br />I found this site and while it had plenty of information it had nothing in the scripting section. I made a post about the sections lack of posts and how someone should write a tutorial. No one responded.
<br /><br />Instead of waiting for someone else to show me, I experimented with scripting commands and figured it out myself. Once I had a good understanding of how it worked, I wrote three tutorials on the subject.
<br /><br />I shared what I learned and I've recieved more positive comments than I ever expected. The funny thing is I am no different than any of you.
<br /><br />So, if you don't know how to do something and you can't find any help here, don't sit on the sidelines and wait for someone to write a tutorial. Toy with the alpha and figure it out, then document what you've learned. You'll gain tons of respect from the community and you can expect the same positive feedback from me.</div>

Figure out how it works (if it works somewhere else somehow, even in reality, that helps). Trial &amp; Error all over the place. Eureka! Overuse new 'cool thing' to the point my computer makes odd noises. 
<br />I've been making more and more complex levels as I go. so far I haven't done anything that no one else knows how to do (that I know of), but my ideas are getting to be pretty far out there and I think I'll be doing a few things some time in the next couple of weeks that nobody's done before.

I would love to write some tutorials exclusively for doom3world but if people cant read it now it probably will be outdated by the time the game ships. Not that it wont be usefull, but it WILL be old and less precise then when it would be for immediate use. Im afraid the gap between now and shipping date is a bit too big. If you say you want to host stuff right now im all for it but i assume thats out of the question  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /><br /><br />GrtZ 3dioot

<br /><br />It would be cool to make a map with various cool features, and then show what you used for where... and why... that sorta thing. It would be cool to see a tut more on the artistic side of mapping rather than a technical "this is how you do this" tutorial.

<br /><br />You are very right about that. I doubt that im the right person for that though. Ive been doing 3d (offline rendering) for awhile now but im pretty new to mapping. Go here: 
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="viewtopic.php?t=245">http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=245</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />Many experienced mappers replied and it helped me alot. The best thing i can advise you is to look at the existing maps. You are trying to replicate the real world (even if its set in the future its still this real human world we are talking about) so try to abide to its rules. Build everything to scale, place fence's where you could fall and hurt yourself, place lights where you need to see a command panel or instrument, place small lights on the stairsteps or on the ground in a dark hallway so you will see where you have to put your feet and so on and so on. If you make everything serve a purpose you are halfway there. What also really helps is the decal's that you are able to use now. You can dirty stuff up. It can be machinery, the floor that is walked over alot, a wall that is open to air or wind or corrosion of any kind. Also try to work in layers. Layers of depth. Instead of having a clear see through from one end of the room to the other place stuff in your line of sight. I know it sounds kinda weird but this is really quite important. It can be flat planes with a grate texture or cables, a few simple boxes, a big pipe, a column. Try to make it big when you just start on your level. Your room has to look interesting to walk around in even before you start detailing. (i did that wrong in my level and im sorry now) Start with support structures. A ceiling wont stay up by itself. Neither will the walls. And use trims on everything. (that kinda falls into detailing). But really, 'finish' the geometry. A trim makes something solid. Makes it look like its build and strong. Its edge will be protected. If you dont use trims it will just look like the geometry is carved out of something solid. (at least thats my experience) Also the trims in d3 with the normal mapping will give nice bevelled edges to your geometry that catch highlights. Very cool!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />  The other half of level building is your idea where you want to go with the level, what should be in there.

<br /><br />2.  A recent movie on Everquest 2 was showing off different things that next-gen tech can do.  I am not a EQ fan but i like next gen tech.  I was not terribly impressed overall (D3 looks much better <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />) but in the movie there is a excerpt about about what they have done with the particle engine and there is some really clever stuff.  The movie can be downloaded from fileplanet (if you are a registered user) but i don't know where else to look for it.

<br /><br />Anyway, it would be nice to see tutorials on how to do some more outlandish stuff with the particles too.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p9987" date="Posted: Sat Jul 19, 2003 12:18 am "><author>bullet</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">elevators!! and how about one on lights, like how to use fog effectively so you don't just have a big cube of fog, which looks horrible if you're outside it. and maybe one on vis portals?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p10015" date="Posted: Sat Jul 19, 2003 1:08 pm "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">bullet wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">elevators!! and how about one on lights, like how to use fog effectively so you don't just have a big cube of fog, which looks horrible if you're outside it. and maybe one on vis portals?</div>

<br /><br />Over a year and a half ago I downloaded the alpha. I toyed with it for a few days but while i was impressed with it's capablities, I quickly became bored with the content that was packaged with it. I wanted to make my own.
<br /><br />I found this site and while it had plenty of information it had nothing in the scripting section. I made a post about the sections lack of posts and how someone should write a tutorial. No one responded.
<br /><br />Instead of waiting for someone else to show me, I experimented with scripting commands and figured it out myself. Once I had a good understanding of how it worked, I wrote three tutorials on the subject.
<br /><br />I shared what I learned and I've recieved more positive comments than I ever expected. The funny thing is I am no different than any of you.
<br /><br />So, if you don't know how to do something and you can't find any help here, don't sit on the sidelines and wait for someone to write a tutorial. Toy with the alpha and figure it out, then document what you've learned. You'll gain tons of respect from the community and you can expect the same positive feedback from me.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p18182" date="Posted: Thu Feb 05, 2004 4:31 pm "><author>bullet</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">you do have a point. well, more than one, but that doesn't make up for your first point being a good one  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />so far my process has been: Think up something neat to do in a level. Figure out how it works (if it works somewhere else somehow, even in reality, that helps). Trial &amp; Error all over the place. Eureka! Overuse new 'cool thing' to the point my computer makes odd noises. 
<br />I've been making more and more complex levels as I go. so far I haven't done anything that no one else knows how to do (that I know of), but my ideas are getting to be pretty far out there and I think I'll be doing a few things some time in the next couple of weeks that nobody's done before. If I actually understand what makes it work (if it works) then I'll start a thread on it!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p28360" date=""><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>

						<div class="postbody">Hm, i like the tutorial idea. I thought about compiling everything i know in one big text file but i kinda shied away from that because its probably illegal and i didnt like putting a lot of effort into something that i cant freely distribute to help others. I would love to write some tutorials exclusively for doom3world but if people cant read it now it probably will be outdated by the time the game ships. Not that it wont be usefull, but it WILL be old and less precise then when it would be for immediate use. Im afraid the gap between now and shipping date is a bit too big. If you say you want to host stuff right now im all for it but i assume thats out of the question  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /><br /><br />GrtZ 3dioot
<br /><br /><br />PS
<br />I looked into some of the camera stuff today but i cant get any of it to work. It looks to me like some external tools were used (outside the editor). I can get a camera to run in my level but it isnt saved with it and im not able to trigger it either.</div>

						<div class="postbody">most tutorials are just about implementing engine features... and that is fine if you just want to learn how to implement more features.
<br /><br />but how bout a tut on how to take what you know how to do... and getting more milage out of it.
<br /><br />It would be cool to make a map with various cool features, and then show what you used for where... and why... that sorta thing. It would be cool to see a tut more on the artistic side of mapping rather than a technical "this is how you do this" tutorial.
<br /><br />Lets face it... alot of mappers (me included) are artistically deprived. The doom mod community would definately appreciate some tuts on adding "style" to a map</div>

						<div class="postbody">Ophd,
<br /><br />You are very right about that. I doubt that im the right person for that though. Ive been doing 3d (offline rendering) for awhile now but im pretty new to mapping. Go here: 
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="viewtopic.php?t=245">http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=245</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />Many experienced mappers replied and it helped me alot. The best thing i can advise you is to look at the existing maps. You are trying to replicate the real world (even if its set in the future its still this real human world we are talking about) so try to abide to its rules. Build everything to scale, place fence's where you could fall and hurt yourself, place lights where you need to see a command panel or instrument, place small lights on the stairsteps or on the ground in a dark hallway so you will see where you have to put your feet and so on and so on. If you make everything serve a purpose you are halfway there. What also really helps is the decal's that you are able to use now. You can dirty stuff up. It can be machinery, the floor that is walked over alot, a wall that is open to air or wind or corrosion of any kind. Also try to work in layers. Layers of depth. Instead of having a clear see through from one end of the room to the other place stuff in your line of sight. I know it sounds kinda weird but this is really quite important. It can be flat planes with a grate texture or cables, a few simple boxes, a big pipe, a column. Try to make it big when you just start on your level. Your room has to look interesting to walk around in even before you start detailing. (i did that wrong in my level and im sorry now) Start with support structures. A ceiling wont stay up by itself. Neither will the walls. And use trims on everything. (that kinda falls into detailing). But really, 'finish' the geometry. A trim makes something solid. Makes it look like its build and strong. Its edge will be protected. If you dont use trims it will just look like the geometry is carved out of something solid. (at least thats my experience) Also the trims in d3 with the normal mapping will give nice bevelled edges to your geometry that catch highlights. Very cool!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />  The other half of level building is your idea where you want to go with the level, what should be in there.

						<div class="postbody">Just a thought, but it would be nice to see not just the basic particles (like those seen in e3_3) but also other dandy things people come up with to do with particles.  Two thoughts spring to mind:
<br /><br />1.  Smoke, flame throwers etc. as i saw recently when i was poking around the page for Quake3 Fortress (a damn dandy mod if ever i have seen one).  Check out this page of their "look what we did":
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.q3f.com/shots_inprogress.html">http://www.q3f.com/shots_inprogress.html</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />2.  A recent movie on Everquest 2 was showing off different things that next-gen tech can do.  I am not a EQ fan but i like next gen tech.  I was not terribly impressed overall (D3 looks much better <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />) but in the movie there is a excerpt about about what they have done with the particle engine and there is some really clever stuff.  The movie can be downloaded from fileplanet (if you are a registered user) but i don't know where else to look for it.
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.fileplanet.com/files/110000/117121.shtml">http://www.fileplanet.com/files/110000/117121.shtml</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />Anyway, it would be nice to see tutorials on how to do some more outlandish stuff with the particles too.</div>

I thought about compiling everything i know in one big text file but i kinda shied away from that because its probably illegal and i didnt like putting a lot of effort into something that i cant freely distribute to help others. I would love to write some tutorials exclusively for doom3world but if people cant read it now it probably will be outdated by the time the game ships. Not that it wont be usefull, but it WILL be old and less precise then when it would be for immediate use. Im afraid the gap between now and shipping date is a bit too big. If you say you want to host stuff right now im all for it but i assume thats out of the question  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /><br /><br />GrtZ 3dioot

<br /><br />It would be cool to make a map with various cool features, and then show what you used for where... and why... that sorta thing. It would be cool to see a tut more on the artistic side of mapping rather than a technical "this is how you do this" tutorial.

<br /><br />You are very right about that. I doubt that im the right person for that though. Ive been doing 3d (offline rendering) for awhile now but im pretty new to mapping. Go here: 
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="viewtopic.php?t=245">http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=245</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />Many experienced mappers replied and it helped me alot. The best thing i can advise you is to look at the existing maps. You are trying to replicate the real world (even if its set in the future its still this real human world we are talking about) so try to abide to its rules. Build everything to scale, place fence's where you could fall and hurt yourself, place lights where you need to see a command panel or instrument, place small lights on the stairsteps or on the ground in a dark hallway so you will see where you have to put your feet and so on and so on. If you make everything serve a purpose you are halfway there. What also really helps is the decal's that you are able to use now. You can dirty stuff up. It can be machinery, the floor that is walked over alot, a wall that is open to air or wind or corrosion of any kind. Also try to work in layers. Layers of depth. Instead of having a clear see through from one end of the room to the other place stuff in your line of sight. I know it sounds kinda weird but this is really quite important. It can be flat planes with a grate texture or cables, a few simple boxes, a big pipe, a column. Try to make it big when you just start on your level. Your room has to look interesting to walk around in even before you start detailing. (i did that wrong in my level and im sorry now) Start with support structures. A ceiling wont stay up by itself. Neither will the walls. And use trims on everything. (that kinda falls into detailing). But really, 'finish' the geometry. A trim makes something solid. Makes it look like its build and strong. Its edge will be protected. If you dont use trims it will just look like the geometry is carved out of something solid. (at least thats my experience) Also the trims in d3 with the normal mapping will give nice bevelled edges to your geometry that catch highlights. Very cool!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />  The other half of level building is your idea where you want to go with the level, what should be in there.

Two thoughts spring to mind:
<br /><br />1.  Smoke, flame throwers etc. as i saw recently when i was poking around the page for Quake3 Fortress (a damn dandy mod if ever i have seen one).  Check out this page of their "look what we did":

<br /><br />2.  A recent movie on Everquest 2 was showing off different things that next-gen tech can do.  I am not a EQ fan but i like next gen tech.  I was not terribly impressed overall (D3 looks much better <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />) but in the movie there is a excerpt about about what they have done with the particle engine and there is some really clever stuff.  The movie can be downloaded from fileplanet (if you are a registered user) but i don't know where else to look for it.

						<div class="postbody">Hm, i like the tutorial idea. I thought about compiling everything i know in one big text file but i kinda shied away from that because its probably illegal and i didnt like putting a lot of effort into something that i cant freely distribute to help others. I would love to write some tutorials exclusively for doom3world but if people cant read it now it probably will be outdated by the time the game ships. Not that it wont be usefull, but it WILL be old and less precise then when it would be for immediate use. Im afraid the gap between now and shipping date is a bit too big. If you say you want to host stuff right now im all for it but i assume thats out of the question  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /><br /><br />GrtZ 3dioot
<br /><br /><br />PS
<br />I looked into some of the camera stuff today but i cant get any of it to work. It looks to me like some external tools were used (outside the editor). I can get a camera to run in my level but it isnt saved with it and im not able to trigger it either.</div>

						<div class="postbody">most tutorials are just about implementing engine features... and that is fine if you just want to learn how to implement more features.
<br /><br />but how bout a tut on how to take what you know how to do... and getting more milage out of it.
<br /><br />It would be cool to make a map with various cool features, and then show what you used for where... and why... that sorta thing. It would be cool to see a tut more on the artistic side of mapping rather than a technical "this is how you do this" tutorial.
<br /><br />Lets face it... alot of mappers (me included) are artistically deprived. The doom mod community would definately appreciate some tuts on adding "style" to a map</div>

						<div class="postbody">Ophd,
<br /><br />You are very right about that. I doubt that im the right person for that though. Ive been doing 3d (offline rendering) for awhile now but im pretty new to mapping. Go here: 
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="viewtopic.php?t=245">http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=245</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />Many experienced mappers replied and it helped me alot. The best thing i can advise you is to look at the existing maps. You are trying to replicate the real world (even if its set in the future its still this real human world we are talking about) so try to abide to its rules. Build everything to scale, place fence's where you could fall and hurt yourself, place lights where you need to see a command panel or instrument, place small lights on the stairsteps or on the ground in a dark hallway so you will see where you have to put your feet and so on and so on. If you make everything serve a purpose you are halfway there. What also really helps is the decal's that you are able to use now. You can dirty stuff up. It can be machinery, the floor that is walked over alot, a wall that is open to air or wind or corrosion of any kind. Also try to work in layers. Layers of depth. Instead of having a clear see through from one end of the room to the other place stuff in your line of sight. I know it sounds kinda weird but this is really quite important. It can be flat planes with a grate texture or cables, a few simple boxes, a big pipe, a column. Try to make it big when you just start on your level. Your room has to look interesting to walk around in even before you start detailing. (i did that wrong in my level and im sorry now) Start with support structures. A ceiling wont stay up by itself. Neither will the walls. And use trims on everything. (that kinda falls into detailing). But really, 'finish' the geometry. A trim makes something solid. Makes it look like its build and strong. Its edge will be protected. If you dont use trims it will just look like the geometry is carved out of something solid. (at least thats my experience) Also the trims in d3 with the normal mapping will give nice bevelled edges to your geometry that catch highlights. Very cool!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />  The other half of level building is your idea where you want to go with the level, what should be in there.

						<div class="postbody">Just a thought, but it would be nice to see not just the basic particles (like those seen in e3_3) but also other dandy things people come up with to do with particles.  Two thoughts spring to mind:
<br /><br />1.  Smoke, flame throwers etc. as i saw recently when i was poking around the page for Quake3 Fortress (a damn dandy mod if ever i have seen one).  Check out this page of their "look what we did":
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.q3f.com/shots_inprogress.html">http://www.q3f.com/shots_inprogress.html</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />2.  A recent movie on Everquest 2 was showing off different things that next-gen tech can do.  I am not a EQ fan but i like next gen tech.  I was not terribly impressed overall (D3 looks much better <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />) but in the movie there is a excerpt about about what they have done with the particle engine and there is some really clever stuff.  The movie can be downloaded from fileplanet (if you are a registered user) but i don't know where else to look for it.
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.fileplanet.com/files/110000/117121.shtml">http://www.fileplanet.com/files/110000/117121.shtml</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />Anyway, it would be nice to see tutorials on how to do some more outlandish stuff with the particles too.</div>

						<div class="postbody">All jokes aside, let me tell you a little story...
<br /><br />Over a year and a half ago I downloaded the alpha. I toyed with it for a few days but while i was impressed with it's capablities, I quickly became bored with the content that was packaged with it. I wanted to make my own.
<br /><br />I found this site and while it had plenty of information it had nothing in the scripting section. I made a post about the sections lack of posts and how someone should write a tutorial. No one responded.
<br /><br />Instead of waiting for someone else to show me, I experimented with scripting commands and figured it out myself. Once I had a good understanding of how it worked, I wrote three tutorials on the subject.
<br /><br />I shared what I learned and I've recieved more positive comments than I ever expected. The funny thing is I am no different than any of you.
<br /><br />So, if you don't know how to do something and you can't find any help here, don't sit on the sidelines and wait for someone to write a tutorial. Toy with the alpha and figure it out, then document what you've learned. You'll gain tons of respect from the community and you can expect the same positive feedback from me.</div>

<br />I've been making more and more complex levels as I go. so far I haven't done anything that no one else knows how to do (that I know of), but my ideas are getting to be pretty far out there and I think I'll be doing a few things some time in the next couple of weeks that nobody's done before.

The best thing i can advise you is to look at the existing maps. You are trying to replicate the real world (even if its set in the future its still this real human world we are talking about) so try to abide to its rules. Build everything to scale, place fence's where you could fall and hurt yourself, place lights where you need to see a command panel or instrument, place small lights on the stairsteps or on the ground in a dark hallway so you will see where you have to put your feet and so on and so on. If you make everything serve a purpose you are halfway there. What also really helps is the decal's that you are able to use now. You can dirty stuff up. It can be machinery, the floor that is walked over alot, a wall that is open to air or wind or corrosion of any kind. Also try to work in layers. Layers of depth. Instead of having a clear see through from one end of the room to the other place stuff in your line of sight. I know it sounds kinda weird but this is really quite important. It can be flat planes with a grate texture or cables, a few simple boxes, a big pipe, a column. Try to make it big when you just start on your level. Your room has to look interesting to walk around in even before you start detailing. (i did that wrong in my level and im sorry now) Start with support structures. A ceiling wont stay up by itself. Neither will the walls. And use trims on everything. (that kinda falls into detailing). But really, 'finish' the geometry. A trim makes something solid. Makes it look like its build and strong. Its edge will be protected. If you dont use trims it will just look like the geometry is carved out of something solid. (at least thats my experience) Also the trims in d3 with the normal mapping will give nice bevelled edges to your geometry that catch highlights. Very cool!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />  The other half of level building is your idea where you want to go with the level, what should be in there. &#13;<br /><br />GrtZ 3dioot</div>]]></body></post><post id="p2193" date="Posted: Thu Nov 21, 2002 10:26 am "><author>Feffer</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">i think a tutorial on the particle system would be a dandy addition, as well as something on the gui interface stuff.

I toyed with it for a few days but while i was impressed with it's capablities, I quickly became bored with the content that was packaged with it. I wanted to make my own.&#13;<br /><br />I found this site and while it had plenty of information it had nothing in the scripting section. I made a post about the sections lack of posts and how someone should write a tutorial. No one responded.&#13;<br /><br />Instead of waiting for someone else to show me, I experimented with scripting commands and figured it out myself. Once I had a good understanding of how it worked, I wrote three tutorials on the subject.&#13;<br /><br />I shared what I learned and I've recieved more positive comments than I ever expected. The funny thing is I am no different than any of you.&#13;<br /><br />So, if you don't know how to do something and you can't find any help here, don't sit on the sidelines and wait for someone to write a tutorial. Toy with the alpha and figure it out, then document what you've learned. You'll gain tons of respect from the community and you can expect the same positive feedback from me.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p18182" date="Posted: Thu Feb 05, 2004 4:31 pm "><author>bullet</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">you do have a point. well, more than one, but that doesn't make up for your first point being a good one  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />so far my process has been: Think up something neat to do in a level.

<br /><br />2.  A recent movie on Everquest 2 was showing off different things that next-gen tech can do.  I am not a EQ fan but i like next gen tech.  I was not terribly impressed overall (D3 looks much better <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />) but in the movie there is a excerpt about about what they have done with the particle engine and there is some really clever stuff.  The movie can be downloaded from fileplanet (if you are a registered user) but i don't know where else to look for it.

<br /><br />Anyway, it would be nice to see tutorials on how to do some more outlandish stuff with the particles too.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p9987" date="Posted: Sat Jul 19, 2003 12:18 am "><author>bullet</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">elevators!! and how about one on lights, like how to use fog effectively so you don't just have a big cube of fog, which looks horrible if you're outside it. and maybe one on vis portals?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p10015" date="Posted: Sat Jul 19, 2003 1:08 pm "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">bullet wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">elevators!! and how about one on lights, like how to use fog effectively so you don't just have a big cube of fog, which looks horrible if you're outside it. and maybe one on vis portals?</div>

<br /><br />Over a year and a half ago I downloaded the alpha. I toyed with it for a few days but while i was impressed with it's capablities, I quickly became bored with the content that was packaged with it. I wanted to make my own.
<br /><br />I found this site and while it had plenty of information it had nothing in the scripting section. I made a post about the sections lack of posts and how someone should write a tutorial. No one responded.
<br /><br />Instead of waiting for someone else to show me, I experimented with scripting commands and figured it out myself. Once I had a good understanding of how it worked, I wrote three tutorials on the subject.
<br /><br />I shared what I learned and I've recieved more positive comments than I ever expected. The funny thing is I am no different than any of you.
<br /><br />So, if you don't know how to do something and you can't find any help here, don't sit on the sidelines and wait for someone to write a tutorial. Toy with the alpha and figure it out, then document what you've learned. You'll gain tons of respect from the community and you can expect the same positive feedback from me.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p18182" date="Posted: Thu Feb 05, 2004 4:31 pm "><author>bullet</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">you do have a point. well, more than one, but that doesn't make up for your first point being a good one  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />so far my process has been: Think up something neat to do in a level. Figure out how it works (if it works somewhere else somehow, even in reality, that helps). Trial &amp; Error all over the place. Eureka! Overuse new 'cool thing' to the point my computer makes odd noises. 
<br />I've been making more and more complex levels as I go. so far I haven't done anything that no one else knows how to do (that I know of), but my ideas are getting to be pretty far out there and I think I'll be doing a few things some time in the next couple of weeks that nobody's done before. If I actually understand what makes it work (if it works) then I'll start a thread on it!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p28360" date=""><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>

						<div class="postbody">Hm, i like the tutorial idea. I thought about compiling everything i know in one big text file but i kinda shied away from that because its probably illegal and i didnt like putting a lot of effort into something that i cant freely distribute to help others. I would love to write some tutorials exclusively for doom3world but if people cant read it now it probably will be outdated by the time the game ships. Not that it wont be usefull, but it WILL be old and less precise then when it would be for immediate use. Im afraid the gap between now and shipping date is a bit too big. If you say you want to host stuff right now im all for it but i assume thats out of the question  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /><br /><br />GrtZ 3dioot
<br /><br /><br />PS
<br />I looked into some of the camera stuff today but i cant get any of it to work. It looks to me like some external tools were used (outside the editor). I can get a camera to run in my level but it isnt saved with it and im not able to trigger it either.</div>

						<div class="postbody">most tutorials are just about implementing engine features... and that is fine if you just want to learn how to implement more features.
<br /><br />but how bout a tut on how to take what you know how to do... and getting more milage out of it.
<br /><br />It would be cool to make a map with various cool features, and then show what you used for where... and why... that sorta thing. It would be cool to see a tut more on the artistic side of mapping rather than a technical "this is how you do this" tutorial.
<br /><br />Lets face it... alot of mappers (me included) are artistically deprived. The doom mod community would definately appreciate some tuts on adding "style" to a map</div>

						<div class="postbody">Ophd,
<br /><br />You are very right about that. I doubt that im the right person for that though. Ive been doing 3d (offline rendering) for awhile now but im pretty new to mapping. Go here: 
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="viewtopic.php?t=245">http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=245</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />Many experienced mappers replied and it helped me alot. The best thing i can advise you is to look at the existing maps. You are trying to replicate the real world (even if its set in the future its still this real human world we are talking about) so try to abide to its rules. Build everything to scale, place fence's where you could fall and hurt yourself, place lights where you need to see a command panel or instrument, place small lights on the stairsteps or on the ground in a dark hallway so you will see where you have to put your feet and so on and so on. If you make everything serve a purpose you are halfway there. What also really helps is the decal's that you are able to use now. You can dirty stuff up. It can be machinery, the floor that is walked over alot, a wall that is open to air or wind or corrosion of any kind. Also try to work in layers. Layers of depth. Instead of having a clear see through from one end of the room to the other place stuff in your line of sight. I know it sounds kinda weird but this is really quite important. It can be flat planes with a grate texture or cables, a few simple boxes, a big pipe, a column. Try to make it big when you just start on your level. Your room has to look interesting to walk around in even before you start detailing. (i did that wrong in my level and im sorry now) Start with support structures. A ceiling wont stay up by itself. Neither will the walls. And use trims on everything. (that kinda falls into detailing). But really, 'finish' the geometry. A trim makes something solid. Makes it look like its build and strong. Its edge will be protected. If you dont use trims it will just look like the geometry is carved out of something solid. (at least thats my experience) Also the trims in d3 with the normal mapping will give nice bevelled edges to your geometry that catch highlights. Very cool!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />  The other half of level building is your idea where you want to go with the level, what should be in there.

						<div class="postbody">Just a thought, but it would be nice to see not just the basic particles (like those seen in e3_3) but also other dandy things people come up with to do with particles.  Two thoughts spring to mind:
<br /><br />1.  Smoke, flame throwers etc. as i saw recently when i was poking around the page for Quake3 Fortress (a damn dandy mod if ever i have seen one).  Check out this page of their "look what we did":
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.q3f.com/shots_inprogress.html">http://www.q3f.com/shots_inprogress.html</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />2.  A recent movie on Everquest 2 was showing off different things that next-gen tech can do.  I am not a EQ fan but i like next gen tech.  I was not terribly impressed overall (D3 looks much better <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />) but in the movie there is a excerpt about about what they have done with the particle engine and there is some really clever stuff.  The movie can be downloaded from fileplanet (if you are a registered user) but i don't know where else to look for it.
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.fileplanet.com/files/110000/117121.shtml">http://www.fileplanet.com/files/110000/117121.shtml</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />Anyway, it would be nice to see tutorials on how to do some more outlandish stuff with the particles too.</div>

						<div class="postbody">All jokes aside, let me tell you a little story...
<br /><br />Over a year and a half ago I downloaded the alpha. I toyed with it for a few days but while i was impressed with it's capablities, I quickly became bored with the content that was packaged with it. I wanted to make my own.
<br /><br />I found this site and while it had plenty of information it had nothing in the scripting section. I made a post about the sections lack of posts and how someone should write a tutorial. No one responded.
<br /><br />Instead of waiting for someone else to show me, I experimented with scripting commands and figured it out myself. Once I had a good understanding of how it worked, I wrote three tutorials on the subject.
<br /><br />I shared what I learned and I've recieved more positive comments than I ever expected. The funny thing is I am no different than any of you.
<br /><br />So, if you don't know how to do something and you can't find any help here, don't sit on the sidelines and wait for someone to write a tutorial. Toy with the alpha and figure it out, then document what you've learned. You'll gain tons of respect from the community and you can expect the same positive feedback from me.</div>

						<div class="postbody">you do have a point. well, more than one, but that doesn't make up for your first point being a good one  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />so far my process has been: Think up something neat to do in a level. Figure out how it works (if it works somewhere else somehow, even in reality, that helps). Trial &amp; Error all over the place. Eureka! Overuse new 'cool thing' to the point my computer makes odd noises. 
<br />I've been making more and more complex levels as I go. so far I haven't done anything that no one else knows how to do (that I know of), but my ideas are getting to be pretty far out there and I think I'll be doing a few things some time in the next couple of weeks that nobody's done before. If I actually understand what makes it work (if it works) then I'll start a thread on it!</div>
