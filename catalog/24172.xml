To use custom textures for the lens flare, just change the textures in the material. To change the positions and number of flares, you'd have to edit the code and compile a new dll.

I found that when I changed to "Ultra", something changed which caused my FPS to decrease significantly.<br /><br />Also, just for kicks, I turned on soft shadows in addition to HDR (and the other aforementioned settings). I was pleasantly surprised that I still got around 60 FPS with occasional dips into the low-mid forties in demanding scenes.<br /><br />One thing I noticed is that when I first enter a demanding scene, the FPS might tank down to 30, but then it rises right back up to 40-45 or so. Why does this happen? Is my computer at fault, or could this be a power saving feature of my CPU or GPU at work? Or is it just the nature of this mod?

That seems to work. The Sikkmod options all work in-game. I place the Monoaxed folders in the Sikkmod folder. No idea if that's working. This is where things start to annoy me. The Wulfen texture pack is a PK4 file. From various instructions I've found online it tells me to just place the PK4 file in the Sikkmod folder. I do this and I don't notice a difference. I don't think they're loading. Also, when changing the resolution in the DoomConfig I have it set as:<br /><br />customwidth = 1440<br />customheight = 900<br />r_mode = -1<br />aspectratio = 2<br /><br />Yet the settings remain like that in the config, I loaded up the game and it seems to be stuck on the default resolution.<br /><br />Then I have a the Parallax mod 2.0 which is also a PK4 file. I placed that in the Sikkmod folder. No idea if it's working. I only got the texture pack to work once after downloading somebody else's config file, extracting the Wulfen folders out of the PK4 into the Sikkmod folder (while keeping the PK4 there as well), and changing the resolution in the new config. After removing Sikkmod and the texture packs then trying to install the mods from scratch, I couldn't get it to work or it was all dark, or I had graphical issues.<br /><br />I can't imagine this is that difficult to install. I'm either an idiot and not installing something correctly or something just isn't right. Either way it's annoying.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p246532" date="Posted: Thu Feb 07, 2013 12:20 am "><author>Sikkpin</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I don't have the various texture packs so I don't know what they contain or their structure but I'll do my best to help.<br /><br />I'll deal with the resolution first.

I could try creating an autoexec, never thought of that. I'm at work currently so I can't check anything right now but if memory serves then the folders from the Monoaxed rar file were "materials" and "textures" I believe. I just placed them in the Sikkmod folder. Also I think the usePrecompressedTextures was set to 1 as default. I can easily change that. Should I load up the normal game first and set up the ultra quality along with the regular resolution settings, the regular antistrophic filtering, controls, and anything else I need before loading Sikkmod? Or should I change those settings with Sikkmod activated?<br /><br />I also find it boggling that after extracting the Wulfen folders and files OUT of the PK4 file and downloading someone else's config, it seemed to work. Though I did notice a weird transparent box around certain lighting. But that's another issue. I first need to get it to work again. If putting the PK4 files in the Sikkmod folder is all I need to do then I was right by following all the instructions I've seen. Then that means I should be able to put the parallax mod PK4 file and the parallax fix PK4 file in there as well. Also, I read somewhere there were 2 files I needed to copy from the "pom" folder into the main "glprogs" folder to get parallax lighting to work, correct?<br /><br />Edit: I just got home and am trying this again.

To use custom textures for the lens flare, just change the textures in the material. To change the positions and number of flares, you'd have to edit the code and compile a new dll.

To use custom textures for the lens flare, just change the textures in the material. To change the positions and number of flares, you'd have to edit the code and compile a new dll. As for sun shafts, there really isn't much more you can do. This isn't Crysis, after all, and my options are extremely limited.

If you're basing this off of the fact the the shaders are listed twice in the console when loaded, that's because one is for the vertex program and the other is for the fragment program.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p244694" date="Posted: Tue Dec 04, 2012 12:36 am "><author>Lord_Kane</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Question. <br /><br />I know its late, but. <br /><br />is Sikkmod 1.2 going to ever come out for Resurrection of evil? <br /><br />probably not since its been a while <br /><br />cant hurt to ask.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p246408" date="Posted: Thu Jan 31, 2013 11:43 am "><author>MATTEO</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="color: #0000FF">THANKS Sikkpin</span></span> for your incredible work on this mod .. with <span style="font-weight: bold">SIKKMOD 1.2</span> , <span style="color: #BF0080">Doom 3 is really impressive !!</span>  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319220802im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil" /><br /><br /><br />M.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p246531" date="Posted: Wed Feb 06, 2013 10:54 pm "><author>Raptomex</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I currently have Sikkmod v1.2, Monoaxed textures, Wulfen Texture pack 2.0.<br /><br />I place the Sikkmod folder in my Doom 3 directory. That seems to work. The Sikkmod options all work in-game. I place the Monoaxed folders in the Sikkmod folder. No idea if that's working. This is where things start to annoy me. The Wulfen texture pack is a PK4 file. From various instructions I've found online it tells me to just place the PK4 file in the Sikkmod folder. I do this and I don't notice a difference. I don't think they're loading. Also, when changing the resolution in the DoomConfig I have it set as:<br /><br />customwidth = 1440<br />customheight = 900<br />r_mode = -1<br />aspectratio = 2<br /><br />Yet the settings remain like that in the config, I loaded up the game and it seems to be stuck on the default resolution.<br /><br />Then I have a the Parallax mod 2.0 which is also a PK4 file. I placed that in the Sikkmod folder. No idea if it's working. I only got the texture pack to work once after downloading somebody else's config file, extracting the Wulfen folders out of the PK4 into the Sikkmod folder (while keeping the PK4 there as well), and changing the resolution in the new config. After removing Sikkmod and the texture packs then trying to install the mods from scratch, I couldn't get it to work or it was all dark, or I had graphical issues.<br /><br />I can't imagine this is that difficult to install. I'm either an idiot and not installing something correctly or something just isn't right. Either way it's annoying.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p246532" date="Posted: Thu Feb 07, 2013 12:20 am "><author>Sikkpin</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I don't have the various texture packs so I don't know what they contain or their structure but I'll do my best to help.<br /><br />I'll deal with the resolution first.

I could try creating an autoexec, never thought of that. I'm at work currently so I can't check anything right now but if memory serves then the folders from the Monoaxed rar file were "materials" and "textures" I believe. I just placed them in the Sikkmod folder. Also I think the usePrecompressedTextures was set to 1 as default. I can easily change that. Should I load up the normal game first and set up the ultra quality along with the regular resolution settings, the regular antistrophic filtering, controls, and anything else I need before loading Sikkmod? Or should I change those settings with Sikkmod activated?<br /><br />I also find it boggling that after extracting the Wulfen folders and files OUT of the PK4 file and downloading someone else's config, it seemed to work. Though I did notice a weird transparent box around certain lighting. But that's another issue. I first need to get it to work again. If putting the PK4 files in the Sikkmod folder is all I need to do then I was right by following all the instructions I've seen. Then that means I should be able to put the parallax mod PK4 file and the parallax fix PK4 file in there as well. Also, I read somewhere there were 2 files I needed to copy from the "pom" folder into the main "glprogs" folder to get parallax lighting to work, correct?<br /><br />Edit: I just got home and am trying this again. And I can now confirm the folders in the Monoaxed rar are "textures" and "materials" and I placed them in the Sikkmod folder.<br /><br />I can confirm this is correct:<br />image_useCompression "0"<br />seta image_usePrecompressedTextures "0"<br />seta image_useNormalCompression "0"<br /><br />I also have an autoexec with these commands<br /><br />seta r_customHeight "900"<br />seta r_customWidth "1440"<br />seta r_fullscreen "1"<br />seta r_mode "-1"<br />seta r_aspectRatio "2"<br /><br />Ok I installed everything and this is what happens:<br /><br />Here is screenshot of my Sikkmod folder: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319220802/http://imgur.com/seoVUjU" class="postlink">http://imgur.com/seoVUjU</a><br />When I enable HDR: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319220802/http://i.imgur.com/5WLenFb.jpg" class="postlink">http://i.imgur.com/5WLenFb.jpg</a><br />No Hi-res textures load: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319220802/http://i.imgur.com/G1FHjSs.jpg" class="postlink">http://i.imgur.com/G1FHjSs.jpg</a> (Looking back now maybe they did load?)<br />When I turn on SSAO: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319220802/http://i.imgur.com/AyEmD8Y.jpg" class="postlink">http://i.imgur.com/AyEmD8Y.jpg</a><br /><br />When I turn on motion blur it produces this weird graphical pop in thing whenever I move.<br /><br />Update:<br />After checking some things online it seems when I changed this setting to "0", I THINK the hi-res textures are loading.<br /><br />seta image_downSize "0"<br /><br />But I get these weird shadows:<br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319220802/http://i.imgur.com/5TUmNnz.jpg" class="postlink">http://i.imgur.com/5TUmNnz.jpg</a><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319220802/http://i.imgur.com/7Fros7M.jpg" class="postlink">http://i.imgur.com/7Fros7M.jpg</a><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319220802/http://i.imgur.com/3SZIFTa.jpg" class="postlink">http://i.imgur.com/3SZIFTa.jpg</a><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319220802/http://i.imgur.com/qzPzJoh.jpg" class="postlink">http://i.imgur.com/qzPzJoh.jpg</a><br /><br />I think I got something working but I don't think the textures are loading:<br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319220802/http://i.imgur.com/wOoUlou.jpg" class="postlink">http://i.imgur.com/wOoUlou.jpg</a><br /><br />After I downloaded Wulfen Textures v1.0 which were just folders that needed to be extracted into the Sikkmod folder I think the textures loaded:<br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319220802/http://i.imgur.com/Lixoro0.jpg" class="postlink">http://i.imgur.com/Lixoro0.jpg</a><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319220802/http://i.imgur.com/z1sZj2t.jpg" class="postlink">http://i.imgur.com/z1sZj2t.jpg</a><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319220802/http://i.imgur.com/2ts5VXh.jpg" class="postlink">http://i.imgur.com/2ts5VXh.jpg</a><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319220802/http://i.imgur.com/Z3NbLrF.jpg" class="postlink">http://i.imgur.com/Z3NbLrF.jpg</a></div>]]></body></post><post id="p246575" date="Posted: Fri Feb 08, 2013 10:27 pm "><author>Raptomex</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I got so fed up I just ended up installing from the disk then installing the Doom 3 HD mod.
