<br /><br />The enforcers glide like ice skaters. Very graceful!
<br /><br />Enemies with too much health. Hard to kill off what should be cannonfodder.
<br /><br />Dropships that shoot at me! The game is already tough enough on Normal!
<br /><br />Not enough health.
<br /><br />Saving and loading don't work on the Main Menu.
<br /><br />The chaingun guys are weird-looking. I liked them when they were comically short and stalky. I called them George, after George Castanza from Seinfeld.
<br /><br />Sound effects aren't very high-quality. Try shooting for Doom 3 sound quality as much as you can.
<br /><br />Needs better voice acting. Couldn't stop laughing at the "Intruder Alert" sound. Everyone kinda slurs as they make noise.
<br /><br />No crosshair. I can't aim by myself worth a damn. <img src="/web/20100702042935im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><br /><br />On to the good comments.
<br /><br />Map design is excellent. My specs are P4 2.8 Ghz, GeForce 6600gt, and 1.5GB RAM. I noticed a bit of chopiness, but I don't see that as bad. Clearly, you're looking towards the future of gaming by pushing this engine's limits. Half of the responsibility goes into the mapper's optimization techniques while the other half is for the gamers to keep their PCs upgraded for the games they want.
<br /><br />Weapons look nice. (Shotgun could have slightly faster rate-of-fire, though)
<br /><br />Some music was good.
<br /><br />Keep up the good work, Kiltron and Crew.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p108489" date="Posted: Tue Aug 16, 2005 3:24 pm "><author>Kiltron</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I appreciate all the feedback from everyone.

<br /><br />It's finally here. The highly anticipated release of the Quake II: Lost Marine QuakeCon 2005 Test Build for DOOM 3. Get your guns and gear ready for this action packed remix of Quake II within the DOOM 3 engine. Engage in high combat situations in all new areas with all new gameplay. Fight various Strogg enemies along your way including Enforcers, Light Guards and Flyers. Take them out with your Blaster, Double Barrel Shotgun, or other aresenal that you come across. Find secrets and secret areas and powerups. Unlock secret extra content, and much more!
<br /><br />This is a Single Player Demo only. This is not the full or final polished release of the mod. This is only a test build, for progress showing and bug feedback reporting. There are still things we need to finish, including animations, code, art etc. It's packaged in a Windows Installer and is also ready for burning a backup copy of the mod to CD. Don't forget to grab your CD Labels on the Downloads page as well.
<br /><br />It's been a tough 4 months developing this demo, but I promised to have something playable by QuakeCon 2005 and I delivered on that promise. Everyone did an excellent job. So without further delay, go download the mod and kick some Strogg ass!

<br /><br />After the first loading screen it took me a few seconds to realize it wasn't Quake 2, which is a good thing.
<br /><br />It's a little sluggish on my rig but I'm more to blame for that than you. I realize that you're using more lights than the stock Doom 3 maps in order to make the levels in the mod well lit so it's a given that performance won't be quite as good.
<br /><br />The only real gripe I have is the installer, as you aren't prompted for the location of Doom 3. It just assumes that you've installed Doom 3 in C:\Program Files\Doom 3\ which means you have to move the mod and change the shortcut.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107592" date="Posted: Wed Aug 10, 2005 8:54 am "><author>psyborg</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">been playing it quite for a good while now. heres my critique
<br /><br />mapping: brilliant, although a little chuggy in some spots i had to turn video settings to medium.
<br /><br />weapons: very good, love them.
<br /><br />enemies: they all look good but the light enforcer needs more animation alot of the time he seems to be gliding around, and have him aim his gun higher looks like hes pointing it downward. flyer and enforcer are great. 
<br /><br />items: they look good but i dont like the way they light up, looks weird.
<br /><br />presentation/installer/gui: very professional
<br /><br />music: awesome
<br /><br />for a test build its very fun and really cool but needs a little more work, cant wait for the finished product.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107593" date="Posted: Wed Aug 10, 2005 8:55 am "><author>doomkid3000</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Im Very Impressed <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225040221im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil" /><br />how do you turn crosshairs on</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107596" date="Posted: Wed Aug 10, 2005 9:46 am "><author>Petter</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">downloading!!!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107597" date="Posted: Wed Aug 10, 2005 9:50 am "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Guess that qualifies for news - congrats!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107599" date="Posted: Wed Aug 10, 2005 10:11 am "><author>Petter</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I get bumped out on my desktop when tryign to execute the exe file, it also happens if i try to open it in the mods in doom3.

(Though I followed their directions to a T, there's checkboxes they say to use missing from my application so I was at a loss on what to do)
<br /><br />You can choose any path you want to install to, and the mod will install to it, it just doesn't update the path you see after you picked a new one and doesn't apply that new path to the mod shortcuts. Will get it fixed when possible.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107641" date="Posted: Wed Aug 10, 2005 6:58 pm "><author>Gazado</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">The mod seemed ok , there is a lot of new custom content in there which is great.
<br /><br />I found the game to chug worse than any other mod or expansion Ive used with Doom 3 - there are only two things I can think of that would cause this:
<br /><br />1) Poorly optimised mapping - little use of visportals and/or poorly structured geometry. Without looking at the maps in the editor I wont know.
<br /><br />2) Doom 3 doesnt seem to like loading too much data up from a mod folder. The more custom resources you use, the more slower the game seems to run. In the case of this project, it is a complete total conversion and this might be why the game goes so slowly compared to other mods etc...
<br /><br />Generally speaking it seems ok to play through but for me it is isnt that far of a step forward from the original. Someone also stated that there were a lot more lights because its more lighter than standard Doom 3 levels. I tend to disagree with this, the maps in this project seem just as dark as in Doom 3 - I fail to see where extra lights would be used over what is in use by Doom 3.
<br /><br />Another thing that made me laugh, the light guards knees seem to be glued together like he is desperate for a pee.
<br /><br />I may have missed some setting somewhere, but I failed to find an option to enable a crosshair. That in itself was incredibly frustrating. If there is an option for a crosshair, please post here how to get it.
<br /><br />Not bad, not bad at all, but not overly amazing either. Will be interested to see where the rest of the project goes though as it has the potential to be extremly interesting and fun to play.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107644" date="Posted: Wed Aug 10, 2005 7:14 pm "><author>AO</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Cool, I'm downloading the mod now!

(I'm not sugarcoating anything btw )
<br /><br />I was running this with:
<br />Barton 2800+
<br />GF 6600gt 128
<br />Asus Nforce2
<br />1024 mb ram
<br />And I played it at hard.
<br /><br />Bugs:
<br />* The installer installed all the files directly in my Doom3 root. (in this case e:\spel\Doom 3) instead of the directory that it created for the mod.
<br />* The icon created didn't lead to the actual mod/game (as previously stated)
<br />* No crosshair option. (If I had known what the consol command for it was, I had probably had been having more fun. Checking your aim by watching where the bullets land have a certain charm in itself though. :p)
<br />* Am I just tired, or was there no auto run?
<br />* When the "barrels" explode they leave a debries, that seconds later instantly disappears. Why not just blow it all up at once?
<br />* It's running quite slow. I get dips to 40fps all the time.
<br />* The game bogs down to 1-5 fps in the last map's final areas (where you open the drainwell) and I can't for the life of me figure out why. 
<br />* Add a music volume lever in the System settings menu.
<br />* When it starts I hear "Computer updated" I hit F1 but noting happens. I hit tab but nothing happens. I look in the controls setup and find nothing. So what computer is updated?
<br />* In the first map, when you jumped out of the little crawl space down into the water, you can't get back. (I wanna go get that andrenalin pack in the beginning, since I didn't need it before but do now when I meet heavy opposition from a gun turret and flying ships and stuff)
<br />* These screenshots display how I found the models to need some more work.
<br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225040221/http://www.darch-angel.com/temporary/q2lm01.jpg" class="postlink">Shot1 - arm</a> | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225040221/http://www.darch-angel.com/temporary/q2lm02.jpg" class="postlink">Shot2 - Rear pelvis</a> | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225040221/http://www.darch-angel.com/temporary/q2lm03.jpg" class="postlink">Shot3 - Flying corpses</a> | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225040221/http://www.darch-angel.com/temporary/q2lm04.jpg" class="postlink">Shot4 - Remnant Light</a>
<br /><br />Design-flaws: (This of course is a matter of opinion more than anything)
<br />* The textures show that they are not the least 3d. Generally they look ok, but many of them really shows how they are drawn in Photoshop/PSP/whatever and the bumpmapping of them really gives off a sense of "Nvidia normalmap filter" usage. And in some cases it doesn't look like they even have any bumpmap.
<br />* The light guards go down way to hard. IMO they should go down on one shotgun blast. instead I need to use two, and since I didn't have any crosshair, even then they wouldn't always go down. (even if I shot them in the head at point blank range, sure they got a visor. But still they're the weakest enemy in the whole game.).
<br />* The music drove me nuts. It was too repetetive and too boring. After hearing the same short piece in the last map over and over again I was ready to scream. (I'd like to note that I actually love the Quake2 soundtrack, and still after all these years listen to it.)
<br />* It's way too dark. It's even darker than Doom3. And I only have the blaster to light my way. Quake2 is not this dark. 
<br />* In the last map there's an andrenaline pack on a floating crate, Why can't I jump up on that crate and grab it? Am I Stephen Hawkins?
<br />* Why did you make the first map MORE linear than the original?
<br />* Atleast replace the skin of the grenade for this version. It's way out of place now.
<br />* <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225040221/http://www.darch-angel.com/temporary/q2lm05.jpg" class="postlink">Water level after draining.</a>
<br />* The orange light guards skins are too slick and clean. They don't match well with the surroundings.
<br />* Sometimes I mistook the machinegun for the shotgun. Might just have been because I was unfamiliar with them.
<br />* I think you should work more on making the new monsters look like actual discusting cyborgs. Right now they don't give me much of that feeling, just regular soldiers. With guns for hands. (in other words, work on the skins some more, make them a bit more menacing)
<br />* The water was quite nice, but the shader effect on it (heathaze I assume) is running way to fast. It's too active to be just lying there in puddles. Now it's moving around like it was a stream or it was raining on it.
<br /><br />That's all I can think of for now. I'll be back later to complain some more. :p</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107659" date="Posted: Wed Aug 10, 2005 9:24 pm "><author>Kiltron</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks for the feedback Kristus.

Job well done.
<br /><br />However the gameplay needs some work: the NPC's movement is like that of an elderly person. There's areas where I got physically stuck; couldn't climb up on crates etc... And crosshair would be nice (unless you have to enable in in the .cfg file, haven't looked into it yet). 
<br /><br />Overall though, exellent test build.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107677" date="Posted: Wed Aug 10, 2005 11:06 pm "><author>heXum</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Just played through it.
<br /><br />The map design, lighting, texturing... all look pretty damn good. I had a few people watching me and everyone was real impressed by the first scene.
<br /><br />A few things that really stood out that hopefully will get some attention:
<br /><br />-Crosshair. This is necessary.
<br /><br />-Strogg don't speak english. The "INTRUDER ALERT" message blaring would be cooler if it sounded like an alien message or just an alarm. It would also be cool if you could change the GUI's to read in an alien language and have some sort of graphical representation for what they do.
<br /><br />-The animations, which you said needed some work, need some serious work. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225040221im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> They glide when they walk and the soldiers look like they have to pee, which someone mentioned above.
<br /><br />-Not nearly enough health/weapons/ammo in obvious places. I played on Normal and it felt waaay too hard. I couldn't find nearly enough health in the first level and it took me a few tries on the 2nd level before I realized that you were hiding half of the pick-ups under the water. Considering I somehow missed the shotgun in the first level (I took the secret way and missed it) I was using the blaster for the majority of the game. This was pretty frustrating.
<br /><br />-A message and sound for pick-ups would be really great.
<br /><br />-A little more thought on the scripting part of the level design would be good. There were a few times where the soldiers were hiding behind boxes and they didn't come out until I ran around so they could see me. It would be cool if I hit a trigger that made them run out and attack. when I got close. Little things like that.
<br /><br />-I couldn't figure out how to get past the end of level 1 when you are left trying to get past the laser beams and you have the ship shooting at you through the window. I eventually had to noclip past to win. I don't know what I was doing wrong here.
<br /><br />Over all, it looked great but the game play was sort of a let down for the reasons stated above. Keep it up, it'll get there!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p108206" date="Posted: Mon Aug 15, 2005 2:39 am "><author>Kiltron</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Has anyone ever disobeyed a direct order? <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225040337im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p108212" date="Posted: Mon Aug 15, 2005 4:07 am "><author>kat</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Kiltron wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Has anyone ever disobeyed a direct order? <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225040337im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /></div>Not on *this* forum they don't  ( <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225040337im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /> ), we sling them in the stockade without a second thought if they do that.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p108213" date="Posted: Mon Aug 15, 2005 4:38 am "><author>Kiltron</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Heh........was just tossing out an Easter Egg hint.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p108223" date="Posted: Mon Aug 15, 2005 5:48 am "><author>kat</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Oh heh, well at least you knew what I ment *cough*  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225040337im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p108230" date="Posted: Mon Aug 15, 2005 6:46 am "><author>Infernis</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I still have high hopes to, I'm just pointing out that there are some serious slow down issues that shouldn't occur on a machine like mine.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p108280" date="Posted: Mon Aug 15, 2005 3:34 pm "><author>SonicClang</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Kiltron, you just made that way too obvious...  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225040337im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8)" title="Cool" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p108303" date="Posted: Mon Aug 15, 2005 5:44 pm "><author>Kiltron</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">SonicClang wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Kiltron, you just made that way too obvious...  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225040337im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8)" title="Cool" /></div>

<br /><br />The enforcers glide like ice skaters. Very graceful!
<br /><br />Enemies with too much health. Hard to kill off what should be cannonfodder.
<br /><br />Dropships that shoot at me! The game is already tough enough on Normal!
<br /><br />Not enough health.
<br /><br />Saving and loading don't work on the Main Menu.
<br /><br />The chaingun guys are weird-looking. I liked them when they were comically short and stalky. I called them George, after George Castanza from Seinfeld.
<br /><br />Sound effects aren't very high-quality. Try shooting for Doom 3 sound quality as much as you can.
<br /><br />Needs better voice acting. Couldn't stop laughing at the "Intruder Alert" sound. Everyone kinda slurs as they make noise.
<br /><br />No crosshair. I can't aim by myself worth a damn. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225040337im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><br /><br />On to the good comments.
<br /><br />Map design is excellent. My specs are P4 2.8 Ghz, GeForce 6600gt, and 1.5GB RAM. I noticed a bit of chopiness, but I don't see that as bad. Clearly, you're looking towards the future of gaming by pushing this engine's limits. Half of the responsibility goes into the mapper's optimization techniques while the other half is for the gamers to keep their PCs upgraded for the games they want.
<br /><br />Weapons look nice. (Shotgun could have slightly faster rate-of-fire, though)
<br /><br />Some music was good.
<br /><br />Keep up the good work, Kiltron and Crew.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p108489" date="Posted: Tue Aug 16, 2005 4:24 pm "><author>Kiltron</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I appreciate all the feedback from everyone.

<br /><br />It's finally here. The highly anticipated release of the Quake II: Lost Marine QuakeCon 2005 Test Build for DOOM 3. Get your guns and gear ready for this action packed remix of Quake II within the DOOM 3 engine. Engage in high combat situations in all new areas with all new gameplay. Fight various Strogg enemies along your way including Enforcers, Light Guards and Flyers. Take them out with your Blaster, Double Barrel Shotgun, or other aresenal that you come across. Find secrets and secret areas and powerups. Unlock secret extra content, and much more!
<br /><br />This is a Single Player Demo only. This is not the full or final polished release of the mod. This is only a test build, for progress showing and bug feedback reporting. There are still things we need to finish, including animations, code, art etc. It's packaged in a Windows Installer and is also ready for burning a backup copy of the mod to CD. Don't forget to grab your CD Labels on the Downloads page as well.
<br /><br />It's been a tough 4 months developing this demo, but I promised to have something playable by QuakeCon 2005 and I delivered on that promise. Everyone did an excellent job. So without further delay, go download the mod and kick some Strogg ass!

<br /><br />After the first loading screen it took me a few seconds to realize it wasn't Quake 2, which is a good thing.
<br /><br />It's a little sluggish on my rig but I'm more to blame for that than you. I realize that you're using more lights than the stock Doom 3 maps in order to make the levels in the mod well lit so it's a given that performance won't be quite as good.
<br /><br />The only real gripe I have is the installer, as you aren't prompted for the location of Doom 3. It just assumes that you've installed Doom 3 in C:\Program Files\Doom 3\ which means you have to move the mod and change the shortcut.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107592" date="Posted: Wed Aug 10, 2005 8:54 am "><author>psyborg</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">been playing it quite for a good while now. heres my critique

<br /><br />enemies: they all look good but the light enforcer needs more animation alot of the time he seems to be gliding around, and have him aim his gun higher looks like hes pointing it downward. flyer and enforcer are great.

(Though I followed their directions to a T, there's checkboxes they say to use missing from my application so I was at a loss on what to do)
<br /><br />You can choose any path you want to install to, and the mod will install to it, it just doesn't update the path you see after you picked a new one and doesn't apply that new path to the mod shortcuts.

<br /><br />I found the game to chug worse than any other mod or expansion Ive used with Doom 3 - there are only two things I can think of that would cause this:
<br /><br />1) Poorly optimised mapping - little use of visportals and/or poorly structured geometry. Without looking at the maps in the editor I wont know.
<br /><br />2) Doom 3 doesnt seem to like loading too much data up from a mod folder. The more custom resources you use, the more slower the game seems to run. In the case of this project, it is a complete total conversion and this might be why the game goes so slowly compared to other mods etc...
<br /><br />Generally speaking it seems ok to play through but for me it is isnt that far of a step forward from the original. Someone also stated that there were a lot more lights because its more lighter than standard Doom 3 levels. I tend to disagree with this, the maps in this project seem just as dark as in Doom 3 - I fail to see where extra lights would be used over what is in use by Doom 3.
<br /><br />Another thing that made me laugh, the light guards knees seem to be glued together like he is desperate for a pee.
<br /><br />I may have missed some setting somewhere, but I failed to find an option to enable a crosshair. That in itself was incredibly frustrating. If there is an option for a crosshair, please post here how to get it.
<br /><br />Not bad, not bad at all, but not overly amazing either. Will be interested to see where the rest of the project goes though as it has the potential to be extremly interesting and fun to play.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107644" date="Posted: Wed Aug 10, 2005 7:14 pm "><author>AO</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Cool, I'm downloading the mod now!

(I'm not sugarcoating anything btw )
<br /><br />I was running this with:
<br />Barton 2800+
<br />GF 6600gt 128
<br />Asus Nforce2
<br />1024 mb ram
<br />And I played it at hard.
<br /><br />Bugs:
<br />* The installer installed all the files directly in my Doom3 root. (in this case e:\spel\Doom 3) instead of the directory that it created for the mod.
<br />* The icon created didn't lead to the actual mod/game (as previously stated)
<br />* No crosshair option. (If I had known what the consol command for it was, I had probably had been having more fun. Checking your aim by watching where the bullets land have a certain charm in itself though. :p)
<br />* Am I just tired, or was there no auto run?
<br />* When the "barrels" explode they leave a debries, that seconds later instantly disappears. Why not just blow it all up at once?
<br />* It's running quite slow. I get dips to 40fps all the time.
<br />* The game bogs down to 1-5 fps in the last map's final areas (where you open the drainwell) and I can't for the life of me figure out why. 
<br />* Add a music volume lever in the System settings menu.
<br />* When it starts I hear "Computer updated" I hit F1 but noting happens. I hit tab but nothing happens. I look in the controls setup and find nothing. So what computer is updated?
<br />* In the first map, when you jumped out of the little crawl space down into the water, you can't get back. (I wanna go get that andrenalin pack in the beginning, since I didn't need it before but do now when I meet heavy opposition from a gun turret and flying ships and stuff)
<br />* These screenshots display how I found the models to need some more work.
<br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225044656/http://www.darch-angel.com/temporary/q2lm01.jpg" class="postlink">Shot1 - arm</a> | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225044656/http://www.darch-angel.com/temporary/q2lm02.jpg" class="postlink">Shot2 - Rear pelvis</a> | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225044656/http://www.darch-angel.com/temporary/q2lm03.jpg" class="postlink">Shot3 - Flying corpses</a> | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225044656/http://www.darch-angel.com/temporary/q2lm04.jpg" class="postlink">Shot4 - Remnant Light</a>
<br /><br />Design-flaws: (This of course is a matter of opinion more than anything)
<br />* The textures show that they are not the least 3d. Generally they look ok, but many of them really shows how they are drawn in Photoshop/PSP/whatever and the bumpmapping of them really gives off a sense of "Nvidia normalmap filter" usage. And in some cases it doesn't look like they even have any bumpmap.
<br />* The light guards go down way to hard. IMO they should go down on one shotgun blast. instead I need to use two, and since I didn't have any crosshair, even then they wouldn't always go down. (even if I shot them in the head at point blank range, sure they got a visor. But still they're the weakest enemy in the whole game.).
<br />* The music drove me nuts. It was too repetetive and too boring. After hearing the same short piece in the last map over and over again I was ready to scream. (I'd like to note that I actually love the Quake2 soundtrack, and still after all these years listen to it.)
<br />* It's way too dark. It's even darker than Doom3. And I only have the blaster to light my way. Quake2 is not this dark. 
<br />* In the last map there's an andrenaline pack on a floating crate, Why can't I jump up on that crate and grab it? Am I Stephen Hawkins?
<br />* Why did you make the first map MORE linear than the original?
<br />* Atleast replace the skin of the grenade for this version. It's way out of place now.
<br />* <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225044656/http://www.darch-angel.com/temporary/q2lm05.jpg" class="postlink">Water level after draining.</a>
<br />* The orange light guards skins are too slick and clean. They don't match well with the surroundings.
<br />* Sometimes I mistook the machinegun for the shotgun. Might just have been because I was unfamiliar with them.
<br />* I think you should work more on making the new monsters look like actual discusting cyborgs. Right now they don't give me much of that feeling, just regular soldiers. With guns for hands. (in other words, work on the skins some more, make them a bit more menacing)
<br />* The water was quite nice, but the shader effect on it (heathaze I assume) is running way to fast. It's too active to be just lying there in puddles. Now it's moving around like it was a stream or it was raining on it.
<br /><br />That's all I can think of for now. I'll be back later to complain some more. :p</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107659" date="Posted: Wed Aug 10, 2005 9:24 pm "><author>Kiltron</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks for the feedback Kristus.

<br /><br />However the gameplay needs some work: the NPC's movement is like that of an elderly person. There's areas where I got physically stuck; couldn't climb up on crates etc... And crosshair would be nice (unless you have to enable in in the .cfg file, haven't looked into it yet).

<br /><br />-Crosshair. This is necessary.
<br /><br />-Strogg don't speak english. The "INTRUDER ALERT" message blaring would be cooler if it sounded like an alien message or just an alarm. It would also be cool if you could change the GUI's to read in an alien language and have some sort of graphical representation for what they do.
<br /><br />-The animations, which you said needed some work, need some serious work. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225044656im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> They glide when they walk and the soldiers look like they have to pee, which someone mentioned above.
<br /><br />-Not nearly enough health/weapons/ammo in obvious places. I played on Normal and it felt waaay too hard. I couldn't find nearly enough health in the first level and it took me a few tries on the 2nd level before I realized that you were hiding half of the pick-ups under the water. Considering I somehow missed the shotgun in the first level (I took the secret way and missed it) I was using the blaster for the majority of the game. This was pretty frustrating.
<br /><br />-A message and sound for pick-ups would be really great.
<br /><br />-A little more thought on the scripting part of the level design would be good. There were a few times where the soldiers were hiding behind boxes and they didn't come out until I ran around so they could see me. It would be cool if I hit a trigger that made them run out and attack. when I got close. Little things like that.
<br /><br />-I couldn't figure out how to get past the end of level 1 when you are left trying to get past the laser beams and you have the ship shooting at you through the window. I eventually had to noclip past to win. I don't know what I was doing wrong here.
<br /><br />Over all, it looked great but the game play was sort of a let down for the reasons stated above. Keep it up, it'll get there!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107684" date="Posted: Wed Aug 10, 2005 11:27 pm "><author>Quanta</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Just played it. My thoughts:
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Bad Stuff</span></span>
<br />- Way, way, WAY too hard IMO. I lost close to 40 health trying to get out of the starting area and into the rest of the base. I cowardly turned on God mode just so I could live to see the rest of the demo. (yes, I know, shame on me <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225043144im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> )
<br />- Health doesn't do much. I mean, +2 Health, +10 Health? The light shotgunners and machine gunners will take that out with their first shots. Health should really do more, especially given the amount of enemies that one must fight and how much damage they can inflict in a short time period. I can tell already that Gunners are gonna eat thru 100 health like it's nothing, and that's not even with grenades.
<br />- The Fliers seem compelled to get up-close, which I find strange because it makes them an easy target since one shotgun blast kills them. They should probably hang back more and dodge more frequently, since their blasters are more of a menace than anything else.
<br />- A crosshair is definately needed in order to fire true. I wasn't sure what I was hitting, if anything.
<br />- Most of the Light Guards went down smoothly, but sometimes they could take a direct shotgun blast to the head without going down. You may need to adjust their health slightly. Or add the crosshair, as aim may have been off slightly in some cases.
<br />- The marine is missing from the opening sequence. Seriously, I did not see him at all.
<br />- At the end of Outer Base, at the exit elevator, I fired Blaster shots into the elevator to see better. There was nothing in there. I went to open the doors, and when they slid open there was an Enforcer inside, which made absolutely no sense. Consider making the door solid instead, removing the Enforcer, or having the elevator sit in a lowered state by default, so when it comes up, the doors open and the Enforcer steps out to attack.
<br />- It's too dark, though I guess this is mostly the engine's fault. The exit elevator, however, should've had SOME light cast upon it, since it was pitch black. There were other areas like this as well, especially in Installation.
<br />- The Fliers seem to be in a state of perpetual darkness. Maybe it was just the locations I was fighting them, but it seemed to me as if they were under permanent shadow.
<br />- The AI needs work. The enemies seemed capable of shooting forever, which makes life extraordinarily difficult. Even the Z-Sec and Zombie Commandoes need time to reload, and they have the power of Hell on their side.
<br />- For the short time that I was taking damage, my plight didn't seem noticeable. I lost 40 points of health in the first 2 minutes and not so much as a grunt was heard from me. There was also nothing to indicate that I was taking damage at all, I just found myself with less health all of a sudden. The effects of taking damage should be more obvious, and I should make some noise when getting hit.
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Good Stuff</span></span>
<br />- Water. The water was cool. My only gripe is that you sink too fast and floating is difficult to accomplish. You should sink slowly, but not too slowly since you have an arsenal of weapons and armor to carry around.
<br />- The weapons look spiffy. I think the firing animation for the Blaster could use improvement though.
<br />- The bodies integrated into the base near the end of Installation were a nice, creepy touch.
<br />- I liked shattering the glass in a lot of places. It was nice to have some destructible elements at hand.
<br /><br />There's not a whole lot more that I can think of, but those are the things I think need work.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107686" date="Posted: Wed Aug 10, 2005 11:44 pm "><author>Kristus</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">heXum wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">-Strogg don't speak english.

<br /><br />Yes, I reacted on this too at first. But then I remembered that all (many atleast) the signs in Quake 2 was in fact in english. So I am quite perplexed on that matter. None of the stroggs actually speak any english. They got their cool Stroggish. But the signs in Q2 read in english, probably because you had to know where the warehouse actually were.

(I'm not counting consol and menu fonts etc) and that's the "Stroggo language" and english. Unfortunately they are very scarce as back in the days of q2, they only mostly 128x128 sized textures, and that let them get away with little red lines portraying as text. :p
<br /><br />But I got screenshots of the two examples. They're not much, but it might be enough to fill your needs.
<br />This is the best example I could find of the Stroggo fontstyle. This one is not that important to get right, since unlike Cyan, id didn't actually invent an entire language. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225043144im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225043144/http://www.darch-angel.com/temporary/stroggofnt.jpg">http://www.darch-angel.com/temporary/stroggofnt.jpg</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />And here's the english font, notice how some of the letters are flipped backwards though.

<br />THis one reminds me of a font called: Mael and another I can't remember what it's called, but it's the one used in this image: &lt;br&gt;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225043144/http://www.doomworld.com/unholy/island/images/logo.png" class="postlink">Link to an image with a fontstyle in it.</a>
<br /><br />While the other reminds me of one called "Gothic 107" and another called "Ekster 1.00", aswell as "MindFields 1.0" (this one is even hard/impossible to read).
<br /><br />I'm not saying that these fonts are any dead ringers or anything.

I love this site and the helpful people that post here.  I have been visiting D3W since June '04 and have never posted anything.  Since Q2 is my favorite FPS, I figured my first post should be here.
<br /><br />Anyways, the mod is awesome but the textures really bugged me.  They look like they were taken straight from the Q2 retexturing site.  This wouldn't be a bad thing if they were made with a PPL engine in mind, but they weren't.  The diffuse stages all have shadows painted on them.  What's worse is that they were then run through a Normal Map filter, resulting in normal maps that are not that good.  
<br /><br />From my experince, normal maps look best if you make true bump maps first (or an actual 3d model) and then run that through the filter (preferably in many different stages and then flattened together).
<br /><br />Also, the normal maps should just be the major forms of the texture, ie bricks, panels, planks, etc..  Then use bumpmaps to create the actual imperfections  like weathering, rust, grain, etc.
<br /><br />Hope this helps out, and keep working because I cannot wait to play the full version.

<br /><br />I tested the mod (nice one) &amp; found that the game crashes each time I try to change the video quality. So I'm stuck in a "low" quality (any resolution seems to work), but I can't try "medium" or "high"...

<br /><br />EDIT: I forget to mention that the game crashes only during level loading (I tested both levels...), i.e. if I switch the game quality, everything goes fine (the game restarts,etc...), but if I try to play a level, then the game begins to load ressources &amp; crashes at that point:

<br /><br />Those right there are definite factors in your performance. Through my testings, SP2 hurts FPS when running DOOM 3. (could differ on other machines however, but it affected it on my dev box)
<br /><br />The TI 4600 isn't a recommended card for D3 itself, though it does run it. I pushed the bar with the engine and mod by using many 2048's so anything less than a GF6800 and 512RAM isn't suggested. I targeted high end systems. GF6800-7800 1024-2048RAM. The mod itself doesn't run poorly, it just requires steeper hardware specs.
<br /><br />Crylar, updgrade D3 to the 1.3 Patch.

<br /><br />The first time I could install the mod but it wouldn't load due to the fact I hadn't updated to 1.3 yet.
<br /><br />I had a system crash a while back and Doom was on a different partition. I could still play the game so I didn't bother with reinstalling. But it wouldn't let me update to 1.3 because the game wasn't properly installed.
<br /><br />So I reinstalled Doom and ROE and I updated to 1.3. Now the installer won't run at all, sometimes it does appear in the processes window of Windows Task Manager but nothing happens. Most of the time it just does nothing at all and sometimes I get a loading screen with blocks filling up and that's the end of it.
<br /><br />I tried running the install from the zip archive. Extracting the zip archive to a default directory, tried to extract it to a different directory but nothing changes.

When the action is being pumped backwards the hand pulls the forearm away from the gun, resulting in a small, but noticeable, error.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225042122/http://img292.imageshack.us/my.php?image=shot000038lv.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225042122im_/http://img292.imageshack.us/img292/2669/shot000038lv.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />As for the alignment issues, it may be a matter of preference to particular players, I can't speak for anyone else, but in my opinion the shotgun feels most "right" in terms of how it is aligned, I have the easiest time aiming with it without a crosshair. In opposition to this the supershotgun draws a line farther to the left and considerably lower than the shotgun. I have spliced a picture of the shotgun and supershotgun together to demonstrate this.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225042122/http://img362.imageshack.us/my.php?image=splice6la.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225042122im_/http://img362.imageshack.us/img362/5333/splice6la.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />The machine gun has the same issue as the supershotgun, perhaps its not so much poor alignment as inconsistency which is making this so noticeable to me. If I weren't lazy I'd post pictures of the DooM 3 weapons.

Kiltron's site doesn't have a forum for discussing problems.
<br /><br />I'm really anxious to play this, but it is just soooooooo choppy, I can't do anything. There are parts where it runs ok, like underneath in the crawl space in the first level. But anytime there's anything special on screen it runs at less than 1 fps. By the time I "wake up" from the choppyness I'm either dead or nearly dead from enemies. Anytime there's an enemy on the screen especially it's just crawling! 
<br /><br />I'm very intersted to know if anyone else is having the same problem. Doom 3 runs smooth as silk on my computer. Every game I run does. I even set the specs as low as I could get them and it still just crawled along. I couldn't get past the first level.

The Wrong .dll API issue is that problem. Trying to run 1.3 gamecode with a 1.2 installation won't work.
<br /><br />The slowdowns people are getting from characters on screen is because this test release is aimed to test pushing characters using 2048x2048 texture maps down the pipe. That's why I say using a GeForce 6800 or equivalent or higher is recommended. That is D3's recommended card, and we're pushing just a little bit further using those texture sizes. This isn't on all surfaces, just the characters.

Or maybe I'm just stupid but when you start in the first map, you can take two routes. Crawling beneath the rock to get to the broken elevator room or shoot the window and crawl down to end up in the water room. 
<br /><br />I did the last but after you jumped in the water there is no way of returning. This wouldn't be a problem but the door leading back to the beginning is locked [the one with the turret operation panel next to it]. Since I wasn't able to deactive the red lasers I figured I must have missed something, but after some searching it appeared the only way of getting back to the beginning was using "Noclip" to get through the door.
<br /><br />I didn't find anything special so how do you put the red lasers of ? I eventually used God mode to get through and I hate cheating.
<br /><br />Also the site mentions that the mod wouldn't be a clone, but this sure as hell looks and plays a lot like Quake 2 to me.

<br /><br /><br />To turn off the lasers, when you reach the "water room" swim as far to the right as you can, go underwater, look around for a bit. There will be a room with lasers and a path around them to a control panel where you can turn off the lasers.
<br /><br />There's an easter egg in the room as well.

<br /><br />The enforcers glide like ice skaters. Very graceful!
<br /><br />Enemies with too much health. Hard to kill off what should be cannonfodder.
<br /><br />Dropships that shoot at me! The game is already tough enough on Normal!
<br /><br />Not enough health.
<br /><br />Saving and loading don't work on the Main Menu.
<br /><br />The chaingun guys are weird-looking. I liked them when they were comically short and stalky. I called them George, after George Castanza from Seinfeld.
<br /><br />Sound effects aren't very high-quality. Try shooting for Doom 3 sound quality as much as you can.
<br /><br />Needs better voice acting. Couldn't stop laughing at the "Intruder Alert" sound. Everyone kinda slurs as they make noise.
<br /><br />No crosshair. I can't aim by myself worth a damn. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225040658im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><br /><br />On to the good comments.
<br /><br />Map design is excellent. My specs are P4 2.8 Ghz, GeForce 6600gt, and 1.5GB RAM. I noticed a bit of chopiness, but I don't see that as bad. Clearly, you're looking towards the future of gaming by pushing this engine's limits. Half of the responsibility goes into the mapper's optimization techniques while the other half is for the gamers to keep their PCs upgraded for the games they want.
<br /><br />Weapons look nice. (Shotgun could have slightly faster rate-of-fire, though)
<br /><br />Some music was good.
<br /><br />Keep up the good work, Kiltron and Crew.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p108489" date="Posted: Tue Aug 16, 2005 4:24 pm "><author>Kiltron</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I appreciate all the feedback from everyone.

<br /><br />It's finally here. The highly anticipated release of the Quake II: Lost Marine QuakeCon 2005 Test Build for DOOM 3. Get your guns and gear ready for this action packed remix of Quake II within the DOOM 3 engine. Engage in high combat situations in all new areas with all new gameplay. Fight various Strogg enemies along your way including Enforcers, Light Guards and Flyers. Take them out with your Blaster, Double Barrel Shotgun, or other aresenal that you come across. Find secrets and secret areas and powerups. Unlock secret extra content, and much more!
<br /><br />This is a Single Player Demo only. This is not the full or final polished release of the mod. This is only a test build, for progress showing and bug feedback reporting. There are still things we need to finish, including animations, code, art etc. It's packaged in a Windows Installer and is also ready for burning a backup copy of the mod to CD. Don't forget to grab your CD Labels on the Downloads page as well.
<br /><br />It's been a tough 4 months developing this demo, but I promised to have something playable by QuakeCon 2005 and I delivered on that promise. Everyone did an excellent job. So without further delay, go download the mod and kick some Strogg ass!

<br /><br />It's a little sluggish on my rig but I'm more to blame for that than you. I realize that you're using more lights than the stock Doom 3 maps in order to make the levels in the mod well lit so it's a given that performance won't be quite as good.
<br /><br />The only real gripe I have is the installer, as you aren't prompted for the location of Doom 3.

<br /><br />You can choose any path you want to install to, and the mod will install to it, it just doesn't update the path you see after you picked a new one and doesn't apply that new path to the mod shortcuts.

<br /><br />I found the game to chug worse than any other mod or expansion Ive used with Doom 3 - there are only two things I can think of that would cause this:
<br /><br />1) Poorly optimised mapping - little use of visportals and/or poorly structured geometry. Without looking at the maps in the editor I wont know.
<br /><br />2) Doom 3 doesnt seem to like loading too much data up from a mod folder. The more custom resources you use, the more slower the game seems to run. In the case of this project, it is a complete total conversion and this might be why the game goes so slowly compared to other mods etc...
<br /><br />Generally speaking it seems ok to play through but for me it is isnt that far of a step forward from the original. Someone also stated that there were a lot more lights because its more lighter than standard Doom 3 levels. I tend to disagree with this, the maps in this project seem just as dark as in Doom 3 - I fail to see where extra lights would be used over what is in use by Doom 3.
<br /><br />Another thing that made me laugh, the light guards knees seem to be glued together like he is desperate for a pee.
<br /><br />I may have missed some setting somewhere, but I failed to find an option to enable a crosshair. That in itself was incredibly frustrating. If there is an option for a crosshair, please post here how to get it.
<br /><br />Not bad, not bad at all, but not overly amazing either.

(I'm not sugarcoating anything btw )
<br /><br />I was running this with:
<br />Barton 2800+
<br />GF 6600gt 128
<br />Asus Nforce2
<br />1024 mb ram
<br />And I played it at hard.
<br /><br />Bugs:
<br />* The installer installed all the files directly in my Doom3 root. (in this case e:\spel\Doom 3) instead of the directory that it created for the mod.
<br />* The icon created didn't lead to the actual mod/game (as previously stated)
<br />* No crosshair option. (If I had known what the consol command for it was, I had probably had been having more fun. Checking your aim by watching where the bullets land have a certain charm in itself though. :p)
<br />* Am I just tired, or was there no auto run?
<br />* When the "barrels" explode they leave a debries, that seconds later instantly disappears. Why not just blow it all up at once?
<br />* It's running quite slow. I get dips to 40fps all the time.
<br />* The game bogs down to 1-5 fps in the last map's final areas (where you open the drainwell) and I can't for the life of me figure out why. 
<br />* Add a music volume lever in the System settings menu.
<br />* When it starts I hear "Computer updated" I hit F1 but noting happens. I hit tab but nothing happens. I look in the controls setup and find nothing. So what computer is updated?
<br />* In the first map, when you jumped out of the little crawl space down into the water, you can't get back. (I wanna go get that andrenalin pack in the beginning, since I didn't need it before but do now when I meet heavy opposition from a gun turret and flying ships and stuff)
<br />* These screenshots display how I found the models to need some more work.
<br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.darch-angel.com/temporary/q2lm01.jpg" class="postlink">Shot1 - arm</a> | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.darch-angel.com/temporary/q2lm02.jpg" class="postlink">Shot2 - Rear pelvis</a> | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.darch-angel.com/temporary/q2lm03.jpg" class="postlink">Shot3 - Flying corpses</a> | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.darch-angel.com/temporary/q2lm04.jpg" class="postlink">Shot4 - Remnant Light</a>
<br /><br />Design-flaws: (This of course is a matter of opinion more than anything)
<br />* The textures show that they are not the least 3d. Generally they look ok, but many of them really shows how they are drawn in Photoshop/PSP/whatever and the bumpmapping of them really gives off a sense of "Nvidia normalmap filter" usage. And in some cases it doesn't look like they even have any bumpmap.
<br />* The light guards go down way to hard. IMO they should go down on one shotgun blast. instead I need to use two, and since I didn't have any crosshair, even then they wouldn't always go down. (even if I shot them in the head at point blank range, sure they got a visor. But still they're the weakest enemy in the whole game.).
<br />* The music drove me nuts. It was too repetetive and too boring. After hearing the same short piece in the last map over and over again I was ready to scream. (I'd like to note that I actually love the Quake2 soundtrack, and still after all these years listen to it.)
<br />* It's way too dark. It's even darker than Doom3. And I only have the blaster to light my way. Quake2 is not this dark. 
<br />* In the last map there's an andrenaline pack on a floating crate, Why can't I jump up on that crate and grab it? Am I Stephen Hawkins?
<br />* Why did you make the first map MORE linear than the original?
<br />* Atleast replace the skin of the grenade for this version. It's way out of place now.
<br />* <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.darch-angel.com/temporary/q2lm05.jpg" class="postlink">Water level after draining.</a>
<br />* The orange light guards skins are too slick and clean. They don't match well with the surroundings.
<br />* Sometimes I mistook the machinegun for the shotgun. Might just have been because I was unfamiliar with them.
<br />* I think you should work more on making the new monsters look like actual discusting cyborgs. Right now they don't give me much of that feeling, just regular soldiers. With guns for hands. (in other words, work on the skins some more, make them a bit more menacing)
<br />* The water was quite nice, but the shader effect on it (heathaze I assume) is running way to fast. It's too active to be just lying there in puddles. Now it's moving around like it was a stream or it was raining on it.
<br /><br />That's all I can think of for now. I'll be back later to complain some more. :p</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107659" date="Posted: Wed Aug 10, 2005 8:24 pm "><author>Kiltron</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks for the feedback Kristus.

<br /><br />It's finally here. The highly anticipated release of the Quake II: Lost Marine QuakeCon 2005 Test Build for DOOM 3. Get your guns and gear ready for this action packed remix of Quake II within the DOOM 3 engine. Engage in high combat situations in all new areas with all new gameplay.

Find secrets and secret areas and powerups. Unlock secret extra content, and much more!
<br /><br />This is a Single Player Demo only. This is not the full or final polished release of the mod. This is only a test build, for progress showing and bug feedback reporting. There are still things we need to finish, including animations, code, art etc. It's packaged in a Windows Installer and is also ready for burning a backup copy of the mod to CD. Don't forget to grab your CD Labels on the Downloads page as well.
<br /><br />It's been a tough 4 months developing this demo, but I promised to have something playable by QuakeCon 2005 and I delivered on that promise. Everyone did an excellent job. So without further delay, go download the mod and kick some Strogg ass!

<br /><br />After the first loading screen it took me a few seconds to realize it wasn't Quake 2, which is a good thing.
<br /><br />It's a little sluggish on my rig but I'm more to blame for that than you. I realize that you're using more lights than the stock Doom 3 maps in order to make the levels in the mod well lit so it's a given that performance won't be quite as good.
<br /><br />The only real gripe I have is the installer, as you aren't prompted for the location of Doom 3.

<br /><br />enemies: they all look good but the light enforcer needs more animation alot of the time he seems to be gliding around, and have him aim his gun higher looks like hes pointing it downward. flyer and enforcer are great.

(Though I followed their directions to a T, there's checkboxes they say to use missing from my application so I was at a loss on what to do)
<br /><br />You can choose any path you want to install to, and the mod will install to it, it just doesn't update the path you see after you picked a new one and doesn't apply that new path to the mod shortcuts. Will get it fixed when possible.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107641" date="Posted: Wed Aug 10, 2005 5:58 pm "><author>Gazado</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">The mod seemed ok , there is a lot of new custom content in there which is great.
<br /><br />I found the game to chug worse than any other mod or expansion Ive used with Doom 3 - there are only two things I can think of that would cause this:
<br /><br />1) Poorly optimised mapping - little use of visportals and/or poorly structured geometry. Without looking at the maps in the editor I wont know.
<br /><br />2) Doom 3 doesnt seem to like loading too much data up from a mod folder. The more custom resources you use, the more slower the game seems to run. In the case of this project, it is a complete total conversion and this might be why the game goes so slowly compared to other mods etc...
<br /><br />Generally speaking it seems ok to play through but for me it is isnt that far of a step forward from the original. Someone also stated that there were a lot more lights because its more lighter than standard Doom 3 levels. I tend to disagree with this, the maps in this project seem just as dark as in Doom 3 - I fail to see where extra lights would be used over what is in use by Doom 3.
<br /><br />Another thing that made me laugh, the light guards knees seem to be glued together like he is desperate for a pee.
<br /><br />I may have missed some setting somewhere, but I failed to find an option to enable a crosshair. That in itself was incredibly frustrating. If there is an option for a crosshair, please post here how to get it.
<br /><br />Not bad, not bad at all, but not overly amazing either. Will be interested to see where the rest of the project goes though as it has the potential to be extremly interesting and fun to play.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107644" date="Posted: Wed Aug 10, 2005 6:14 pm "><author>AO</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Cool, I'm downloading the mod now!

<br /><br />I found the game to chug worse than any other mod or expansion Ive used with Doom 3 - there are only two things I can think of that would cause this:
<br /><br />1) Poorly optimised mapping - little use of visportals and/or poorly structured geometry. Without looking at the maps in the editor I wont know.
<br /><br />2) Doom 3 doesnt seem to like loading too much data up from a mod folder. The more custom resources you use, the more slower the game seems to run. In the case of this project, it is a complete total conversion and this might be why the game goes so slowly compared to other mods etc...
<br /><br />Generally speaking it seems ok to play through but for me it is isnt that far of a step forward from the original. Someone also stated that there were a lot more lights because its more lighter than standard Doom 3 levels. I tend to disagree with this, the maps in this project seem just as dark as in Doom 3 - I fail to see where extra lights would be used over what is in use by Doom 3.
<br /><br />Another thing that made me laugh, the light guards knees seem to be glued together like he is desperate for a pee.
<br /><br />I may have missed some setting somewhere, but I failed to find an option to enable a crosshair. That in itself was incredibly frustrating. If there is an option for a crosshair, please post here how to get it.
<br /><br />Not bad, not bad at all, but not overly amazing either.

(I'm not sugarcoating anything btw )
<br /><br />I was running this with:
<br />Barton 2800+
<br />GF 6600gt 128
<br />Asus Nforce2
<br />1024 mb ram
<br />And I played it at hard.
<br /><br />Bugs:
<br />* The installer installed all the files directly in my Doom3 root. (in this case e:\spel\Doom 3) instead of the directory that it created for the mod.
<br />* The icon created didn't lead to the actual mod/game (as previously stated)
<br />* No crosshair option. (If I had known what the consol command for it was, I had probably had been having more fun. Checking your aim by watching where the bullets land have a certain charm in itself though. :p)
<br />* Am I just tired, or was there no auto run?
<br />* When the "barrels" explode they leave a debries, that seconds later instantly disappears. Why not just blow it all up at once?
<br />* It's running quite slow. I get dips to 40fps all the time.
<br />* The game bogs down to 1-5 fps in the last map's final areas (where you open the drainwell) and I can't for the life of me figure out why. 
<br />* Add a music volume lever in the System settings menu.
<br />* When it starts I hear "Computer updated" I hit F1 but noting happens. I hit tab but nothing happens. I look in the controls setup and find nothing. So what computer is updated?
<br />* In the first map, when you jumped out of the little crawl space down into the water, you can't get back. (I wanna go get that andrenalin pack in the beginning, since I didn't need it before but do now when I meet heavy opposition from a gun turret and flying ships and stuff)
<br />* These screenshots display how I found the models to need some more work.

<br /><br />Design-flaws: (This of course is a matter of opinion more than anything)
<br />* The textures show that they are not the least 3d. Generally they look ok, but many of them really shows how they are drawn in Photoshop/PSP/whatever and the bumpmapping of them really gives off a sense of "Nvidia normalmap filter" usage. And in some cases it doesn't look like they even have any bumpmap.
<br />* The light guards go down way to hard. IMO they should go down on one shotgun blast. instead I need to use two, and since I didn't have any crosshair, even then they wouldn't always go down. (even if I shot them in the head at point blank range, sure they got a visor. But still they're the weakest enemy in the whole game.).
<br />* The music drove me nuts. It was too repetetive and too boring. After hearing the same short piece in the last map over and over again I was ready to scream. (I'd like to note that I actually love the Quake2 soundtrack, and still after all these years listen to it.)
<br />* It's way too dark. It's even darker than Doom3. And I only have the blaster to light my way. Quake2 is not this dark. 
<br />* In the last map there's an andrenaline pack on a floating crate, Why can't I jump up on that crate and grab it? Am I Stephen Hawkins?
<br />* Why did you make the first map MORE linear than the original?
<br />* Atleast replace the skin of the grenade for this version. It's way out of place now.
<br />* <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.darch-angel.com/temporary/q2lm05.jpg" class="postlink">Water level after draining.</a>
<br />* The orange light guards skins are too slick and clean. They don't match well with the surroundings.
<br />* Sometimes I mistook the machinegun for the shotgun. Might just have been because I was unfamiliar with them.
<br />* I think you should work more on making the new monsters look like actual discusting cyborgs. Right now they don't give me much of that feeling, just regular soldiers. With guns for hands. (in other words, work on the skins some more, make them a bit more menacing)
<br />* The water was quite nice, but the shader effect on it (heathaze I assume) is running way to fast. It's too active to be just lying there in puddles. Now it's moving around like it was a stream or it was raining on it.
<br /><br />That's all I can think of for now. I'll be back later to complain some more. :p</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107659" date="Posted: Wed Aug 10, 2005 8:24 pm "><author>Kiltron</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks for the feedback Kristus.

<br /><br />It's finally here. The highly anticipated release of the Quake II: Lost Marine QuakeCon 2005 Test Build for DOOM 3. Get your guns and gear ready for this action packed remix of Quake II within the DOOM 3 engine. Engage in high combat situations in all new areas with all new gameplay. Fight various Strogg enemies along your way including Enforcers, Light Guards and Flyers. Take them out with your Blaster, Double Barrel Shotgun, or other aresenal that you come across. Find secrets and secret areas and powerups. Unlock secret extra content, and much more!
<br /><br />This is a Single Player Demo only. This is not the full or final polished release of the mod. This is only a test build, for progress showing and bug feedback reporting. There are still things we need to finish, including animations, code, art etc. It's packaged in a Windows Installer and is also ready for burning a backup copy of the mod to CD. Don't forget to grab your CD Labels on the Downloads page as well.
<br /><br />It's been a tough 4 months developing this demo, but I promised to have something playable by QuakeCon 2005 and I delivered on that promise. Everyone did an excellent job. So without further delay, go download the mod and kick some Strogg ass!

<br /><br />After the first loading screen it took me a few seconds to realize it wasn't Quake 2, which is a good thing.
<br /><br />It's a little sluggish on my rig but I'm more to blame for that than you. I realize that you're using more lights than the stock Doom 3 maps in order to make the levels in the mod well lit so it's a given that performance won't be quite as good.
<br /><br />The only real gripe I have is the installer, as you aren't prompted for the location of Doom 3. It just assumes that you've installed Doom 3 in C:\Program Files\Doom 3\ which means you have to move the mod and change the shortcut.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107592" date="Posted: Wed Aug 10, 2005 7:54 am "><author>psyborg</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">been playing it quite for a good while now. heres my critique
<br /><br />mapping: brilliant, although a little chuggy in some spots i had to turn video settings to medium.
<br /><br />weapons: very good, love them.
<br /><br />enemies: they all look good but the light enforcer needs more animation alot of the time he seems to be gliding around, and have him aim his gun higher looks like hes pointing it downward. flyer and enforcer are great. 
<br /><br />items: they look good but i dont like the way they light up, looks weird.

<br /><br />It's finally here. The highly anticipated release of the Quake II: Lost Marine QuakeCon 2005 Test Build for DOOM 3. Get your guns and gear ready for this action packed remix of Quake II within the DOOM 3 engine. Engage in high combat situations in all new areas with all new gameplay. Fight various Strogg enemies along your way including Enforcers, Light Guards and Flyers. Take them out with your Blaster, Double Barrel Shotgun, or other aresenal that you come across. Find secrets and secret areas and powerups. Unlock secret extra content, and much more!
<br /><br />This is a Single Player Demo only. This is not the full or final polished release of the mod. This is only a test build, for progress showing and bug feedback reporting. There are still things we need to finish, including animations, code, art etc. It's packaged in a Windows Installer and is also ready for burning a backup copy of the mod to CD. Don't forget to grab your CD Labels on the Downloads page as well.
<br /><br />It's been a tough 4 months developing this demo, but I promised to have something playable by QuakeCon 2005 and I delivered on that promise. Everyone did an excellent job. So without further delay, go download the mod and kick some Strogg ass!

<br /><br />The only real gripe I have is the installer, as you aren't prompted for the location of Doom 3.

<br /><br />I found the game to chug worse than any other mod or expansion Ive used with Doom 3 - there are only two things I can think of that would cause this:
<br /><br />1) Poorly optimised mapping - little use of visportals and/or poorly structured geometry. Without looking at the maps in the editor I wont know.
<br /><br />2) Doom 3 doesnt seem to like loading too much data up from a mod folder. The more custom resources you use, the more slower the game seems to run. In the case of this project, it is a complete total conversion and this might be why the game goes so slowly compared to other mods etc...
<br /><br />Generally speaking it seems ok to play through but for me it is isnt that far of a step forward from the original. Someone also stated that there were a lot more lights because its more lighter than standard Doom 3 levels. I tend to disagree with this, the maps in this project seem just as dark as in Doom 3 - I fail to see where extra lights would be used over what is in use by Doom 3.
<br /><br />Another thing that made me laugh, the light guards knees seem to be glued together like he is desperate for a pee.
<br /><br />I may have missed some setting somewhere, but I failed to find an option to enable a crosshair. That in itself was incredibly frustrating. If there is an option for a crosshair, please post here how to get it.
<br /><br />Not bad, not bad at all, but not overly amazing either.

(I'm not sugarcoating anything btw )
<br /><br />I was running this with:
<br />Barton 2800+
<br />GF 6600gt 128
<br />Asus Nforce2
<br />1024 mb ram
<br />And I played it at hard.
<br /><br />Bugs:
<br />* The installer installed all the files directly in my Doom3 root. (in this case e:\spel\Doom 3) instead of the directory that it created for the mod.
<br />* The icon created didn't lead to the actual mod/game (as previously stated)
<br />* No crosshair option. (If I had known what the consol command for it was, I had probably had been having more fun. Checking your aim by watching where the bullets land have a certain charm in itself though. :p)
<br />* Am I just tired, or was there no auto run?
<br />* When the "barrels" explode they leave a debries, that seconds later instantly disappears. Why not just blow it all up at once?
<br />* It's running quite slow. I get dips to 40fps all the time.
<br />* The game bogs down to 1-5 fps in the last map's final areas (where you open the drainwell) and I can't for the life of me figure out why. 
<br />* Add a music volume lever in the System settings menu.
<br />* When it starts I hear "Computer updated" I hit F1 but noting happens. I hit tab but nothing happens. I look in the controls setup and find nothing. So what computer is updated?
<br />* In the first map, when you jumped out of the little crawl space down into the water, you can't get back. (I wanna go get that andrenalin pack in the beginning, since I didn't need it before but do now when I meet heavy opposition from a gun turret and flying ships and stuff)
<br />* These screenshots display how I found the models to need some more work.
<br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.darch-angel.com/temporary/q2lm01.jpg" class="postlink">Shot1 - arm</a> | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.darch-angel.com/temporary/q2lm02.jpg" class="postlink">Shot2 - Rear pelvis</a> | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.darch-angel.com/temporary/q2lm03.jpg" class="postlink">Shot3 - Flying corpses</a> | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.darch-angel.com/temporary/q2lm04.jpg" class="postlink">Shot4 - Remnant Light</a>
<br /><br />Design-flaws: (This of course is a matter of opinion more than anything)
<br />* The textures show that they are not the least 3d. Generally they look ok, but many of them really shows how they are drawn in Photoshop/PSP/whatever and the bumpmapping of them really gives off a sense of "Nvidia normalmap filter" usage. And in some cases it doesn't look like they even have any bumpmap.
<br />* The light guards go down way to hard. IMO they should go down on one shotgun blast. instead I need to use two, and since I didn't have any crosshair, even then they wouldn't always go down. (even if I shot them in the head at point blank range, sure they got a visor. But still they're the weakest enemy in the whole game.).
<br />* The music drove me nuts. It was too repetetive and too boring. After hearing the same short piece in the last map over and over again I was ready to scream. (I'd like to note that I actually love the Quake2 soundtrack, and still after all these years listen to it.)
<br />* It's way too dark. It's even darker than Doom3. And I only have the blaster to light my way. Quake2 is not this dark. 
<br />* In the last map there's an andrenaline pack on a floating crate, Why can't I jump up on that crate and grab it? Am I Stephen Hawkins?
<br />* Why did you make the first map MORE linear than the original?
<br />* Atleast replace the skin of the grenade for this version. It's way out of place now.
<br />* <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.darch-angel.com/temporary/q2lm05.jpg" class="postlink">Water level after draining.</a>
<br />* The orange light guards skins are too slick and clean. They don't match well with the surroundings.
<br />* Sometimes I mistook the machinegun for the shotgun. Might just have been because I was unfamiliar with them.
<br />* I think you should work more on making the new monsters look like actual discusting cyborgs. Right now they don't give me much of that feeling, just regular soldiers. With guns for hands. (in other words, work on the skins some more, make them a bit more menacing)
<br />* The water was quite nice, but the shader effect on it (heathaze I assume) is running way to fast. It's too active to be just lying there in puddles. Now it's moving around like it was a stream or it was raining on it.
<br /><br />That's all I can think of for now. I'll be back later to complain some more. :p</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107659" date="Posted: Wed Aug 10, 2005 8:24 pm "><author>Kiltron</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks for the feedback Kristus.

<br />* The installer installed all the files directly in my Doom3 root. (in this case e:\spel\Doom 3) instead of the directory that it created for the mod.
<br />* The icon created didn't lead to the actual mod/game (as previously stated)
<br />* No crosshair option. (If I had known what the consol command for it was, I had probably had been having more fun. Checking your aim by watching where the bullets land have a certain charm in itself though. :p)
<br />* Am I just tired, or was there no auto run?
<br />* When the "barrels" explode they leave a debries, that seconds later instantly disappears. Why not just blow it all up at once?
<br />* It's running quite slow. I get dips to 40fps all the time.
<br />* The game bogs down to 1-5 fps in the last map's final areas (where you open the drainwell) and I can't for the life of me figure out why. 
<br />* Add a music volume lever in the System settings menu.
<br />* When it starts I hear "Computer updated" I hit F1 but noting happens. I hit tab but nothing happens. I look in the controls setup and find nothing. So what computer is updated?
<br />* In the first map, when you jumped out of the little crawl space down into the water, you can't get back. (I wanna go get that andrenalin pack in the beginning, since I didn't need it before but do now when I meet heavy opposition from a gun turret and flying ships and stuff)
<br />* These screenshots display how I found the models to need some more work.

<br /><br />Design-flaws: (This of course is a matter of opinion more than anything)
<br />* The textures show that they are not the least 3d. Generally they look ok, but many of them really shows how they are drawn in Photoshop/PSP/whatever and the bumpmapping of them really gives off a sense of "Nvidia normalmap filter" usage. And in some cases it doesn't look like they even have any bumpmap.
<br />* The light guards go down way to hard. IMO they should go down on one shotgun blast. instead I need to use two, and since I didn't have any crosshair, even then they wouldn't always go down. (even if I shot them in the head at point blank range, sure they got a visor. But still they're the weakest enemy in the whole game.).
<br />* The music drove me nuts. It was too repetetive and too boring. After hearing the same short piece in the last map over and over again I was ready to scream. (I'd like to note that I actually love the Quake2 soundtrack, and still after all these years listen to it.)
<br />* It's way too dark. It's even darker than Doom3. And I only have the blaster to light my way. Quake2 is not this dark. 
<br />* In the last map there's an andrenaline pack on a floating crate, Why can't I jump up on that crate and grab it? Am I Stephen Hawkins?
<br />* Why did you make the first map MORE linear than the original?
<br />* Atleast replace the skin of the grenade for this version. It's way out of place now.
<br />* <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.darch-angel.com/temporary/q2lm05.jpg" class="postlink">Water level after draining.</a>
<br />* The orange light guards skins are too slick and clean. They don't match well with the surroundings.
<br />* Sometimes I mistook the machinegun for the shotgun. Might just have been because I was unfamiliar with them.
<br />* I think you should work more on making the new monsters look like actual discusting cyborgs. Right now they don't give me much of that feeling, just regular soldiers. With guns for hands. (in other words, work on the skins some more, make them a bit more menacing)
<br />* The water was quite nice, but the shader effect on it (heathaze I assume) is running way to fast. It's too active to be just lying there in puddles. Now it's moving around like it was a stream or it was raining on it.
<br /><br />That's all I can think of for now. I'll be back later to complain some more. :p</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107659" date="Posted: Wed Aug 10, 2005 8:24 pm "><author>Kiltron</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks for the feedback Kristus.

<br /><br />After the first loading screen it took me a few seconds to realize it wasn't Quake 2, which is a good thing.
<br /><br />It's a little sluggish on my rig but I'm more to blame for that than you. I realize that you're using more lights than the stock Doom 3 maps in order to make the levels in the mod well lit so it's a given that performance won't be quite as good.
<br /><br />The only real gripe I have is the installer, as you aren't prompted for the location of Doom 3. It just assumes that you've installed Doom 3 in C:\Program Files\Doom 3\ which means you have to move the mod and change the shortcut.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107592" date="Posted: Wed Aug 10, 2005 7:54 am "><author>psyborg</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">been playing it quite for a good while now. heres my critique
<br /><br />mapping: brilliant, although a little chuggy in some spots i had to turn video settings to medium.
<br /><br />weapons: very good, love them.
<br /><br />enemies: they all look good but the light enforcer needs more animation alot of the time he seems to be gliding around, and have him aim his gun higher looks like hes pointing it downward. flyer and enforcer are great. 
<br /><br />items: they look good but i dont like the way they light up, looks weird.
<br /><br />presentation/installer/gui: very professional
<br /><br />music: awesome
<br /><br />for a test build its very fun and really cool but needs a little more work, cant wait for the finished product.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107593" date="Posted: Wed Aug 10, 2005 7:55 am "><author>doomkid3000</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Im Very Impressed <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil" /><br />how do you turn crosshairs on</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107596" date="Posted: Wed Aug 10, 2005 8:46 am "><author>Petter</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">downloading!!!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107597" date="Posted: Wed Aug 10, 2005 8:50 am "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Guess that qualifies for news - congrats!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107599" date="Posted: Wed Aug 10, 2005 9:11 am "><author>Petter</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I get bumped out on my desktop when tryign to execute the exe file, it also happens if i try to open it in the mods in doom3.

(Though I followed their directions to a T, there's checkboxes they say to use missing from my application so I was at a loss on what to do)
<br /><br />You can choose any path you want to install to, and the mod will install to it, it just doesn't update the path you see after you picked a new one and doesn't apply that new path to the mod shortcuts. Will get it fixed when possible.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107641" date="Posted: Wed Aug 10, 2005 5:58 pm "><author>Gazado</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">The mod seemed ok , there is a lot of new custom content in there which is great.
<br /><br />I found the game to chug worse than any other mod or expansion Ive used with Doom 3 - there are only two things I can think of that would cause this:
<br /><br />1) Poorly optimised mapping - little use of visportals and/or poorly structured geometry. Without looking at the maps in the editor I wont know.
<br /><br />2) Doom 3 doesnt seem to like loading too much data up from a mod folder. The more custom resources you use, the more slower the game seems to run. In the case of this project, it is a complete total conversion and this might be why the game goes so slowly compared to other mods etc...
<br /><br />Generally speaking it seems ok to play through but for me it is isnt that far of a step forward from the original. Someone also stated that there were a lot more lights because its more lighter than standard Doom 3 levels. I tend to disagree with this, the maps in this project seem just as dark as in Doom 3 - I fail to see where extra lights would be used over what is in use by Doom 3.
<br /><br />Another thing that made me laugh, the light guards knees seem to be glued together like he is desperate for a pee.
<br /><br />I may have missed some setting somewhere, but I failed to find an option to enable a crosshair. That in itself was incredibly frustrating. If there is an option for a crosshair, please post here how to get it.
<br /><br />Not bad, not bad at all, but not overly amazing either. Will be interested to see where the rest of the project goes though as it has the potential to be extremly interesting and fun to play.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107644" date="Posted: Wed Aug 10, 2005 6:14 pm "><author>AO</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Cool, I'm downloading the mod now!

(I'm not sugarcoating anything btw )&#13;<br /><br />I was running this with:&#13;<br />Barton 2800+&#13;<br />GF 6600gt 128&#13;<br />Asus Nforce2&#13;<br />1024 mb ram&#13;<br />And I played it at hard.&#13;<br /><br />Bugs:&#13;<br />* The installer installed all the files directly in my Doom3 root. (in this case e:\spel\Doom 3) instead of the directory that it created for the mod.&#13;<br />* The icon created didn't lead to the actual mod/game (as previously stated)&#13;<br />* No crosshair option. (If I had known what the consol command for it was, I had probably had been having more fun. Checking your aim by watching where the bullets land have a certain charm in itself though. :p)&#13;<br />* Am I just tired, or was there no auto run?&#13;<br />* When the "barrels" explode they leave a debries, that seconds later instantly disappears. Why not just blow it all up at once?&#13;<br />* It's running quite slow. I get dips to 40fps all the time.&#13;<br />* The game bogs down to 1-5 fps in the last map's final areas (where you open the drainwell) and I can't for the life of me figure out why. &#13;<br />* Add a music volume lever in the System settings menu.&#13;<br />* When it starts I hear "Computer updated" I hit F1 but noting happens. I hit tab but nothing happens. I look in the controls setup and find nothing. So what computer is updated?&#13;<br />* In the first map, when you jumped out of the little crawl space down into the water, you can't get back. (I wanna go get that andrenalin pack in the beginning, since I didn't need it before but do now when I meet heavy opposition from a gun turret and flying ships and stuff)&#13;<br />* These screenshots display how I found the models to need some more work.&#13;<br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.darch-angel.com/temporary/q2lm01.jpg" class="postlink">Shot1 - arm</a> | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.darch-angel.com/temporary/q2lm02.jpg" class="postlink">Shot2 - Rear pelvis</a> | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.darch-angel.com/temporary/q2lm03.jpg" class="postlink">Shot3 - Flying corpses</a> | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.darch-angel.com/temporary/q2lm04.jpg" class="postlink">Shot4 - Remnant Light</a>&#13;<br /><br />Design-flaws: (This of course is a matter of opinion more than anything)&#13;<br />* The textures show that they are not the least 3d. Generally they look ok, but many of them really shows how they are drawn in Photoshop/PSP/whatever and the bumpmapping of them really gives off a sense of "Nvidia normalmap filter" usage. And in some cases it doesn't look like they even have any bumpmap.&#13;<br />* The light guards go down way to hard. IMO they should go down on one shotgun blast. instead I need to use two, and since I didn't have any crosshair, even then they wouldn't always go down. (even if I shot them in the head at point blank range, sure they got a visor. But still they're the weakest enemy in the whole game.).&#13;<br />* The music drove me nuts. It was too repetetive and too boring. After hearing the same short piece in the last map over and over again I was ready to scream. (I'd like to note that I actually love the Quake2 soundtrack, and still after all these years listen to it.)&#13;<br />* It's way too dark. It's even darker than Doom3. And I only have the blaster to light my way. Quake2 is not this dark. &#13;<br />* In the last map there's an andrenaline pack on a floating crate, Why can't I jump up on that crate and grab it? Am I Stephen Hawkins?&#13;<br />* Why did you make the first map MORE linear than the original?&#13;<br />* Atleast replace the skin of the grenade for this version. It's way out of place now.&#13;<br />* <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.darch-angel.com/temporary/q2lm05.jpg" class="postlink">Water level after draining.</a>&#13;<br />* The orange light guards skins are too slick and clean. They don't match well with the surroundings.&#13;<br />* Sometimes I mistook the machinegun for the shotgun. Might just have been because I was unfamiliar with them.&#13;<br />* I think you should work more on making the new monsters look like actual discusting cyborgs. Right now they don't give me much of that feeling, just regular soldiers. With guns for hands. (in other words, work on the skins some more, make them a bit more menacing)&#13;<br />* The water was quite nice, but the shader effect on it (heathaze I assume) is running way to fast. It's too active to be just lying there in puddles. Now it's moving around like it was a stream or it was raining on it.&#13;<br /><br />That's all I can think of for now. I'll be back later to complain some more. :p</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107659" date="Posted: Wed Aug 10, 2005 8:24 pm "><author>Kiltron</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks for the feedback Kristus.&#13;<br /><br />It would be more helpful if you included suggestions with the complaints as to how you feel would improve them. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />Work In Progress as stated on the main menu.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107662" date="Posted: Wed Aug 10, 2005 8:34 pm "><author>Kristus</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I'd like to change one of the comments.

<br /><br />Design-flaws: (This of course is a matter of opinion more than anything)
<br />* The textures show that they are not the least 3d. Generally they look ok, but many of them really shows how they are drawn in Photoshop/PSP/whatever and the bumpmapping of them really gives off a sense of "Nvidia normalmap filter" usage. And in some cases it doesn't look like they even have any bumpmap.
<br />* The light guards go down way to hard. IMO they should go down on one shotgun blast. instead I need to use two, and since I didn't have any crosshair, even then they wouldn't always go down. (even if I shot them in the head at point blank range, sure they got a visor. But still they're the weakest enemy in the whole game.).
<br />* The music drove me nuts. It was too repetetive and too boring. After hearing the same short piece in the last map over and over again I was ready to scream. (I'd like to note that I actually love the Quake2 soundtrack, and still after all these years listen to it.)
<br />* It's way too dark. It's even darker than Doom3. And I only have the blaster to light my way. Quake2 is not this dark. 
<br />* In the last map there's an andrenaline pack on a floating crate, Why can't I jump up on that crate and grab it? Am I Stephen Hawkins?
<br />* Why did you make the first map MORE linear than the original?
<br />* Atleast replace the skin of the grenade for this version. It's way out of place now.
<br />* <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.darch-angel.com/temporary/q2lm05.jpg" class="postlink">Water level after draining.</a>
<br />* The orange light guards skins are too slick and clean. They don't match well with the surroundings.
<br />* Sometimes I mistook the machinegun for the shotgun. Might just have been because I was unfamiliar with them.
<br />* I think you should work more on making the new monsters look like actual discusting cyborgs. Right now they don't give me much of that feeling, just regular soldiers. With guns for hands. (in other words, work on the skins some more, make them a bit more menacing)
<br />* The water was quite nice, but the shader effect on it (heathaze I assume) is running way to fast. It's too active to be just lying there in puddles. Now it's moving around like it was a stream or it was raining on it.
<br /><br />That's all I can think of for now. I'll be back later to complain some more. :p</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107659" date="Posted: Wed Aug 10, 2005 8:24 pm "><author>Kiltron</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks for the feedback Kristus.

<br /><br />The only real gripe I have is the installer, as you aren't prompted for the location of Doom 3.

(Though I followed their directions to a T, there's checkboxes they say to use missing from my application so I was at a loss on what to do)
<br /><br />You can choose any path you want to install to, and the mod will install to it, it just doesn't update the path you see after you picked a new one and doesn't apply that new path to the mod shortcuts. Will get it fixed when possible.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107641" date="Posted: Wed Aug 10, 2005 5:58 pm "><author>Gazado</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">The mod seemed ok , there is a lot of new custom content in there which is great.
<br /><br />I found the game to chug worse than any other mod or expansion Ive used with Doom 3 - there are only two things I can think of that would cause this:
<br /><br />1) Poorly optimised mapping - little use of visportals and/or poorly structured geometry. Without looking at the maps in the editor I wont know.
<br /><br />2) Doom 3 doesnt seem to like loading too much data up from a mod folder. The more custom resources you use, the more slower the game seems to run. In the case of this project, it is a complete total conversion and this might be why the game goes so slowly compared to other mods etc...
<br /><br />Generally speaking it seems ok to play through but for me it is isnt that far of a step forward from the original. Someone also stated that there were a lot more lights because its more lighter than standard Doom 3 levels. I tend to disagree with this, the maps in this project seem just as dark as in Doom 3 - I fail to see where extra lights would be used over what is in use by Doom 3.
<br /><br />Another thing that made me laugh, the light guards knees seem to be glued together like he is desperate for a pee.
<br /><br />I may have missed some setting somewhere, but I failed to find an option to enable a crosshair. That in itself was incredibly frustrating. If there is an option for a crosshair, please post here how to get it.
<br /><br />Not bad, not bad at all, but not overly amazing either. Will be interested to see where the rest of the project goes though as it has the potential to be extremly interesting and fun to play.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107644" date="Posted: Wed Aug 10, 2005 6:14 pm "><author>AO</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Cool, I'm downloading the mod now!

(I'm not sugarcoating anything btw )
<br /><br />I was running this with:
<br />Barton 2800+
<br />GF 6600gt 128
<br />Asus Nforce2
<br />1024 mb ram
<br />And I played it at hard.
<br /><br />Bugs:
<br />* The installer installed all the files directly in my Doom3 root. (in this case e:\spel\Doom 3) instead of the directory that it created for the mod.
<br />* The icon created didn't lead to the actual mod/game (as previously stated)
<br />* No crosshair option. (If I had known what the consol command for it was, I had probably had been having more fun. Checking your aim by watching where the bullets land have a certain charm in itself though. :p)
<br />* Am I just tired, or was there no auto run?
<br />* When the "barrels" explode they leave a debries, that seconds later instantly disappears. Why not just blow it all up at once?
<br />* It's running quite slow. I get dips to 40fps all the time.
<br />* The game bogs down to 1-5 fps in the last map's final areas (where you open the drainwell) and I can't for the life of me figure out why. 
<br />* Add a music volume lever in the System settings menu.
<br />* When it starts I hear "Computer updated" I hit F1 but noting happens. I hit tab but nothing happens. I look in the controls setup and find nothing. So what computer is updated?
<br />* In the first map, when you jumped out of the little crawl space down into the water, you can't get back. (I wanna go get that andrenalin pack in the beginning, since I didn't need it before but do now when I meet heavy opposition from a gun turret and flying ships and stuff)
<br />* These screenshots display how I found the models to need some more work.

<br /><br />You can choose any path you want to install to, and the mod will install to it, it just doesn't update the path you see after you picked a new one and doesn't apply that new path to the mod shortcuts.

<br /><br />I found the game to chug worse than any other mod or expansion Ive used with Doom 3 - there are only two things I can think of that would cause this:
<br /><br />1) Poorly optimised mapping - little use of visportals and/or poorly structured geometry. Without looking at the maps in the editor I wont know.
<br /><br />2) Doom 3 doesnt seem to like loading too much data up from a mod folder. The more custom resources you use, the more slower the game seems to run. In the case of this project, it is a complete total conversion and this might be why the game goes so slowly compared to other mods etc...
<br /><br />Generally speaking it seems ok to play through but for me it is isnt that far of a step forward from the original. Someone also stated that there were a lot more lights because its more lighter than standard Doom 3 levels. I tend to disagree with this, the maps in this project seem just as dark as in Doom 3 - I fail to see where extra lights would be used over what is in use by Doom 3.
<br /><br />Another thing that made me laugh, the light guards knees seem to be glued together like he is desperate for a pee.
<br /><br />I may have missed some setting somewhere, but I failed to find an option to enable a crosshair. That in itself was incredibly frustrating. If there is an option for a crosshair, please post here how to get it.
<br /><br />Not bad, not bad at all, but not overly amazing either. Will be interested to see where the rest of the project goes though as it has the potential to be extremly interesting and fun to play.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107644" date="Posted: Wed Aug 10, 2005 6:14 pm "><author>AO</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Cool, I'm downloading the mod now!

(I'm not sugarcoating anything btw )
<br /><br />I was running this with:
<br />Barton 2800+
<br />GF 6600gt 128
<br />Asus Nforce2
<br />1024 mb ram
<br />And I played it at hard.
<br /><br />Bugs:
<br />* The installer installed all the files directly in my Doom3 root. (in this case e:\spel\Doom 3) instead of the directory that it created for the mod.
<br />* The icon created didn't lead to the actual mod/game (as previously stated)
<br />* No crosshair option. (If I had known what the consol command for it was, I had probably had been having more fun. Checking your aim by watching where the bullets land have a certain charm in itself though. :p)
<br />* Am I just tired, or was there no auto run?
<br />* When the "barrels" explode they leave a debries, that seconds later instantly disappears. Why not just blow it all up at once?
<br />* It's running quite slow. I get dips to 40fps all the time.
<br />* The game bogs down to 1-5 fps in the last map's final areas (where you open the drainwell) and I can't for the life of me figure out why. 
<br />* Add a music volume lever in the System settings menu.
<br />* When it starts I hear "Computer updated" I hit F1 but noting happens. I hit tab but nothing happens. I look in the controls setup and find nothing. So what computer is updated?
<br />* In the first map, when you jumped out of the little crawl space down into the water, you can't get back. (I wanna go get that andrenalin pack in the beginning, since I didn't need it before but do now when I meet heavy opposition from a gun turret and flying ships and stuff)
<br />* These screenshots display how I found the models to need some more work.

<br /><br />Design-flaws: (This of course is a matter of opinion more than anything)
<br />* The textures show that they are not the least 3d. Generally they look ok, but many of them really shows how they are drawn in Photoshop/PSP/whatever and the bumpmapping of them really gives off a sense of "Nvidia normalmap filter" usage. And in some cases it doesn't look like they even have any bumpmap.
<br />* The light guards go down way to hard. IMO they should go down on one shotgun blast. instead I need to use two, and since I didn't have any crosshair, even then they wouldn't always go down. (even if I shot them in the head at point blank range, sure they got a visor. But still they're the weakest enemy in the whole game.).
<br />* The music drove me nuts. It was too repetetive and too boring. After hearing the same short piece in the last map over and over again I was ready to scream. (I'd like to note that I actually love the Quake2 soundtrack, and still after all these years listen to it.)
<br />* It's way too dark. It's even darker than Doom3. And I only have the blaster to light my way. Quake2 is not this dark. 
<br />* In the last map there's an andrenaline pack on a floating crate, Why can't I jump up on that crate and grab it? Am I Stephen Hawkins?
<br />* Why did you make the first map MORE linear than the original?
<br />* Atleast replace the skin of the grenade for this version. It's way out of place now.
<br />* <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.darch-angel.com/temporary/q2lm05.jpg" class="postlink">Water level after draining.</a>
<br />* The orange light guards skins are too slick and clean. They don't match well with the surroundings.
<br />* Sometimes I mistook the machinegun for the shotgun. Might just have been because I was unfamiliar with them.
<br />* I think you should work more on making the new monsters look like actual discusting cyborgs. Right now they don't give me much of that feeling, just regular soldiers. With guns for hands. (in other words, work on the skins some more, make them a bit more menacing)
<br />* The water was quite nice, but the shader effect on it (heathaze I assume) is running way to fast. It's too active to be just lying there in puddles. Now it's moving around like it was a stream or it was raining on it.
<br /><br />That's all I can think of for now. I'll be back later to complain some more. :p</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107659" date="Posted: Wed Aug 10, 2005 8:24 pm "><author>Kiltron</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks for the feedback Kristus.

<br /><br />It's finally here. The highly anticipated release of the Quake II: Lost Marine QuakeCon 2005 Test Build for DOOM 3. Get your guns and gear ready for this action packed remix of Quake II within the DOOM 3 engine. Engage in high combat situations in all new areas with all new gameplay.

Find secrets and secret areas and powerups. Unlock secret extra content, and much more!
<br /><br />This is a Single Player Demo only. This is not the full or final polished release of the mod. This is only a test build, for progress showing and bug feedback reporting. There are still things we need to finish, including animations, code, art etc. It's packaged in a Windows Installer and is also ready for burning a backup copy of the mod to CD. Don't forget to grab your CD Labels on the Downloads page as well.
<br /><br />It's been a tough 4 months developing this demo, but I promised to have something playable by QuakeCon 2005 and I delivered on that promise. Everyone did an excellent job. So without further delay, go download the mod and kick some Strogg ass!

<br /><br />After the first loading screen it took me a few seconds to realize it wasn't Quake 2, which is a good thing.
<br /><br />It's a little sluggish on my rig but I'm more to blame for that than you. I realize that you're using more lights than the stock Doom 3 maps in order to make the levels in the mod well lit so it's a given that performance won't be quite as good.
<br /><br />The only real gripe I have is the installer, as you aren't prompted for the location of Doom 3. It just assumes that you've installed Doom 3 in C:\Program Files\Doom 3\ which means you have to move the mod and change the shortcut.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107592" date="Posted: Wed Aug 10, 2005 7:54 am "><author>psyborg</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">been playing it quite for a good while now. heres my critique
<br /><br />mapping: brilliant, although a little chuggy in some spots i had to turn video settings to medium.
<br /><br />weapons: very good, love them.
<br /><br />enemies: they all look good but the light enforcer needs more animation alot of the time he seems to be gliding around, and have him aim his gun higher looks like hes pointing it downward. flyer and enforcer are great. 
<br /><br />items: they look good but i dont like the way they light up, looks weird.
<br /><br />presentation/installer/gui: very professional
<br /><br />music: awesome
<br /><br />for a test build its very fun and really cool but needs a little more work, cant wait for the finished product.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107593" date="Posted: Wed Aug 10, 2005 7:55 am "><author>doomkid3000</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Im Very Impressed <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil" /><br />how do you turn crosshairs on</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107596" date="Posted: Wed Aug 10, 2005 8:46 am "><author>Petter</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">downloading!!!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107597" date="Posted: Wed Aug 10, 2005 8:50 am "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Guess that qualifies for news - congrats!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107599" date="Posted: Wed Aug 10, 2005 9:11 am "><author>Petter</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I get bumped out on my desktop when tryign to execute the exe file, it also happens if i try to open it in the mods in doom3.

<br /><br />It's a little sluggish on my rig but I'm more to blame for that than you. I realize that you're using more lights than the stock Doom 3 maps in order to make the levels in the mod well lit so it's a given that performance won't be quite as good.
<br /><br />The only real gripe I have is the installer, as you aren't prompted for the location of Doom 3.

<br /><br />I found the game to chug worse than any other mod or expansion Ive used with Doom 3 - there are only two things I can think of that would cause this:
<br /><br />1) Poorly optimised mapping - little use of visportals and/or poorly structured geometry. Without looking at the maps in the editor I wont know.
<br /><br />2) Doom 3 doesnt seem to like loading too much data up from a mod folder. The more custom resources you use, the more slower the game seems to run. In the case of this project, it is a complete total conversion and this might be why the game goes so slowly compared to other mods etc...
<br /><br />Generally speaking it seems ok to play through but for me it is isnt that far of a step forward from the original. Someone also stated that there were a lot more lights because its more lighter than standard Doom 3 levels. I tend to disagree with this, the maps in this project seem just as dark as in Doom 3 - I fail to see where extra lights would be used over what is in use by Doom 3.
<br /><br />Another thing that made me laugh, the light guards knees seem to be glued together like he is desperate for a pee.
<br /><br />I may have missed some setting somewhere, but I failed to find an option to enable a crosshair. That in itself was incredibly frustrating. If there is an option for a crosshair, please post here how to get it.
<br /><br />Not bad, not bad at all, but not overly amazing either. Will be interested to see where the rest of the project goes though as it has the potential to be extremly interesting and fun to play.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107644" date="Posted: Wed Aug 10, 2005 6:14 pm "><author>AO</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Cool, I'm downloading the mod now!

(I'm not sugarcoating anything btw )
<br /><br />I was running this with:
<br />Barton 2800+
<br />GF 6600gt 128
<br />Asus Nforce2
<br />1024 mb ram
<br />And I played it at hard.
<br /><br />Bugs:
<br />* The installer installed all the files directly in my Doom3 root. (in this case e:\spel\Doom 3) instead of the directory that it created for the mod.
<br />* The icon created didn't lead to the actual mod/game (as previously stated)
<br />* No crosshair option. (If I had known what the consol command for it was, I had probably had been having more fun. Checking your aim by watching where the bullets land have a certain charm in itself though. :p)
<br />* Am I just tired, or was there no auto run?
<br />* When the "barrels" explode they leave a debries, that seconds later instantly disappears. Why not just blow it all up at once?
<br />* It's running quite slow. I get dips to 40fps all the time.
<br />* The game bogs down to 1-5 fps in the last map's final areas (where you open the drainwell) and I can't for the life of me figure out why. 
<br />* Add a music volume lever in the System settings menu.
<br />* When it starts I hear "Computer updated" I hit F1 but noting happens. I hit tab but nothing happens. I look in the controls setup and find nothing. So what computer is updated?
<br />* In the first map, when you jumped out of the little crawl space down into the water, you can't get back. (I wanna go get that andrenalin pack in the beginning, since I didn't need it before but do now when I meet heavy opposition from a gun turret and flying ships and stuff)
<br />* These screenshots display how I found the models to need some more work.
<br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.darch-angel.com/temporary/q2lm01.jpg" class="postlink">Shot1 - arm</a> | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.darch-angel.com/temporary/q2lm02.jpg" class="postlink">Shot2 - Rear pelvis</a> | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.darch-angel.com/temporary/q2lm03.jpg" class="postlink">Shot3 - Flying corpses</a> | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.darch-angel.com/temporary/q2lm04.jpg" class="postlink">Shot4 - Remnant Light</a>
<br /><br />Design-flaws: (This of course is a matter of opinion more than anything)
<br />* The textures show that they are not the least 3d. Generally they look ok, but many of them really shows how they are drawn in Photoshop/PSP/whatever and the bumpmapping of them really gives off a sense of "Nvidia normalmap filter" usage. And in some cases it doesn't look like they even have any bumpmap.
<br />* The light guards go down way to hard. IMO they should go down on one shotgun blast. instead I need to use two, and since I didn't have any crosshair, even then they wouldn't always go down. (even if I shot them in the head at point blank range, sure they got a visor. But still they're the weakest enemy in the whole game.).
<br />* The music drove me nuts. It was too repetetive and too boring. After hearing the same short piece in the last map over and over again I was ready to scream. (I'd like to note that I actually love the Quake2 soundtrack, and still after all these years listen to it.)
<br />* It's way too dark. It's even darker than Doom3. And I only have the blaster to light my way. Quake2 is not this dark. 
<br />* In the last map there's an andrenaline pack on a floating crate, Why can't I jump up on that crate and grab it? Am I Stephen Hawkins?
<br />* Why did you make the first map MORE linear than the original?
<br />* Atleast replace the skin of the grenade for this version. It's way out of place now.
<br />* <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.darch-angel.com/temporary/q2lm05.jpg" class="postlink">Water level after draining.</a>
<br />* The orange light guards skins are too slick and clean. They don't match well with the surroundings.
<br />* Sometimes I mistook the machinegun for the shotgun. Might just have been because I was unfamiliar with them.
<br />* I think you should work more on making the new monsters look like actual discusting cyborgs. Right now they don't give me much of that feeling, just regular soldiers. With guns for hands. (in other words, work on the skins some more, make them a bit more menacing)
<br />* The water was quite nice, but the shader effect on it (heathaze I assume) is running way to fast. It's too active to be just lying there in puddles. Now it's moving around like it was a stream or it was raining on it.
<br /><br />That's all I can think of for now. I'll be back later to complain some more. :p</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107659" date="Posted: Wed Aug 10, 2005 8:24 pm "><author>Kiltron</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks for the feedback Kristus.

(even if I shot them in the head at point blank range, sure they got a visor. But still they're the weakest enemy in the whole game.).
<br />* The music drove me nuts. It was too repetetive and too boring. After hearing the same short piece in the last map over and over again I was ready to scream. (I'd like to note that I actually love the Quake2 soundtrack, and still after all these years listen to it.)
<br />* It's way too dark. It's even darker than Doom3. And I only have the blaster to light my way. Quake2 is not this dark. 
<br />* In the last map there's an andrenaline pack on a floating crate, Why can't I jump up on that crate and grab it? Am I Stephen Hawkins?
<br />* Why did you make the first map MORE linear than the original?
<br />* Atleast replace the skin of the grenade for this version. It's way out of place now.
<br />* <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.darch-angel.com/temporary/q2lm05.jpg" class="postlink">Water level after draining.</a>
<br />* The orange light guards skins are too slick and clean. They don't match well with the surroundings.
<br />* Sometimes I mistook the machinegun for the shotgun. Might just have been because I was unfamiliar with them.
<br />* I think you should work more on making the new monsters look like actual discusting cyborgs. Right now they don't give me much of that feeling, just regular soldiers. With guns for hands. (in other words, work on the skins some more, make them a bit more menacing)
<br />* The water was quite nice, but the shader effect on it (heathaze I assume) is running way to fast. It's too active to be just lying there in puddles. Now it's moving around like it was a stream or it was raining on it.
<br /><br />That's all I can think of for now. I'll be back later to complain some more. :p</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107659" date="Posted: Wed Aug 10, 2005 8:24 pm "><author>Kiltron</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks for the feedback Kristus.

<br /><br />It's finally here. The highly anticipated release of the Quake II: Lost Marine QuakeCon 2005 Test Build for DOOM 3. Get your guns and gear ready for this action packed remix of Quake II within the DOOM 3 engine. Engage in high combat situations in all new areas with all new gameplay.

<br /><br />The only real gripe I have is the installer, as you aren't prompted for the location of Doom 3.

<br /><br />I found the game to chug worse than any other mod or expansion Ive used with Doom 3 - there are only two things I can think of that would cause this:
<br /><br />1) Poorly optimised mapping - little use of visportals and/or poorly structured geometry. Without looking at the maps in the editor I wont know.
<br /><br />2) Doom 3 doesnt seem to like loading too much data up from a mod folder. The more custom resources you use, the more slower the game seems to run. In the case of this project, it is a complete total conversion and this might be why the game goes so slowly compared to other mods etc...
<br /><br />Generally speaking it seems ok to play through but for me it is isnt that far of a step forward from the original. Someone also stated that there were a lot more lights because its more lighter than standard Doom 3 levels. I tend to disagree with this, the maps in this project seem just as dark as in Doom 3 - I fail to see where extra lights would be used over what is in use by Doom 3.
<br /><br />Another thing that made me laugh, the light guards knees seem to be glued together like he is desperate for a pee.
<br /><br />I may have missed some setting somewhere, but I failed to find an option to enable a crosshair. That in itself was incredibly frustrating. If there is an option for a crosshair, please post here how to get it.
<br /><br />Not bad, not bad at all, but not overly amazing either. Will be interested to see where the rest of the project goes though as it has the potential to be extremly interesting and fun to play.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107644" date="Posted: Wed Aug 10, 2005 6:14 pm "><author>AO</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Cool, I'm downloading the mod now!

(I'm not sugarcoating anything btw )
<br /><br />I was running this with:
<br />Barton 2800+
<br />GF 6600gt 128
<br />Asus Nforce2
<br />1024 mb ram
<br />And I played it at hard.
<br /><br />Bugs:
<br />* The installer installed all the files directly in my Doom3 root. (in this case e:\spel\Doom 3) instead of the directory that it created for the mod.
<br />* The icon created didn't lead to the actual mod/game (as previously stated)
<br />* No crosshair option. (If I had known what the consol command for it was, I had probably had been having more fun. Checking your aim by watching where the bullets land have a certain charm in itself though. :p)
<br />* Am I just tired, or was there no auto run?
<br />* When the "barrels" explode they leave a debries, that seconds later instantly disappears. Why not just blow it all up at once?
<br />* It's running quite slow. I get dips to 40fps all the time.
<br />* The game bogs down to 1-5 fps in the last map's final areas (where you open the drainwell) and I can't for the life of me figure out why. 
<br />* Add a music volume lever in the System settings menu.
<br />* When it starts I hear "Computer updated" I hit F1 but noting happens. I hit tab but nothing happens. I look in the controls setup and find nothing. So what computer is updated?
<br />* In the first map, when you jumped out of the little crawl space down into the water, you can't get back. (I wanna go get that andrenalin pack in the beginning, since I didn't need it before but do now when I meet heavy opposition from a gun turret and flying ships and stuff)
<br />* These screenshots display how I found the models to need some more work.
<br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.darch-angel.com/temporary/q2lm01.jpg" class="postlink">Shot1 - arm</a> | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.darch-angel.com/temporary/q2lm02.jpg" class="postlink">Shot2 - Rear pelvis</a> | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.darch-angel.com/temporary/q2lm03.jpg" class="postlink">Shot3 - Flying corpses</a> | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.darch-angel.com/temporary/q2lm04.jpg" class="postlink">Shot4 - Remnant Light</a>
<br /><br />Design-flaws: (This of course is a matter of opinion more than anything)
<br />* The textures show that they are not the least 3d. Generally they look ok, but many of them really shows how they are drawn in Photoshop/PSP/whatever and the bumpmapping of them really gives off a sense of "Nvidia normalmap filter" usage. And in some cases it doesn't look like they even have any bumpmap.
<br />* The light guards go down way to hard. IMO they should go down on one shotgun blast. instead I need to use two, and since I didn't have any crosshair, even then they wouldn't always go down. (even if I shot them in the head at point blank range, sure they got a visor. But still they're the weakest enemy in the whole game.).
<br />* The music drove me nuts. It was too repetetive and too boring. After hearing the same short piece in the last map over and over again I was ready to scream. (I'd like to note that I actually love the Quake2 soundtrack, and still after all these years listen to it.)
<br />* It's way too dark. It's even darker than Doom3. And I only have the blaster to light my way. Quake2 is not this dark. 
<br />* In the last map there's an andrenaline pack on a floating crate, Why can't I jump up on that crate and grab it? Am I Stephen Hawkins?
<br />* Why did you make the first map MORE linear than the original?
<br />* Atleast replace the skin of the grenade for this version. It's way out of place now.

I tend to disagree with this, the maps in this project seem just as dark as in Doom 3 - I fail to see where extra lights would be used over what is in use by Doom 3.
<br /><br />Another thing that made me laugh, the light guards knees seem to be glued together like he is desperate for a pee.
<br /><br />I may have missed some setting somewhere, but I failed to find an option to enable a crosshair. That in itself was incredibly frustrating. If there is an option for a crosshair, please post here how to get it.
<br /><br />Not bad, not bad at all, but not overly amazing either. Will be interested to see where the rest of the project goes though as it has the potential to be extremly interesting and fun to play.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107644" date="Posted: Wed Aug 10, 2005 6:14 pm "><author>AO</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Cool, I'm downloading the mod now!

(I'm not sugarcoating anything btw )
<br /><br />I was running this with:
<br />Barton 2800+
<br />GF 6600gt 128
<br />Asus Nforce2
<br />1024 mb ram
<br />And I played it at hard.
<br /><br />Bugs:
<br />* The installer installed all the files directly in my Doom3 root. (in this case e:\spel\Doom 3) instead of the directory that it created for the mod.
<br />* The icon created didn't lead to the actual mod/game (as previously stated)
<br />* No crosshair option. (If I had known what the consol command for it was, I had probably had been having more fun. Checking your aim by watching where the bullets land have a certain charm in itself though. :p)
<br />* Am I just tired, or was there no auto run?
<br />* When the "barrels" explode they leave a debries, that seconds later instantly disappears. Why not just blow it all up at once?
<br />* It's running quite slow. I get dips to 40fps all the time.
<br />* The game bogs down to 1-5 fps in the last map's final areas (where you open the drainwell) and I can't for the life of me figure out why. 
<br />* Add a music volume lever in the System settings menu.
<br />* When it starts I hear "Computer updated" I hit F1 but noting happens. I hit tab but nothing happens. I look in the controls setup and find nothing. So what computer is updated?
<br />* In the first map, when you jumped out of the little crawl space down into the water, you can't get back. (I wanna go get that andrenalin pack in the beginning, since I didn't need it before but do now when I meet heavy opposition from a gun turret and flying ships and stuff)
<br />* These screenshots display how I found the models to need some more work.
<br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.darch-angel.com/temporary/q2lm01.jpg" class="postlink">Shot1 - arm</a> | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.darch-angel.com/temporary/q2lm02.jpg" class="postlink">Shot2 - Rear pelvis</a> | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.darch-angel.com/temporary/q2lm03.jpg" class="postlink">Shot3 - Flying corpses</a> | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.darch-angel.com/temporary/q2lm04.jpg" class="postlink">Shot4 - Remnant Light</a>
<br /><br />Design-flaws: (This of course is a matter of opinion more than anything)
<br />* The textures show that they are not the least 3d. Generally they look ok, but many of them really shows how they are drawn in Photoshop/PSP/whatever and the bumpmapping of them really gives off a sense of "Nvidia normalmap filter" usage. And in some cases it doesn't look like they even have any bumpmap.
<br />* The light guards go down way to hard. IMO they should go down on one shotgun blast. instead I need to use two, and since I didn't have any crosshair, even then they wouldn't always go down. (even if I shot them in the head at point blank range, sure they got a visor. But still they're the weakest enemy in the whole game.).
<br />* The music drove me nuts. It was too repetetive and too boring. After hearing the same short piece in the last map over and over again I was ready to scream. (I'd like to note that I actually love the Quake2 soundtrack, and still after all these years listen to it.)
<br />* It's way too dark. It's even darker than Doom3. And I only have the blaster to light my way. Quake2 is not this dark. 
<br />* In the last map there's an andrenaline pack on a floating crate, Why can't I jump up on that crate and grab it? Am I Stephen Hawkins?
<br />* Why did you make the first map MORE linear than the original?
<br />* Atleast replace the skin of the grenade for this version. It's way out of place now.
<br />* <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.darch-angel.com/temporary/q2lm05.jpg" class="postlink">Water level after draining.</a>
<br />* The orange light guards skins are too slick and clean. They don't match well with the surroundings.
<br />* Sometimes I mistook the machinegun for the shotgun. Might just have been because I was unfamiliar with them.
<br />* I think you should work more on making the new monsters look like actual discusting cyborgs. Right now they don't give me much of that feeling, just regular soldiers. With guns for hands. (in other words, work on the skins some more, make them a bit more menacing)
<br />* The water was quite nice, but the shader effect on it (heathaze I assume) is running way to fast. It's too active to be just lying there in puddles. Now it's moving around like it was a stream or it was raining on it.
<br /><br />That's all I can think of for now. I'll be back later to complain some more. :p</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107659" date="Posted: Wed Aug 10, 2005 8:24 pm "><author>Kiltron</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks for the feedback Kristus.

<br /><br />It's finally here. The highly anticipated release of the Quake II: Lost Marine QuakeCon 2005 Test Build for DOOM 3. Get your guns and gear ready for this action packed remix of Quake II within the DOOM 3 engine. Engage in high combat situations in all new areas with all new gameplay.

<br /><br />This is a Single Player Demo only. This is not the full or final polished release of the mod. This is only a test build, for progress showing and bug feedback reporting. There are still things we need to finish, including animations, code, art etc. It's packaged in a Windows Installer and is also ready for burning a backup copy of the mod to CD. Don't forget to grab your CD Labels on the Downloads page as well.
<br /><br />It's been a tough 4 months developing this demo, but I promised to have something playable by QuakeCon 2005 and I delivered on that promise. Everyone did an excellent job. So without further delay, go download the mod and kick some Strogg ass!

<br /><br />The only real gripe I have is the installer, as you aren't prompted for the location of Doom 3.

(Though I followed their directions to a T, there's checkboxes they say to use missing from my application so I was at a loss on what to do)
<br /><br />You can choose any path you want to install to, and the mod will install to it, it just doesn't update the path you see after you picked a new one and doesn't apply that new path to the mod shortcuts.

<br /><br />I found the game to chug worse than any other mod or expansion Ive used with Doom 3 - there are only two things I can think of that would cause this:
<br /><br />1) Poorly optimised mapping - little use of visportals and/or poorly structured geometry. Without looking at the maps in the editor I wont know.
<br /><br />2) Doom 3 doesnt seem to like loading too much data up from a mod folder. The more custom resources you use, the more slower the game seems to run. In the case of this project, it is a complete total conversion and this might be why the game goes so slowly compared to other mods etc...
<br /><br />Generally speaking it seems ok to play through but for me it is isnt that far of a step forward from the original.

<br /><br />I found the game to chug worse than any other mod or expansion Ive used with Doom 3 - there are only two things I can think of that would cause this:
<br /><br />1) Poorly optimised mapping - little use of visportals and/or poorly structured geometry. Without looking at the maps in the editor I wont know.
<br /><br />2) Doom 3 doesnt seem to like loading too much data up from a mod folder. The more custom resources you use, the more slower the game seems to run. In the case of this project, it is a complete total conversion and this might be why the game goes so slowly compared to other mods etc...
<br /><br />Generally speaking it seems ok to play through but for me it is isnt that far of a step forward from the original. Someone also stated that there were a lot more lights because its more lighter than standard Doom 3 levels. I tend to disagree with this, the maps in this project seem just as dark as in Doom 3 - I fail to see where extra lights would be used over what is in use by Doom 3.
<br /><br />Another thing that made me laugh, the light guards knees seem to be glued together like he is desperate for a pee.
<br /><br />I may have missed some setting somewhere, but I failed to find an option to enable a crosshair. That in itself was incredibly frustrating. If there is an option for a crosshair, please post here how to get it.
<br /><br />Not bad, not bad at all, but not overly amazing either.

(I'm not sugarcoating anything btw )
<br /><br />I was running this with:
<br />Barton 2800+
<br />GF 6600gt 128
<br />Asus Nforce2
<br />1024 mb ram
<br />And I played it at hard.
<br /><br />Bugs:
<br />* The installer installed all the files directly in my Doom3 root. (in this case e:\spel\Doom 3) instead of the directory that it created for the mod.
<br />* The icon created didn't lead to the actual mod/game (as previously stated)
<br />* No crosshair option. (If I had known what the consol command for it was, I had probably had been having more fun. Checking your aim by watching where the bullets land have a certain charm in itself though. :p)
<br />* Am I just tired, or was there no auto run?
<br />* When the "barrels" explode they leave a debries, that seconds later instantly disappears. Why not just blow it all up at once?
<br />* It's running quite slow. I get dips to 40fps all the time.
<br />* The game bogs down to 1-5 fps in the last map's final areas (where you open the drainwell) and I can't for the life of me figure out why. 
<br />* Add a music volume lever in the System settings menu.
<br />* When it starts I hear "Computer updated" I hit F1 but noting happens. I hit tab but nothing happens. I look in the controls setup and find nothing. So what computer is updated?
<br />* In the first map, when you jumped out of the little crawl space down into the water, you can't get back. (I wanna go get that andrenalin pack in the beginning, since I didn't need it before but do now when I meet heavy opposition from a gun turret and flying ships and stuff)
<br />* These screenshots display how I found the models to need some more work.

<br /><br />Design-flaws: (This of course is a matter of opinion more than anything)
<br />* The textures show that they are not the least 3d. Generally they look ok, but many of them really shows how they are drawn in Photoshop/PSP/whatever and the bumpmapping of them really gives off a sense of "Nvidia normalmap filter" usage. And in some cases it doesn't look like they even have any bumpmap.
<br />* The light guards go down way to hard. IMO they should go down on one shotgun blast. instead I need to use two, and since I didn't have any crosshair, even then they wouldn't always go down. (even if I shot them in the head at point blank range, sure they got a visor. But still they're the weakest enemy in the whole game.).
<br />* The music drove me nuts. It was too repetetive and too boring. After hearing the same short piece in the last map over and over again I was ready to scream. (I'd like to note that I actually love the Quake2 soundtrack, and still after all these years listen to it.)
<br />* It's way too dark. It's even darker than Doom3. And I only have the blaster to light my way. Quake2 is not this dark. 
<br />* In the last map there's an andrenaline pack on a floating crate, Why can't I jump up on that crate and grab it? Am I Stephen Hawkins?
<br />* Why did you make the first map MORE linear than the original?
<br />* Atleast replace the skin of the grenade for this version. It's way out of place now.
<br />* <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.darch-angel.com/temporary/q2lm05.jpg" class="postlink">Water level after draining.</a>
<br />* The orange light guards skins are too slick and clean. They don't match well with the surroundings.
<br />* Sometimes I mistook the machinegun for the shotgun. Might just have been because I was unfamiliar with them.
<br />* I think you should work more on making the new monsters look like actual discusting cyborgs. Right now they don't give me much of that feeling, just regular soldiers. With guns for hands. (in other words, work on the skins some more, make them a bit more menacing)
<br />* The water was quite nice, but the shader effect on it (heathaze I assume) is running way to fast. It's too active to be just lying there in puddles. Now it's moving around like it was a stream or it was raining on it.
<br /><br />That's all I can think of for now. I'll be back later to complain some more. :p</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107659" date="Posted: Wed Aug 10, 2005 8:24 pm "><author>Kiltron</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks for the feedback Kristus.

<br /><br />It's finally here. The highly anticipated release of the Quake II: Lost Marine QuakeCon 2005 Test Build for DOOM 3. Get your guns and gear ready for this action packed remix of Quake II within the DOOM 3 engine. Engage in high combat situations in all new areas with all new gameplay. Fight various Strogg enemies along your way including Enforcers, Light Guards and Flyers. Take them out with your Blaster, Double Barrel Shotgun, or other aresenal that you come across. Find secrets and secret areas and powerups. Unlock secret extra content, and much more!
<br /><br />This is a Single Player Demo only. This is not the full or final polished release of the mod. This is only a test build, for progress showing and bug feedback reporting. There are still things we need to finish, including animations, code, art etc. It's packaged in a Windows Installer and is also ready for burning a backup copy of the mod to CD. Don't forget to grab your CD Labels on the Downloads page as well.
<br /><br />It's been a tough 4 months developing this demo, but I promised to have something playable by QuakeCon 2005 and I delivered on that promise. Everyone did an excellent job. So without further delay, go download the mod and kick some Strogg ass!

<br /><br />After the first loading screen it took me a few seconds to realize it wasn't Quake 2, which is a good thing.
<br /><br />It's a little sluggish on my rig but I'm more to blame for that than you. I realize that you're using more lights than the stock Doom 3 maps in order to make the levels in the mod well lit so it's a given that performance won't be quite as good.
<br /><br />The only real gripe I have is the installer, as you aren't prompted for the location of Doom 3. It just assumes that you've installed Doom 3 in C:\Program Files\Doom 3\ which means you have to move the mod and change the shortcut.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107592" date="Posted: Wed Aug 10, 2005 7:54 am "><author>psyborg</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">been playing it quite for a good while now. heres my critique
<br /><br />mapping: brilliant, although a little chuggy in some spots i had to turn video settings to medium.
<br /><br />weapons: very good, love them.
<br /><br />enemies: they all look good but the light enforcer needs more animation alot of the time he seems to be gliding around, and have him aim his gun higher looks like hes pointing it downward. flyer and enforcer are great. 
<br /><br />items: they look good but i dont like the way they light up, looks weird.

<br /><br />After the first loading screen it took me a few seconds to realize it wasn't Quake 2, which is a good thing.
<br /><br />It's a little sluggish on my rig but I'm more to blame for that than you. I realize that you're using more lights than the stock Doom 3 maps in order to make the levels in the mod well lit so it's a given that performance won't be quite as good.
<br /><br />The only real gripe I have is the installer, as you aren't prompted for the location of Doom 3. It just assumes that you've installed Doom 3 in C:\Program Files\Doom 3\ which means you have to move the mod and change the shortcut.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107592" date="Posted: Wed Aug 10, 2005 7:54 am "><author>psyborg</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">been playing it quite for a good while now. heres my critique

(Though I followed their directions to a T, there's checkboxes they say to use missing from my application so I was at a loss on what to do)
<br /><br />You can choose any path you want to install to, and the mod will install to it, it just doesn't update the path you see after you picked a new one and doesn't apply that new path to the mod shortcuts.

<br /><br />I found the game to chug worse than any other mod or expansion Ive used with Doom 3 - there are only two things I can think of that would cause this:
<br /><br />1) Poorly optimised mapping - little use of visportals and/or poorly structured geometry. Without looking at the maps in the editor I wont know.
<br /><br />2) Doom 3 doesnt seem to like loading too much data up from a mod folder. The more custom resources you use, the more slower the game seems to run. In the case of this project, it is a complete total conversion and this might be why the game goes so slowly compared to other mods etc...
<br /><br />Generally speaking it seems ok to play through but for me it is isnt that far of a step forward from the original. Someone also stated that there were a lot more lights because its more lighter than standard Doom 3 levels. I tend to disagree with this, the maps in this project seem just as dark as in Doom 3 - I fail to see where extra lights would be used over what is in use by Doom 3.
<br /><br />Another thing that made me laugh, the light guards knees seem to be glued together like he is desperate for a pee.
<br /><br />I may have missed some setting somewhere, but I failed to find an option to enable a crosshair. That in itself was incredibly frustrating. If there is an option for a crosshair, please post here how to get it.
<br /><br />Not bad, not bad at all, but not overly amazing either. Will be interested to see where the rest of the project goes though as it has the potential to be extremly interesting and fun to play.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107644" date="Posted: Wed Aug 10, 2005 6:14 pm "><author>AO</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Cool, I'm downloading the mod now!

(I'm not sugarcoating anything btw )
<br /><br />I was running this with:
<br />Barton 2800+
<br />GF 6600gt 128
<br />Asus Nforce2
<br />1024 mb ram
<br />And I played it at hard.
<br /><br />Bugs:
<br />* The installer installed all the files directly in my Doom3 root. (in this case e:\spel\Doom 3) instead of the directory that it created for the mod.
<br />* The icon created didn't lead to the actual mod/game (as previously stated)
<br />* No crosshair option. (If I had known what the consol command for it was, I had probably had been having more fun. Checking your aim by watching where the bullets land have a certain charm in itself though. :p)
<br />* Am I just tired, or was there no auto run?
<br />* When the "barrels" explode they leave a debries, that seconds later instantly disappears. Why not just blow it all up at once?
<br />* It's running quite slow. I get dips to 40fps all the time.
<br />* The game bogs down to 1-5 fps in the last map's final areas (where you open the drainwell) and I can't for the life of me figure out why. 
<br />* Add a music volume lever in the System settings menu.
<br />* When it starts I hear "Computer updated" I hit F1 but noting happens. I hit tab but nothing happens. I look in the controls setup and find nothing. So what computer is updated?
<br />* In the first map, when you jumped out of the little crawl space down into the water, you can't get back. (I wanna go get that andrenalin pack in the beginning, since I didn't need it before but do now when I meet heavy opposition from a gun turret and flying ships and stuff)
<br />* These screenshots display how I found the models to need some more work.
<br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.darch-angel.com/temporary/q2lm01.jpg" class="postlink">Shot1 - arm</a> | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.darch-angel.com/temporary/q2lm02.jpg" class="postlink">Shot2 - Rear pelvis</a> | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.darch-angel.com/temporary/q2lm03.jpg" class="postlink">Shot3 - Flying corpses</a> | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.darch-angel.com/temporary/q2lm04.jpg" class="postlink">Shot4 - Remnant Light</a>
<br /><br />Design-flaws: (This of course is a matter of opinion more than anything)
<br />* The textures show that they are not the least 3d. Generally they look ok, but many of them really shows how they are drawn in Photoshop/PSP/whatever and the bumpmapping of them really gives off a sense of "Nvidia normalmap filter" usage. And in some cases it doesn't look like they even have any bumpmap.
<br />* The light guards go down way to hard. IMO they should go down on one shotgun blast. instead I need to use two, and since I didn't have any crosshair, even then they wouldn't always go down. (even if I shot them in the head at point blank range, sure they got a visor. But still they're the weakest enemy in the whole game.).
<br />* The music drove me nuts. It was too repetetive and too boring. After hearing the same short piece in the last map over and over again I was ready to scream. (I'd like to note that I actually love the Quake2 soundtrack, and still after all these years listen to it.)
<br />* It's way too dark. It's even darker than Doom3. And I only have the blaster to light my way. Quake2 is not this dark. 
<br />* In the last map there's an andrenaline pack on a floating crate, Why can't I jump up on that crate and grab it? Am I Stephen Hawkins?
<br />* Why did you make the first map MORE linear than the original?
<br />* Atleast replace the skin of the grenade for this version. It's way out of place now.
<br />* <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.darch-angel.com/temporary/q2lm05.jpg" class="postlink">Water level after draining.</a>
<br />* The orange light guards skins are too slick and clean. They don't match well with the surroundings.
<br />* Sometimes I mistook the machinegun for the shotgun. Might just have been because I was unfamiliar with them.
<br />* I think you should work more on making the new monsters look like actual discusting cyborgs. Right now they don't give me much of that feeling, just regular soldiers. With guns for hands. (in other words, work on the skins some more, make them a bit more menacing)
<br />* The water was quite nice, but the shader effect on it (heathaze I assume) is running way to fast. It's too active to be just lying there in puddles. Now it's moving around like it was a stream or it was raining on it.
<br /><br />That's all I can think of for now. I'll be back later to complain some more. :p</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107659" date="Posted: Wed Aug 10, 2005 8:24 pm "><author>Kiltron</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks for the feedback Kristus.

My thoughts:
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Bad Stuff</span></span>
<br />- Way, way, WAY too hard IMO. I lost close to 40 health trying to get out of the starting area and into the rest of the base. I cowardly turned on God mode just so I could live to see the rest of the demo. (yes, I know, shame on me <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> )
<br />- Health doesn't do much. I mean, +2 Health, +10 Health? The light shotgunners and machine gunners will take that out with their first shots. Health should really do more, especially given the amount of enemies that one must fight and how much damage they can inflict in a short time period. I can tell already that Gunners are gonna eat thru 100 health like it's nothing, and that's not even with grenades.
<br />- The Fliers seem compelled to get up-close, which I find strange because it makes them an easy target since one shotgun blast kills them. They should probably hang back more and dodge more frequently, since their blasters are more of a menace than anything else.
<br />- A crosshair is definately needed in order to fire true. I wasn't sure what I was hitting, if anything.
<br />- Most of the Light Guards went down smoothly, but sometimes they could take a direct shotgun blast to the head without going down. You may need to adjust their health slightly. Or add the crosshair, as aim may have been off slightly in some cases.
<br />- The marine is missing from the opening sequence. Seriously, I did not see him at all.
<br />- At the end of Outer Base, at the exit elevator, I fired Blaster shots into the elevator to see better. There was nothing in there. I went to open the doors, and when they slid open there was an Enforcer inside, which made absolutely no sense. Consider making the door solid instead, removing the Enforcer, or having the elevator sit in a lowered state by default, so when it comes up, the doors open and the Enforcer steps out to attack.
<br />- It's too dark, though I guess this is mostly the engine's fault. The exit elevator, however, should've had SOME light cast upon it, since it was pitch black. There were other areas like this as well, especially in Installation.
<br />- The Fliers seem to be in a state of perpetual darkness. Maybe it was just the locations I was fighting them, but it seemed to me as if they were under permanent shadow.
<br />- The AI needs work. The enemies seemed capable of shooting forever, which makes life extraordinarily difficult. Even the Z-Sec and Zombie Commandoes need time to reload, and they have the power of Hell on their side.
<br />- For the short time that I was taking damage, my plight didn't seem noticeable. I lost 40 points of health in the first 2 minutes and not so much as a grunt was heard from me. There was also nothing to indicate that I was taking damage at all, I just found myself with less health all of a sudden. The effects of taking damage should be more obvious, and I should make some noise when getting hit.
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Good Stuff</span></span>
<br />- Water. The water was cool. My only gripe is that you sink too fast and floating is difficult to accomplish. You should sink slowly, but not too slowly since you have an arsenal of weapons and armor to carry around.
<br />- The weapons look spiffy. I think the firing animation for the Blaster could use improvement though.
<br />- The bodies integrated into the base near the end of Installation were a nice, creepy touch.
<br />- I liked shattering the glass in a lot of places. It was nice to have some destructible elements at hand.
<br /><br />There's not a whole lot more that I can think of, but those are the things I think need work.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107686" date="Posted: Wed Aug 10, 2005 10:44 pm "><author>Kristus</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">heXum wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">-Strogg don't speak english.

<br /><br />Yes, I reacted on this too at first. But then I remembered that all (many atleast) the signs in Quake 2 was in fact in english. So I am quite perplexed on that matter.

(I'm not counting consol and menu fonts etc) and that's the "Stroggo language" and english. Unfortunately they are very scarce as back in the days of q2, they only mostly 128x128 sized textures, and that let them get away with little red lines portraying as text. :p
<br /><br />But I got screenshots of the two examples. They're not much, but it might be enough to fill your needs.
<br />This is the best example I could find of the Stroggo fontstyle. This one is not that important to get right, since unlike Cyan, id didn't actually invent an entire language. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.darch-angel.com/temporary/stroggofnt.jpg">http://www.darch-angel.com/temporary/stroggofnt.jpg</a><!-- m -->

<br /><br />While the other reminds me of one called "Gothic 107" and another called "Ekster 1.00", aswell as "MindFields 1.0" (this one is even hard/impossible to read).

<br /><br />Those right there are definite factors in your performance. Through my testings, SP2 hurts FPS when running DOOM 3. (could differ on other machines however, but it affected it on my dev box)
<br /><br />The TI 4600 isn't a recommended card for D3 itself, though it does run it. I pushed the bar with the engine and mod by using many 2048's so anything less than a GF6800 and 512RAM isn't suggested. I targeted high end systems. GF6800-7800 1024-2048RAM. The mod itself doesn't run poorly, it just requires steeper hardware specs.
<br /><br />Crylar, updgrade D3 to the 1.3 Patch.

My thoughts:
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Bad Stuff</span></span>
<br />- Way, way, WAY too hard IMO. I lost close to 40 health trying to get out of the starting area and into the rest of the base. I cowardly turned on God mode just so I could live to see the rest of the demo. (yes, I know, shame on me <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> )
<br />- Health doesn't do much. I mean, +2 Health, +10 Health? The light shotgunners and machine gunners will take that out with their first shots. Health should really do more, especially given the amount of enemies that one must fight and how much damage they can inflict in a short time period. I can tell already that Gunners are gonna eat thru 100 health like it's nothing, and that's not even with grenades.
<br />- The Fliers seem compelled to get up-close, which I find strange because it makes them an easy target since one shotgun blast kills them. They should probably hang back more and dodge more frequently, since their blasters are more of a menace than anything else.
<br />- A crosshair is definately needed in order to fire true. I wasn't sure what I was hitting, if anything.
<br />- Most of the Light Guards went down smoothly, but sometimes they could take a direct shotgun blast to the head without going down. You may need to adjust their health slightly. Or add the crosshair, as aim may have been off slightly in some cases.
<br />- The marine is missing from the opening sequence. Seriously, I did not see him at all.
<br />- At the end of Outer Base, at the exit elevator, I fired Blaster shots into the elevator to see better. There was nothing in there. I went to open the doors, and when they slid open there was an Enforcer inside, which made absolutely no sense. Consider making the door solid instead, removing the Enforcer, or having the elevator sit in a lowered state by default, so when it comes up, the doors open and the Enforcer steps out to attack.
<br />- It's too dark, though I guess this is mostly the engine's fault. The exit elevator, however, should've had SOME light cast upon it, since it was pitch black. There were other areas like this as well, especially in Installation.
<br />- The Fliers seem to be in a state of perpetual darkness. Maybe it was just the locations I was fighting them, but it seemed to me as if they were under permanent shadow.
<br />- The AI needs work. The enemies seemed capable of shooting forever, which makes life extraordinarily difficult. Even the Z-Sec and Zombie Commandoes need time to reload, and they have the power of Hell on their side.
<br />- For the short time that I was taking damage, my plight didn't seem noticeable. I lost 40 points of health in the first 2 minutes and not so much as a grunt was heard from me. There was also nothing to indicate that I was taking damage at all, I just found myself with less health all of a sudden. The effects of taking damage should be more obvious, and I should make some noise when getting hit.
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Good Stuff</span></span>
<br />- Water. The water was cool. My only gripe is that you sink too fast and floating is difficult to accomplish. You should sink slowly, but not too slowly since you have an arsenal of weapons and armor to carry around.
<br />- The weapons look spiffy. I think the firing animation for the Blaster could use improvement though.
<br />- The bodies integrated into the base near the end of Installation were a nice, creepy touch.
<br />- I liked shattering the glass in a lot of places. It was nice to have some destructible elements at hand.
<br /><br />There's not a whole lot more that I can think of, but those are the things I think need work.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107686" date="Posted: Wed Aug 10, 2005 10:44 pm "><author>Kristus</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">heXum wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">-Strogg don't speak english.

<br /><br />Yes, I reacted on this too at first. But then I remembered that all (many atleast) the signs in Quake 2 was in fact in english. So I am quite perplexed on that matter. None of the stroggs actually speak any english. They got their cool Stroggish. But the signs in Q2 read in english, probably because you had to know where the warehouse actually were.

(I'm not counting consol and menu fonts etc) and that's the "Stroggo language" and english. Unfortunately they are very scarce as back in the days of q2, they only mostly 128x128 sized textures, and that let them get away with little red lines portraying as text. :p
<br /><br />But I got screenshots of the two examples. They're not much, but it might be enough to fill your needs.
<br />This is the best example I could find of the Stroggo fontstyle. This one is not that important to get right, since unlike Cyan, id didn't actually invent an entire language. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.darch-angel.com/temporary/stroggofnt.jpg">http://www.darch-angel.com/temporary/stroggofnt.jpg</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />And here's the english font, notice how some of the letters are flipped backwards though.

<br />THis one reminds me of a font called: Mael and another I can't remember what it's called, but it's the one used in this image: &lt;br&gt;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doomworld.com/unholy/island/images/logo.png" class="postlink">Link to an image with a fontstyle in it.</a>
<br /><br />While the other reminds me of one called "Gothic 107" and another called "Ekster 1.00", aswell as "MindFields 1.0" (this one is even hard/impossible to read).
<br /><br />I'm not saying that these fonts are any dead ringers or anything.

<br />- The Fliers seem compelled to get up-close, which I find strange because it makes them an easy target since one shotgun blast kills them. They should probably hang back more and dodge more frequently, since their blasters are more of a menace than anything else.
<br />- A crosshair is definately needed in order to fire true. I wasn't sure what I was hitting, if anything.
<br />- Most of the Light Guards went down smoothly, but sometimes they could take a direct shotgun blast to the head without going down. You may need to adjust their health slightly. Or add the crosshair, as aim may have been off slightly in some cases.
<br />- The marine is missing from the opening sequence. Seriously, I did not see him at all.
<br />- At the end of Outer Base, at the exit elevator, I fired Blaster shots into the elevator to see better. There was nothing in there. I went to open the doors, and when they slid open there was an Enforcer inside, which made absolutely no sense. Consider making the door solid instead, removing the Enforcer, or having the elevator sit in a lowered state by default, so when it comes up, the doors open and the Enforcer steps out to attack.
<br />- It's too dark, though I guess this is mostly the engine's fault. The exit elevator, however, should've had SOME light cast upon it, since it was pitch black. There were other areas like this as well, especially in Installation.
<br />- The Fliers seem to be in a state of perpetual darkness. Maybe it was just the locations I was fighting them, but it seemed to me as if they were under permanent shadow.
<br />- The AI needs work. The enemies seemed capable of shooting forever, which makes life extraordinarily difficult. Even the Z-Sec and Zombie Commandoes need time to reload, and they have the power of Hell on their side.
<br />- For the short time that I was taking damage, my plight didn't seem noticeable. I lost 40 points of health in the first 2 minutes and not so much as a grunt was heard from me. There was also nothing to indicate that I was taking damage at all, I just found myself with less health all of a sudden. The effects of taking damage should be more obvious, and I should make some noise when getting hit.
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Good Stuff</span></span>
<br />- Water. The water was cool. My only gripe is that you sink too fast and floating is difficult to accomplish. You should sink slowly, but not too slowly since you have an arsenal of weapons and armor to carry around.
<br />- The weapons look spiffy. I think the firing animation for the Blaster could use improvement though.
<br />- The bodies integrated into the base near the end of Installation were a nice, creepy touch.
<br />- I liked shattering the glass in a lot of places. It was nice to have some destructible elements at hand.
<br /><br />There's not a whole lot more that I can think of, but those are the things I think need work.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107686" date="Posted: Wed Aug 10, 2005 10:44 pm "><author>Kristus</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">heXum wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">-Strogg don't speak english.

I love this site and the helpful people that post here.  I have been visiting D3W since June '04 and have never posted anything.  Since Q2 is my favorite FPS, I figured my first post should be here.
<br /><br />Anyways, the mod is awesome but the textures really bugged me.  They look like they were taken straight from the Q2 retexturing site.  This wouldn't be a bad thing if they were made with a PPL engine in mind, but they weren't.  The diffuse stages all have shadows painted on them.  What's worse is that they were then run through a Normal Map filter, resulting in normal maps that are not that good.  
<br /><br />From my experince, normal maps look best if you make true bump maps first (or an actual 3d model) and then run that through the filter (preferably in many different stages and then flattened together).
<br /><br />Also, the normal maps should just be the major forms of the texture, ie bricks, panels, planks, etc..  Then use bumpmaps to create the actual imperfections  like weathering, rust, grain, etc.
<br /><br />Hope this helps out, and keep working because I cannot wait to play the full version.

<br /><br />I tested the mod (nice one) &amp; found that the game crashes each time I try to change the video quality. So I'm stuck in a "low" quality (any resolution seems to work), but I can't try "medium" or "high"...
<br /><br />Sys. spec.:
<br />- WinXP SP2
<br />- AthlonXP 2000+
<br />- NVIDIA GeForce4 TI 4600
<br />- 512 (RAM)
<br /><br />Oh, and I tested a logfile (qconsole..), but nothing special appeared on it...
<br /><br />EDIT: I forget to mention that the game crashes only during level loading (I tested both levels...), i.e. if I switch the game quality, everything goes fine (the game restarts,etc...), but if I try to play a level, then the game begins to load ressources &amp; crashes at that point:

<br />- NVIDIA GeForce4 TI 4600
<br /><br />Those right there are definite factors in your performance. Through my testings, SP2 hurts FPS when running DOOM 3. (could differ on other machines however, but it affected it on my dev box)
<br /><br />The TI 4600 isn't a recommended card for D3 itself, though it does run it. I pushed the bar with the engine and mod by using many 2048's so anything less than a GF6800 and 512RAM isn't suggested. I targeted high end systems. GF6800-7800 1024-2048RAM. The mod itself doesn't run poorly, it just requires steeper hardware specs.
<br /><br />Crylar, updgrade D3 to the 1.3 Patch.
<br /><br />SilentSoD, can you show me what misalignments you're talking about. Other than the Chaingun, I know it's not aligned.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107776" date="Posted: Thu Aug 11, 2005 4:50 pm "><author>Sebultura</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Kiltron =&gt; it's really strange, because I've just tested the game in a ultra quality mode (the mad guy that I am lol!) and the level load nice !!!!

My thoughts:
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Bad Stuff</span></span>
<br />- Way, way, WAY too hard IMO. I lost close to 40 health trying to get out of the starting area and into the rest of the base. I cowardly turned on God mode just so I could live to see the rest of the demo. (yes, I know, shame on me <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> )
<br />- Health doesn't do much. I mean, +2 Health, +10 Health? The light shotgunners and machine gunners will take that out with their first shots. Health should really do more, especially given the amount of enemies that one must fight and how much damage they can inflict in a short time period. I can tell already that Gunners are gonna eat thru 100 health like it's nothing, and that's not even with grenades.

<br /><br />From my experince, normal maps look best if you make true bump maps first (or an actual 3d model) and then run that through the filter (preferably in many different stages and then flattened together).
<br /><br />Also, the normal maps should just be the major forms of the texture, ie bricks, panels, planks, etc..  Then use bumpmaps to create the actual imperfections  like weathering, rust, grain, etc.
<br /><br />Hope this helps out, and keep working because I cannot wait to play the full version.

<br /><br />Those right there are definite factors in your performance. Through my testings, SP2 hurts FPS when running DOOM 3. (could differ on other machines however, but it affected it on my dev box)
<br /><br />The TI 4600 isn't a recommended card for D3 itself, though it does run it. I pushed the bar with the engine and mod by using many 2048's so anything less than a GF6800 and 512RAM isn't suggested. I targeted high end systems. GF6800-7800 1024-2048RAM. The mod itself doesn't run poorly, it just requires steeper hardware specs.
<br /><br />Crylar, updgrade D3 to the 1.3 Patch.

My thoughts:
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Bad Stuff</span></span>
<br />- Way, way, WAY too hard IMO. I lost close to 40 health trying to get out of the starting area and into the rest of the base. I cowardly turned on God mode just so I could live to see the rest of the demo. (yes, I know, shame on me <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> )
<br />- Health doesn't do much. I mean, +2 Health, +10 Health? The light shotgunners and machine gunners will take that out with their first shots. Health should really do more, especially given the amount of enemies that one must fight and how much damage they can inflict in a short time period. I can tell already that Gunners are gonna eat thru 100 health like it's nothing, and that's not even with grenades.
<br />- The Fliers seem compelled to get up-close, which I find strange because it makes them an easy target since one shotgun blast kills them. They should probably hang back more and dodge more frequently, since their blasters are more of a menace than anything else.
<br />- A crosshair is definately needed in order to fire true. I wasn't sure what I was hitting, if anything.
<br />- Most of the Light Guards went down smoothly, but sometimes they could take a direct shotgun blast to the head without going down. You may need to adjust their health slightly. Or add the crosshair, as aim may have been off slightly in some cases.
<br />- The marine is missing from the opening sequence. Seriously, I did not see him at all.
<br />- At the end of Outer Base, at the exit elevator, I fired Blaster shots into the elevator to see better. There was nothing in there. I went to open the doors, and when they slid open there was an Enforcer inside, which made absolutely no sense. Consider making the door solid instead, removing the Enforcer, or having the elevator sit in a lowered state by default, so when it comes up, the doors open and the Enforcer steps out to attack.
<br />- It's too dark, though I guess this is mostly the engine's fault. The exit elevator, however, should've had SOME light cast upon it, since it was pitch black. There were other areas like this as well, especially in Installation.
<br />- The Fliers seem to be in a state of perpetual darkness. Maybe it was just the locations I was fighting them, but it seemed to me as if they were under permanent shadow.
<br />- The AI needs work. The enemies seemed capable of shooting forever, which makes life extraordinarily difficult. Even the Z-Sec and Zombie Commandoes need time to reload, and they have the power of Hell on their side.
<br />- For the short time that I was taking damage, my plight didn't seem noticeable. I lost 40 points of health in the first 2 minutes and not so much as a grunt was heard from me. There was also nothing to indicate that I was taking damage at all, I just found myself with less health all of a sudden. The effects of taking damage should be more obvious, and I should make some noise when getting hit.
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Good Stuff</span></span>
<br />- Water. The water was cool. My only gripe is that you sink too fast and floating is difficult to accomplish. You should sink slowly, but not too slowly since you have an arsenal of weapons and armor to carry around.
<br />- The weapons look spiffy. I think the firing animation for the Blaster could use improvement though.
<br />- The bodies integrated into the base near the end of Installation were a nice, creepy touch.
<br />- I liked shattering the glass in a lot of places. It was nice to have some destructible elements at hand.
<br /><br />There's not a whole lot more that I can think of, but those are the things I think need work.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107686" date="Posted: Wed Aug 10, 2005 10:44 pm "><author>Kristus</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">heXum wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">-Strogg don't speak english.

<br /><br />Yes, I reacted on this too at first. But then I remembered that all (many atleast) the signs in Quake 2 was in fact in english. So I am quite perplexed on that matter. None of the stroggs actually speak any english. They got their cool Stroggish. But the signs in Q2 read in english, probably because you had to know where the warehouse actually were.

(I'm not counting consol and menu fonts etc) and that's the "Stroggo language" and english. Unfortunately they are very scarce as back in the days of q2, they only mostly 128x128 sized textures, and that let them get away with little red lines portraying as text. :p
<br /><br />But I got screenshots of the two examples. They're not much, but it might be enough to fill your needs.
<br />This is the best example I could find of the Stroggo fontstyle. This one is not that important to get right, since unlike Cyan, id didn't actually invent an entire language. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.darch-angel.com/temporary/stroggofnt.jpg">http://www.darch-angel.com/temporary/stroggofnt.jpg</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />And here's the english font, notice how some of the letters are flipped backwards though.

<br />THis one reminds me of a font called: Mael and another I can't remember what it's called, but it's the one used in this image: &lt;br&gt;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doomworld.com/unholy/island/images/logo.png" class="postlink">Link to an image with a fontstyle in it.</a>
<br /><br />While the other reminds me of one called "Gothic 107" and another called "Ekster 1.00", aswell as "MindFields 1.0" (this one is even hard/impossible to read).
<br /><br />I'm not saying that these fonts are any dead ringers or anything.

I went to open the doors, and when they slid open there was an Enforcer inside, which made absolutely no sense. Consider making the door solid instead, removing the Enforcer, or having the elevator sit in a lowered state by default, so when it comes up, the doors open and the Enforcer steps out to attack.
<br />- It's too dark, though I guess this is mostly the engine's fault. The exit elevator, however, should've had SOME light cast upon it, since it was pitch black. There were other areas like this as well, especially in Installation.
<br />- The Fliers seem to be in a state of perpetual darkness. Maybe it was just the locations I was fighting them, but it seemed to me as if they were under permanent shadow.
<br />- The AI needs work. The enemies seemed capable of shooting forever, which makes life extraordinarily difficult. Even the Z-Sec and Zombie Commandoes need time to reload, and they have the power of Hell on their side.
<br />- For the short time that I was taking damage, my plight didn't seem noticeable. I lost 40 points of health in the first 2 minutes and not so much as a grunt was heard from me. There was also nothing to indicate that I was taking damage at all, I just found myself with less health all of a sudden. The effects of taking damage should be more obvious, and I should make some noise when getting hit.
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Good Stuff</span></span>
<br />- Water. The water was cool. My only gripe is that you sink too fast and floating is difficult to accomplish. You should sink slowly, but not too slowly since you have an arsenal of weapons and armor to carry around.
<br />- The weapons look spiffy. I think the firing animation for the Blaster could use improvement though.
<br />- The bodies integrated into the base near the end of Installation were a nice, creepy touch.
<br />- I liked shattering the glass in a lot of places. It was nice to have some destructible elements at hand.
<br /><br />There's not a whole lot more that I can think of, but those are the things I think need work.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107686" date="Posted: Wed Aug 10, 2005 10:44 pm "><author>Kristus</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">heXum wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">-Strogg don't speak english.

<br /><br />I tested the mod (nice one) &amp; found that the game crashes each time I try to change the video quality. So I'm stuck in a "low" quality (any resolution seems to work), but I can't try "medium" or "high"...
<br /><br />Sys. spec.:
<br />- WinXP SP2
<br />- AthlonXP 2000+
<br />- NVIDIA GeForce4 TI 4600
<br />- 512 (RAM)
<br /><br />Oh, and I tested a logfile (qconsole..), but nothing special appeared on it...
<br /><br />EDIT: I forget to mention that the game crashes only during level loading (I tested both levels...), i.e. if I switch the game quality, everything goes fine (the game restarts,etc...), but if I try to play a level, then the game begins to load ressources &amp; crashes at that point:

<br />- NVIDIA GeForce4 TI 4600
<br /><br />Those right there are definite factors in your performance. Through my testings, SP2 hurts FPS when running DOOM 3. (could differ on other machines however, but it affected it on my dev box)
<br /><br />The TI 4600 isn't a recommended card for D3 itself, though it does run it. I pushed the bar with the engine and mod by using many 2048's so anything less than a GF6800 and 512RAM isn't suggested. I targeted high end systems. GF6800-7800 1024-2048RAM. The mod itself doesn't run poorly, it just requires steeper hardware specs.
<br /><br />Crylar, updgrade D3 to the 1.3 Patch.
<br /><br />SilentSoD, can you show me what misalignments you're talking about. Other than the Chaingun, I know it's not aligned.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107776" date="Posted: Thu Aug 11, 2005 4:50 pm "><author>Sebultura</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Kiltron =&gt; it's really strange, because I've just tested the game in a ultra quality mode (the mad guy that I am lol!) and the level load nice !!!!

My thoughts:
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Bad Stuff</span></span>
<br />- Way, way, WAY too hard IMO. I lost close to 40 health trying to get out of the starting area and into the rest of the base. I cowardly turned on God mode just so I could live to see the rest of the demo. (yes, I know, shame on me <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> )
<br />- Health doesn't do much. I mean, +2 Health, +10 Health? The light shotgunners and machine gunners will take that out with their first shots. Health should really do more, especially given the amount of enemies that one must fight and how much damage they can inflict in a short time period. I can tell already that Gunners are gonna eat thru 100 health like it's nothing, and that's not even with grenades.
<br />- The Fliers seem compelled to get up-close, which I find strange because it makes them an easy target since one shotgun blast kills them. They should probably hang back more and dodge more frequently, since their blasters are more of a menace than anything else.
<br />- A crosshair is definately needed in order to fire true. I wasn't sure what I was hitting, if anything.
<br />- Most of the Light Guards went down smoothly, but sometimes they could take a direct shotgun blast to the head without going down. You may need to adjust their health slightly. Or add the crosshair, as aim may have been off slightly in some cases.
<br />- The marine is missing from the opening sequence. Seriously, I did not see him at all.
<br />- At the end of Outer Base, at the exit elevator, I fired Blaster shots into the elevator to see better. There was nothing in there.

<br /><br />Those right there are definite factors in your performance. Through my testings, SP2 hurts FPS when running DOOM 3. (could differ on other machines however, but it affected it on my dev box)
<br /><br />The TI 4600 isn't a recommended card for D3 itself, though it does run it. I pushed the bar with the engine and mod by using many 2048's so anything less than a GF6800 and 512RAM isn't suggested. I targeted high end systems. GF6800-7800 1024-2048RAM. The mod itself doesn't run poorly, it just requires steeper hardware specs.
<br /><br />Crylar, updgrade D3 to the 1.3 Patch.

My thoughts:
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Bad Stuff</span></span>
<br />- Way, way, WAY too hard IMO. I lost close to 40 health trying to get out of the starting area and into the rest of the base. I cowardly turned on God mode just so I could live to see the rest of the demo. (yes, I know, shame on me <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> )
<br />- Health doesn't do much. I mean, +2 Health, +10 Health? The light shotgunners and machine gunners will take that out with their first shots. Health should really do more, especially given the amount of enemies that one must fight and how much damage they can inflict in a short time period. I can tell already that Gunners are gonna eat thru 100 health like it's nothing, and that's not even with grenades.
<br />- The Fliers seem compelled to get up-close, which I find strange because it makes them an easy target since one shotgun blast kills them. They should probably hang back more and dodge more frequently, since their blasters are more of a menace than anything else.
<br />- A crosshair is definately needed in order to fire true. I wasn't sure what I was hitting, if anything.
<br />- Most of the Light Guards went down smoothly, but sometimes they could take a direct shotgun blast to the head without going down. You may need to adjust their health slightly. Or add the crosshair, as aim may have been off slightly in some cases.
<br />- The marine is missing from the opening sequence. Seriously, I did not see him at all.
<br />- At the end of Outer Base, at the exit elevator, I fired Blaster shots into the elevator to see better. There was nothing in there. I went to open the doors, and when they slid open there was an Enforcer inside, which made absolutely no sense. Consider making the door solid instead, removing the Enforcer, or having the elevator sit in a lowered state by default, so when it comes up, the doors open and the Enforcer steps out to attack.
<br />- It's too dark, though I guess this is mostly the engine's fault. The exit elevator, however, should've had SOME light cast upon it, since it was pitch black. There were other areas like this as well, especially in Installation.
<br />- The Fliers seem to be in a state of perpetual darkness. Maybe it was just the locations I was fighting them, but it seemed to me as if they were under permanent shadow.
<br />- The AI needs work. The enemies seemed capable of shooting forever, which makes life extraordinarily difficult. Even the Z-Sec and Zombie Commandoes need time to reload, and they have the power of Hell on their side.
<br />- For the short time that I was taking damage, my plight didn't seem noticeable. I lost 40 points of health in the first 2 minutes and not so much as a grunt was heard from me. There was also nothing to indicate that I was taking damage at all, I just found myself with less health all of a sudden. The effects of taking damage should be more obvious, and I should make some noise when getting hit.
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Good Stuff</span></span>
<br />- Water. The water was cool. My only gripe is that you sink too fast and floating is difficult to accomplish. You should sink slowly, but not too slowly since you have an arsenal of weapons and armor to carry around.
<br />- The weapons look spiffy. I think the firing animation for the Blaster could use improvement though.
<br />- The bodies integrated into the base near the end of Installation were a nice, creepy touch.
<br />- I liked shattering the glass in a lot of places. It was nice to have some destructible elements at hand.
<br /><br />There's not a whole lot more that I can think of, but those are the things I think need work.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107686" date="Posted: Wed Aug 10, 2005 10:44 pm "><author>Kristus</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">heXum wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">-Strogg don't speak english.

<br /><br />Yes, I reacted on this too at first. But then I remembered that all (many atleast) the signs in Quake 2 was in fact in english. So I am quite perplexed on that matter. None of the stroggs actually speak any english. They got their cool Stroggish. But the signs in Q2 read in english, probably because you had to know where the warehouse actually were.

(I'm not counting consol and menu fonts etc) and that's the "Stroggo language" and english. Unfortunately they are very scarce as back in the days of q2, they only mostly 128x128 sized textures, and that let them get away with little red lines portraying as text. :p
<br /><br />But I got screenshots of the two examples. They're not much, but it might be enough to fill your needs.
<br />This is the best example I could find of the Stroggo fontstyle. This one is not that important to get right, since unlike Cyan, id didn't actually invent an entire language. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.darch-angel.com/temporary/stroggofnt.jpg">http://www.darch-angel.com/temporary/stroggofnt.jpg</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />And here's the english font, notice how some of the letters are flipped backwards though.

<br />THis one reminds me of a font called: Mael and another I can't remember what it's called, but it's the one used in this image: &lt;br&gt;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doomworld.com/unholy/island/images/logo.png" class="postlink">Link to an image with a fontstyle in it.</a>
<br /><br />While the other reminds me of one called "Gothic 107" and another called "Ekster 1.00", aswell as "MindFields 1.0" (this one is even hard/impossible to read).
<br /><br />I'm not saying that these fonts are any dead ringers or anything.

I love this site and the helpful people that post here.  I have been visiting D3W since June '04 and have never posted anything.  Since Q2 is my favorite FPS, I figured my first post should be here.
<br /><br />Anyways, the mod is awesome but the textures really bugged me.  They look like they were taken straight from the Q2 retexturing site.  This wouldn't be a bad thing if they were made with a PPL engine in mind, but they weren't.  The diffuse stages all have shadows painted on them.  What's worse is that they were then run through a Normal Map filter, resulting in normal maps that are not that good.  
<br /><br />From my experince, normal maps look best if you make true bump maps first (or an actual 3d model) and then run that through the filter (preferably in many different stages and then flattened together).
<br /><br />Also, the normal maps should just be the major forms of the texture, ie bricks, panels, planks, etc..  Then use bumpmaps to create the actual imperfections  like weathering, rust, grain, etc.
<br /><br />Hope this helps out, and keep working because I cannot wait to play the full version.

<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Bad Stuff</span></span>
<br />- Way, way, WAY too hard IMO. I lost close to 40 health trying to get out of the starting area and into the rest of the base. I cowardly turned on God mode just so I could live to see the rest of the demo. (yes, I know, shame on me <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> )
<br />- Health doesn't do much. I mean, +2 Health, +10 Health? The light shotgunners and machine gunners will take that out with their first shots. Health should really do more, especially given the amount of enemies that one must fight and how much damage they can inflict in a short time period. I can tell already that Gunners are gonna eat thru 100 health like it's nothing, and that's not even with grenades.
<br />- The Fliers seem compelled to get up-close, which I find strange because it makes them an easy target since one shotgun blast kills them. They should probably hang back more and dodge more frequently, since their blasters are more of a menace than anything else.
<br />- A crosshair is definately needed in order to fire true. I wasn't sure what I was hitting, if anything.
<br />- Most of the Light Guards went down smoothly, but sometimes they could take a direct shotgun blast to the head without going down. You may need to adjust their health slightly. Or add the crosshair, as aim may have been off slightly in some cases.
<br />- The marine is missing from the opening sequence. Seriously, I did not see him at all.
<br />- At the end of Outer Base, at the exit elevator, I fired Blaster shots into the elevator to see better. There was nothing in there. I went to open the doors, and when they slid open there was an Enforcer inside, which made absolutely no sense. Consider making the door solid instead, removing the Enforcer, or having the elevator sit in a lowered state by default, so when it comes up, the doors open and the Enforcer steps out to attack.
<br />- It's too dark, though I guess this is mostly the engine's fault. The exit elevator, however, should've had SOME light cast upon it, since it was pitch black. There were other areas like this as well, especially in Installation.
<br />- The Fliers seem to be in a state of perpetual darkness. Maybe it was just the locations I was fighting them, but it seemed to me as if they were under permanent shadow.
<br />- The AI needs work. The enemies seemed capable of shooting forever, which makes life extraordinarily difficult. Even the Z-Sec and Zombie Commandoes need time to reload, and they have the power of Hell on their side.
<br />- For the short time that I was taking damage, my plight didn't seem noticeable. I lost 40 points of health in the first 2 minutes and not so much as a grunt was heard from me. There was also nothing to indicate that I was taking damage at all, I just found myself with less health all of a sudden. The effects of taking damage should be more obvious, and I should make some noise when getting hit.
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Good Stuff</span></span>
<br />- Water. The water was cool. My only gripe is that you sink too fast and floating is difficult to accomplish. You should sink slowly, but not too slowly since you have an arsenal of weapons and armor to carry around.
<br />- The weapons look spiffy. I think the firing animation for the Blaster could use improvement though.
<br />- The bodies integrated into the base near the end of Installation were a nice, creepy touch.
<br />- I liked shattering the glass in a lot of places. It was nice to have some destructible elements at hand.
<br /><br />There's not a whole lot more that I can think of, but those are the things I think need work.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107686" date="Posted: Wed Aug 10, 2005 10:44 pm "><author>Kristus</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">heXum wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">-Strogg don't speak english.

<br /><br />Those right there are definite factors in your performance. Through my testings, SP2 hurts FPS when running DOOM 3. (could differ on other machines however, but it affected it on my dev box)
<br /><br />The TI 4600 isn't a recommended card for D3 itself, though it does run it. I pushed the bar with the engine and mod by using many 2048's so anything less than a GF6800 and 512RAM isn't suggested. I targeted high end systems. GF6800-7800 1024-2048RAM. The mod itself doesn't run poorly, it just requires steeper hardware specs.
<br /><br />Crylar, updgrade D3 to the 1.3 Patch.

My thoughts:
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Bad Stuff</span></span>
<br />- Way, way, WAY too hard IMO. I lost close to 40 health trying to get out of the starting area and into the rest of the base. I cowardly turned on God mode just so I could live to see the rest of the demo. (yes, I know, shame on me <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> )
<br />- Health doesn't do much. I mean, +2 Health, +10 Health? The light shotgunners and machine gunners will take that out with their first shots. Health should really do more, especially given the amount of enemies that one must fight and how much damage they can inflict in a short time period. I can tell already that Gunners are gonna eat thru 100 health like it's nothing, and that's not even with grenades.
<br />- The Fliers seem compelled to get up-close, which I find strange because it makes them an easy target since one shotgun blast kills them. They should probably hang back more and dodge more frequently, since their blasters are more of a menace than anything else.
<br />- A crosshair is definately needed in order to fire true. I wasn't sure what I was hitting, if anything.
<br />- Most of the Light Guards went down smoothly, but sometimes they could take a direct shotgun blast to the head without going down. You may need to adjust their health slightly. Or add the crosshair, as aim may have been off slightly in some cases.
<br />- The marine is missing from the opening sequence. Seriously, I did not see him at all.
<br />- At the end of Outer Base, at the exit elevator, I fired Blaster shots into the elevator to see better. There was nothing in there. I went to open the doors, and when they slid open there was an Enforcer inside, which made absolutely no sense. Consider making the door solid instead, removing the Enforcer, or having the elevator sit in a lowered state by default, so when it comes up, the doors open and the Enforcer steps out to attack.
<br />- It's too dark, though I guess this is mostly the engine's fault. The exit elevator, however, should've had SOME light cast upon it, since it was pitch black. There were other areas like this as well, especially in Installation.
<br />- The Fliers seem to be in a state of perpetual darkness. Maybe it was just the locations I was fighting them, but it seemed to me as if they were under permanent shadow.
<br />- The AI needs work. The enemies seemed capable of shooting forever, which makes life extraordinarily difficult. Even the Z-Sec and Zombie Commandoes need time to reload, and they have the power of Hell on their side.
<br />- For the short time that I was taking damage, my plight didn't seem noticeable. I lost 40 points of health in the first 2 minutes and not so much as a grunt was heard from me. There was also nothing to indicate that I was taking damage at all, I just found myself with less health all of a sudden. The effects of taking damage should be more obvious, and I should make some noise when getting hit.
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Good Stuff</span></span>
<br />- Water. The water was cool. My only gripe is that you sink too fast and floating is difficult to accomplish. You should sink slowly, but not too slowly since you have an arsenal of weapons and armor to carry around.
<br />- The weapons look spiffy. I think the firing animation for the Blaster could use improvement though.
<br />- The bodies integrated into the base near the end of Installation were a nice, creepy touch.
<br />- I liked shattering the glass in a lot of places. It was nice to have some destructible elements at hand.
<br /><br />There's not a whole lot more that I can think of, but those are the things I think need work.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107686" date="Posted: Wed Aug 10, 2005 10:44 pm "><author>Kristus</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">heXum wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">-Strogg don't speak english.

<br /><br />Yes, I reacted on this too at first. But then I remembered that all (many atleast) the signs in Quake 2 was in fact in english. So I am quite perplexed on that matter. None of the stroggs actually speak any english. They got their cool Stroggish. But the signs in Q2 read in english, probably because you had to know where the warehouse actually were.

(I'm not counting consol and menu fonts etc) and that's the "Stroggo language" and english. Unfortunately they are very scarce as back in the days of q2, they only mostly 128x128 sized textures, and that let them get away with little red lines portraying as text. :p
<br /><br />But I got screenshots of the two examples. They're not much, but it might be enough to fill your needs.
<br />This is the best example I could find of the Stroggo fontstyle. This one is not that important to get right, since unlike Cyan, id didn't actually invent an entire language. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.darch-angel.com/temporary/stroggofnt.jpg">http://www.darch-angel.com/temporary/stroggofnt.jpg</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />And here's the english font, notice how some of the letters are flipped backwards though.

<br />THis one reminds me of a font called: Mael and another I can't remember what it's called, but it's the one used in this image: &lt;br&gt;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doomworld.com/unholy/island/images/logo.png" class="postlink">Link to an image with a fontstyle in it.</a>
<br /><br />While the other reminds me of one called "Gothic 107" and another called "Ekster 1.00", aswell as "MindFields 1.0" (this one is even hard/impossible to read).
<br /><br />I'm not saying that these fonts are any dead ringers or anything.

I love this site and the helpful people that post here.  I have been visiting D3W since June '04 and have never posted anything.  Since Q2 is my favorite FPS, I figured my first post should be here.
<br /><br />Anyways, the mod is awesome but the textures really bugged me.  They look like they were taken straight from the Q2 retexturing site.  This wouldn't be a bad thing if they were made with a PPL engine in mind, but they weren't.  The diffuse stages all have shadows painted on them.  What's worse is that they were then run through a Normal Map filter, resulting in normal maps that are not that good.  
<br /><br />From my experince, normal maps look best if you make true bump maps first (or an actual 3d model) and then run that through the filter (preferably in many different stages and then flattened together).

<br />- It's too dark, though I guess this is mostly the engine's fault. The exit elevator, however, should've had SOME light cast upon it, since it was pitch black. There were other areas like this as well, especially in Installation.
<br />- The Fliers seem to be in a state of perpetual darkness. Maybe it was just the locations I was fighting them, but it seemed to me as if they were under permanent shadow.
<br />- The AI needs work. The enemies seemed capable of shooting forever, which makes life extraordinarily difficult. Even the Z-Sec and Zombie Commandoes need time to reload, and they have the power of Hell on their side.
<br />- For the short time that I was taking damage, my plight didn't seem noticeable. I lost 40 points of health in the first 2 minutes and not so much as a grunt was heard from me. There was also nothing to indicate that I was taking damage at all, I just found myself with less health all of a sudden. The effects of taking damage should be more obvious, and I should make some noise when getting hit.
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Good Stuff</span></span>
<br />- Water. The water was cool. My only gripe is that you sink too fast and floating is difficult to accomplish. You should sink slowly, but not too slowly since you have an arsenal of weapons and armor to carry around.
<br />- The weapons look spiffy. I think the firing animation for the Blaster could use improvement though.
<br />- The bodies integrated into the base near the end of Installation were a nice, creepy touch.
<br />- I liked shattering the glass in a lot of places. It was nice to have some destructible elements at hand.
<br /><br />There's not a whole lot more that I can think of, but those are the things I think need work.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107686" date="Posted: Wed Aug 10, 2005 10:44 pm "><author>Kristus</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">heXum wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">-Strogg don't speak english.

<br /><br />I tested the mod (nice one) &amp; found that the game crashes each time I try to change the video quality. So I'm stuck in a "low" quality (any resolution seems to work), but I can't try "medium" or "high"...
<br /><br />Sys. spec.:
<br />- WinXP SP2
<br />- AthlonXP 2000+
<br />- NVIDIA GeForce4 TI 4600
<br />- 512 (RAM)
<br /><br />Oh, and I tested a logfile (qconsole..), but nothing special appeared on it...
<br /><br />EDIT: I forget to mention that the game crashes only during level loading (I tested both levels...), i.e. if I switch the game quality, everything goes fine (the game restarts,etc...), but if I try to play a level, then the game begins to load ressources &amp; crashes at that point:

<br />- NVIDIA GeForce4 TI 4600
<br /><br />Those right there are definite factors in your performance. Through my testings, SP2 hurts FPS when running DOOM 3. (could differ on other machines however, but it affected it on my dev box)
<br /><br />The TI 4600 isn't a recommended card for D3 itself, though it does run it. I pushed the bar with the engine and mod by using many 2048's so anything less than a GF6800 and 512RAM isn't suggested. I targeted high end systems. GF6800-7800 1024-2048RAM. The mod itself doesn't run poorly, it just requires steeper hardware specs.
<br /><br />Crylar, updgrade D3 to the 1.3 Patch.
<br /><br />SilentSoD, can you show me what misalignments you're talking about. Other than the Chaingun, I know it's not aligned.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107776" date="Posted: Thu Aug 11, 2005 4:50 pm "><author>Sebultura</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Kiltron =&gt; it's really strange, because I've just tested the game in a ultra quality mode (the mad guy that I am lol!) and the level load nice !!!!

My thoughts:
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Bad Stuff</span></span>
<br />- Way, way, WAY too hard IMO. I lost close to 40 health trying to get out of the starting area and into the rest of the base. I cowardly turned on God mode just so I could live to see the rest of the demo. (yes, I know, shame on me <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> )
<br />- Health doesn't do much. I mean, +2 Health, +10 Health? The light shotgunners and machine gunners will take that out with their first shots. Health should really do more, especially given the amount of enemies that one must fight and how much damage they can inflict in a short time period. I can tell already that Gunners are gonna eat thru 100 health like it's nothing, and that's not even with grenades.
<br />- The Fliers seem compelled to get up-close, which I find strange because it makes them an easy target since one shotgun blast kills them. They should probably hang back more and dodge more frequently, since their blasters are more of a menace than anything else.
<br />- A crosshair is definately needed in order to fire true. I wasn't sure what I was hitting, if anything.
<br />- Most of the Light Guards went down smoothly, but sometimes they could take a direct shotgun blast to the head without going down. You may need to adjust their health slightly. Or add the crosshair, as aim may have been off slightly in some cases.
<br />- The marine is missing from the opening sequence. Seriously, I did not see him at all.
<br />- At the end of Outer Base, at the exit elevator, I fired Blaster shots into the elevator to see better. There was nothing in there. I went to open the doors, and when they slid open there was an Enforcer inside, which made absolutely no sense. Consider making the door solid instead, removing the Enforcer, or having the elevator sit in a lowered state by default, so when it comes up, the doors open and the Enforcer steps out to attack.

<br /><br />I tested the mod (nice one) &amp; found that the game crashes each time I try to change the video quality. So I'm stuck in a "low" quality (any resolution seems to work), but I can't try "medium" or "high"...
<br /><br />Sys. spec.:
<br />- WinXP SP2
<br />- AthlonXP 2000+
<br />- NVIDIA GeForce4 TI 4600
<br />- 512 (RAM)
<br /><br />Oh, and I tested a logfile (qconsole..), but nothing special appeared on it...
<br /><br />EDIT: I forget to mention that the game crashes only during level loading (I tested both levels...), i.e. if I switch the game quality, everything goes fine (the game restarts,etc...), but if I try to play a level, then the game begins to load ressources &amp; crashes at that point:

<br /><br />Those right there are definite factors in your performance. Through my testings, SP2 hurts FPS when running DOOM 3. (could differ on other machines however, but it affected it on my dev box)
<br /><br />The TI 4600 isn't a recommended card for D3 itself, though it does run it. I pushed the bar with the engine and mod by using many 2048's so anything less than a GF6800 and 512RAM isn't suggested. I targeted high end systems. GF6800-7800 1024-2048RAM. The mod itself doesn't run poorly, it just requires steeper hardware specs.
<br /><br />Crylar, updgrade D3 to the 1.3 Patch.
<br /><br />SilentSoD, can you show me what misalignments you're talking about. Other than the Chaingun, I know it's not aligned.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107776" date="Posted: Thu Aug 11, 2005 4:50 pm "><author>Sebultura</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Kiltron =&gt; it's really strange, because I've just tested the game in a ultra quality mode (the mad guy that I am lol!) and the level load nice !!!!

When the action is being pumped backwards the hand pulls the forearm away from the gun, resulting in a small, but noticeable, error.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img292.imageshack.us/my.php?image=shot000038lv.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img292.imageshack.us/img292/2669/shot000038lv.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />As for the alignment issues, it may be a matter of preference to particular players, I can't speak for anyone else, but in my opinion the shotgun feels most "right" in terms of how it is aligned, I have the easiest time aiming with it without a crosshair. In opposition to this the supershotgun draws a line farther to the left and considerably lower than the shotgun. I have spliced a picture of the shotgun and supershotgun together to demonstrate this.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img362.imageshack.us/my.php?image=splice6la.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img362.imageshack.us/img362/5333/splice6la.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />The machine gun has the same issue as the supershotgun, perhaps its not so much poor alignment as inconsistency which is making this so noticeable to me. If I weren't lazy I'd post pictures of the DooM 3 weapons.

If you would be so kind could you tell me whether or not what I'm doing, editing your mod, is welcome or not? In the meantime, I'm going to see if I can change D3's shotgun script to make it yet more to my liking (I'm very new to all this and the earlier mod to the D3 shotgun script and def file actually worked so I'm going to see if this new idea does as well).</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107895" date="Posted: Fri Aug 12, 2005 12:54 pm "><author>Crylar</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Kiltron wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">- WinXP SP2<br />- NVIDIA GeForce4 TI 4600<br />...<br />The TI 4600 isn't a recommended card for D3 itself, though it does run it.

Kiltron's site doesn't have a forum for discussing problems.
<br /><br />I'm really anxious to play this, but it is just soooooooo choppy, I can't do anything. There are parts where it runs ok, like underneath in the crawl space in the first level. But anytime there's anything special on screen it runs at less than 1 fps. By the time I "wake up" from the choppyness I'm either dead or nearly dead from enemies. Anytime there's an enemy on the screen especially it's just crawling! 
<br /><br />I'm very intersted to know if anyone else is having the same problem. Doom 3 runs smooth as silk on my computer. Every game I run does. I even set the specs as low as I could get them and it still just crawled along. I couldn't get past the first level.

The Wrong .dll API issue is that problem. Trying to run 1.3 gamecode with a 1.2 installation won't work.
<br /><br />The slowdowns people are getting from characters on screen is because this test release is aimed to test pushing characters using 2048x2048 texture maps down the pipe. That's why I say using a GeForce 6800 or equivalent or higher is recommended. That is D3's recommended card, and we're pushing just a little bit further using those texture sizes. This isn't on all surfaces, just the characters.

<br /><br />I did the last but after you jumped in the water there is no way of returning. This wouldn't be a problem but the door leading back to the beginning is locked [the one with the turret operation panel next to it]. Since I wasn't able to deactive the red lasers I figured I must have missed something, but after some searching it appeared the only way of getting back to the beginning was using "Noclip" to get through the door.
<br /><br />I didn't find anything special so how do you put the red lasers of ? I eventually used God mode to get through and I hate cheating.
<br /><br />Also the site mentions that the mod wouldn't be a clone, but this sure as hell looks and plays a lot like Quake 2 to me.

<br /><br /><br />To turn off the lasers, when you reach the "water room" swim as far to the right as you can, go underwater, look around for a bit. There will be a room with lasers and a path around them to a control panel where you can turn off the lasers.

						<div class="postbody">Kiltron, hope you don't mind but I'm going to start this post with another error I saw, this time in the supershotgun pump animation. When the action is being pumped backwards the hand pulls the forearm away from the gun, resulting in a small, but noticeable, error.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img292.imageshack.us/my.php?image=shot000038lv.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img292.imageshack.us/img292/2669/shot000038lv.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />As for the alignment issues, it may be a matter of preference to particular players, I can't speak for anyone else, but in my opinion the shotgun feels most "right" in terms of how it is aligned, I have the easiest time aiming with it without a crosshair. In opposition to this the supershotgun draws a line farther to the left and considerably lower than the shotgun. I have spliced a picture of the shotgun and supershotgun together to demonstrate this.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img362.imageshack.us/my.php?image=splice6la.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img362.imageshack.us/img362/5333/splice6la.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />The machine gun has the same issue as the supershotgun, perhaps its not so much poor alignment as inconsistency which is making this so noticeable to me. If I weren't lazy I'd post pictures of the DooM 3 weapons.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img361.imageshack.us/my.php?image=splice27bx.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img361.imageshack.us/img361/8310/splice27bx.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />Hope this helps, I had a great time playing through this first test build. Thanks for your time and work.
<br /><br />Edited because I forget to remove particular words when I change grammar and thus sentences read oddly.</div>

						<div class="postbody">I also just made a new pk4 to see what a decent damage would be for the shotgun, don't think I'm going to mess with the other weapons right now. Setting the damage to ten allows for mostly one shot kills against the light guards and also seems to speed up gameplay. This really is just personal preference, however, and can be ignored at will. If you would be so kind could you tell me whether or not what I'm doing, editing your mod, is welcome or not? In the meantime, I'm going to see if I can change D3's shotgun script to make it yet more to my liking (I'm very new to all this and the earlier mod to the D3 shotgun script and def file actually worked so I'm going to see if this new idea does as well).</div>

						<div class="postbody">Ahh, I didn't see this forum about the mod. Kiltron's site doesn't have a forum for discussing problems.
<br /><br />I'm really anxious to play this, but it is just soooooooo choppy, I can't do anything. There are parts where it runs ok, like underneath in the crawl space in the first level. But anytime there's anything special on screen it runs at less than 1 fps. By the time I "wake up" from the choppyness I'm either dead or nearly dead from enemies. Anytime there's an enemy on the screen especially it's just crawling! 
<br /><br />I'm very intersted to know if anyone else is having the same problem. Doom 3 runs smooth as silk on my computer. Every game I run does. I even set the specs as low as I could get them and it still just crawled along. I couldn't get past the first level.
<br /><br />My PC is:
<br />P4 2.0 gig
<br />1 gig ram
<br />GeForce fx 5900 128 megs ram</div>

						<div class="postbody">Crylar, the only possible explanation is you don't have D3 patched properly to 1.3. The Wrong .dll API issue is that problem. Trying to run 1.3 gamecode with a 1.2 installation won't work.
<br /><br />The slowdowns people are getting from characters on screen is because this test release is aimed to test pushing characters using 2048x2048 texture maps down the pipe. That's why I say using a GeForce 6800 or equivalent or higher is recommended. That is D3's recommended card, and we're pushing just a little bit further using those texture sizes. This isn't on all surfaces, just the characters.
<br /><br />GeForce fx 5900 128 megs ram
<br /><br />That's not really going to perform well. Nothing against your card, but that's just how the mod is.</div>

						<div class="postbody">Maybe it's because it's late and I'm tired. Or maybe I'm just stupid but when you start in the first map, you can take two routes. Crawling beneath the rock to get to the broken elevator room or shoot the window and crawl down to end up in the water room. 
<br /><br />I did the last but after you jumped in the water there is no way of returning. This wouldn't be a problem but the door leading back to the beginning is locked [the one with the turret operation panel next to it]. Since I wasn't able to deactive the red lasers I figured I must have missed something, but after some searching it appeared the only way of getting back to the beginning was using "Noclip" to get through the door.
<br /><br />I didn't find anything special so how do you put the red lasers of ? I eventually used God mode to get through and I hate cheating.
<br /><br />Also the site mentions that the mod wouldn't be a clone, but this sure as hell looks and plays a lot like Quake 2 to me. I'd hoped to see brand new levels <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></div>

						<div class="postbody">Well it seems as though I've tracked down the source of my massive slowdowns. My video card's fan took a dump on me and I nearly burned up my card. Luckily I tracked down the problem soon enough and I've been able to keep it cool with a mini fan until I get ahold of the manufacturer to find out if it's covered under warrantee. My Trackmania is playing again, and this mod plays just fine. There's some choppyness to it, but that'll get hammered out by final release i'm sure.</div>

When the action is being pumped backwards the hand pulls the forearm away from the gun, resulting in a small, but noticeable, error.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img292.imageshack.us/my.php?image=shot000038lv.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img292.imageshack.us/img292/2669/shot000038lv.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />As for the alignment issues, it may be a matter of preference to particular players, I can't speak for anyone else, but in my opinion the shotgun feels most "right" in terms of how it is aligned, I have the easiest time aiming with it without a crosshair. In opposition to this the supershotgun draws a line farther to the left and considerably lower than the shotgun. I have spliced a picture of the shotgun and supershotgun together to demonstrate this.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img362.imageshack.us/my.php?image=splice6la.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img362.imageshack.us/img362/5333/splice6la.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />The machine gun has the same issue as the supershotgun, perhaps its not so much poor alignment as inconsistency which is making this so noticeable to me. If I weren't lazy I'd post pictures of the DooM 3 weapons.

<br /><br />Hope this helps, I had a great time playing through this first test build. Thanks for your time and work.

Setting the damage to ten allows for mostly one shot kills against the light guards and also seems to speed up gameplay. This really is just personal preference, however, and can be ignored at will. If you would be so kind could you tell me whether or not what I'm doing, editing your mod, is welcome or not? In the meantime, I'm going to see if I can change D3's shotgun script to make it yet more to my liking (I'm very new to all this and the earlier mod to the D3 shotgun script and def file actually worked so I'm going to see if this new idea does as well).</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107895" date="Posted: Fri Aug 12, 2005 12:54 pm "><author>Crylar</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Kiltron wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">- WinXP SP2<br />- NVIDIA GeForce4 TI 4600<br />...<br />The TI 4600 isn't a recommended card for D3 itself, though it does run it.

Kiltron's site doesn't have a forum for discussing problems.
<br /><br />I'm really anxious to play this, but it is just soooooooo choppy, I can't do anything. There are parts where it runs ok, like underneath in the crawl space in the first level. But anytime there's anything special on screen it runs at less than 1 fps. By the time I "wake up" from the choppyness I'm either dead or nearly dead from enemies. Anytime there's an enemy on the screen especially it's just crawling! 
<br /><br />I'm very intersted to know if anyone else is having the same problem. Doom 3 runs smooth as silk on my computer. Every game I run does. I even set the specs as low as I could get them and it still just crawled along. I couldn't get past the first level.

The Wrong .dll API issue is that problem. Trying to run 1.3 gamecode with a 1.2 installation won't work.
<br /><br />The slowdowns people are getting from characters on screen is because this test release is aimed to test pushing characters using 2048x2048 texture maps down the pipe. That's why I say using a GeForce 6800 or equivalent or higher is recommended. That is D3's recommended card, and we're pushing just a little bit further using those texture sizes. This isn't on all surfaces, just the characters.
<br /><br />GeForce fx 5900 128 megs ram
<br /><br />That's not really going to perform well. Nothing against your card, but that's just how the mod is.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107961" date="Posted: Fri Aug 12, 2005 9:17 pm "><author>Infernis</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">What about my problems Kiltron ?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107987" date="Posted: Sat Aug 13, 2005 12:51 am "><author>Kiltron</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">TheJugglah, can you post a copy of the console text that is printing when you get that error?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107991" date="Posted: Sat Aug 13, 2005 1:33 am "><author>SonicClang</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Kiltron, any plans on getting a lower poly version for people like me? ya know... the majority of people playing Doom 3.

Or maybe I'm just stupid but when you start in the first map, you can take two routes. Crawling beneath the rock to get to the broken elevator room or shoot the window and crawl down to end up in the water room. 
<br /><br />I did the last but after you jumped in the water there is no way of returning. This wouldn't be a problem but the door leading back to the beginning is locked [the one with the turret operation panel next to it]. Since I wasn't able to deactive the red lasers I figured I must have missed something, but after some searching it appeared the only way of getting back to the beginning was using "Noclip" to get through the door.
<br /><br />I didn't find anything special so how do you put the red lasers of ? I eventually used God mode to get through and I hate cheating.
<br /><br />Also the site mentions that the mod wouldn't be a clone, but this sure as hell looks and plays a lot like Quake 2 to me. I'd hoped to see brand new levels <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p108089" date="Posted: Sat Aug 13, 2005 10:42 pm "><author>SilentSoD</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">*Spoilers*
<br /><br /><br />To turn off the lasers, when you reach the "water room" swim as far to the right as you can, go underwater, look around for a bit. There will be a room with lasers and a path around them to a control panel where you can turn off the lasers.
<br /><br />There's an easter egg in the room as well.

<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img292.imageshack.us/my.php?image=shot000038lv.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img292.imageshack.us/img292/2669/shot000038lv.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />As for the alignment issues, it may be a matter of preference to particular players, I can't speak for anyone else, but in my opinion the shotgun feels most "right" in terms of how it is aligned, I have the easiest time aiming with it without a crosshair. In opposition to this the supershotgun draws a line farther to the left and considerably lower than the shotgun. I have spliced a picture of the shotgun and supershotgun together to demonstrate this.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img362.imageshack.us/my.php?image=splice6la.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img362.imageshack.us/img362/5333/splice6la.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />The machine gun has the same issue as the supershotgun, perhaps its not so much poor alignment as inconsistency which is making this so noticeable to me. If I weren't lazy I'd post pictures of the DooM 3 weapons.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img361.imageshack.us/my.php?image=splice27bx.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img361.imageshack.us/img361/8310/splice27bx.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />Hope this helps, I had a great time playing through this first test build. Thanks for your time and work.
<br /><br />Edited because I forget to remove particular words when I change grammar and thus sentences read oddly.</div>

						<div class="postbody">I also just made a new pk4 to see what a decent damage would be for the shotgun, don't think I'm going to mess with the other weapons right now. Setting the damage to ten allows for mostly one shot kills against the light guards and also seems to speed up gameplay. This really is just personal preference, however, and can be ignored at will. If you would be so kind could you tell me whether or not what I'm doing, editing your mod, is welcome or not? In the meantime, I'm going to see if I can change D3's shotgun script to make it yet more to my liking (I'm very new to all this and the earlier mod to the D3 shotgun script and def file actually worked so I'm going to see if this new idea does as well).</div>

						<div class="postbody">Ahh, I didn't see this forum about the mod. Kiltron's site doesn't have a forum for discussing problems.
<br /><br />I'm really anxious to play this, but it is just soooooooo choppy, I can't do anything. There are parts where it runs ok, like underneath in the crawl space in the first level. But anytime there's anything special on screen it runs at less than 1 fps. By the time I "wake up" from the choppyness I'm either dead or nearly dead from enemies. Anytime there's an enemy on the screen especially it's just crawling! 
<br /><br />I'm very intersted to know if anyone else is having the same problem. Doom 3 runs smooth as silk on my computer. Every game I run does. I even set the specs as low as I could get them and it still just crawled along. I couldn't get past the first level.
<br /><br />My PC is:
<br />P4 2.0 gig
<br />1 gig ram
<br />GeForce fx 5900 128 megs ram</div>

						<div class="postbody">Crylar, the only possible explanation is you don't have D3 patched properly to 1.3. The Wrong .dll API issue is that problem. Trying to run 1.3 gamecode with a 1.2 installation won't work.
<br /><br />The slowdowns people are getting from characters on screen is because this test release is aimed to test pushing characters using 2048x2048 texture maps down the pipe. That's why I say using a GeForce 6800 or equivalent or higher is recommended. That is D3's recommended card, and we're pushing just a little bit further using those texture sizes. This isn't on all surfaces, just the characters.

						<div class="postbody">Maybe it's because it's late and I'm tired. Or maybe I'm just stupid but when you start in the first map, you can take two routes. Crawling beneath the rock to get to the broken elevator room or shoot the window and crawl down to end up in the water room. 
<br /><br />I did the last but after you jumped in the water there is no way of returning. This wouldn't be a problem but the door leading back to the beginning is locked [the one with the turret operation panel next to it]. Since I wasn't able to deactive the red lasers I figured I must have missed something, but after some searching it appeared the only way of getting back to the beginning was using "Noclip" to get through the door.
<br /><br />I didn't find anything special so how do you put the red lasers of ? I eventually used God mode to get through and I hate cheating.
<br /><br />Also the site mentions that the mod wouldn't be a clone, but this sure as hell looks and plays a lot like Quake 2 to me. I'd hoped to see brand new levels <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></div>

						<div class="postbody">Well it seems as though I've tracked down the source of my massive slowdowns. My video card's fan took a dump on me and I nearly burned up my card. Luckily I tracked down the problem soon enough and I've been able to keep it cool with a mini fan until I get ahold of the manufacturer to find out if it's covered under warrantee. My Trackmania is playing again, and this mod plays just fine. There's some choppyness to it, but that'll get hammered out by final release i'm sure.</div>

When the action is being pumped backwards the hand pulls the forearm away from the gun, resulting in a small, but noticeable, error.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img292.imageshack.us/my.php?image=shot000038lv.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img292.imageshack.us/img292/2669/shot000038lv.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />As for the alignment issues, it may be a matter of preference to particular players, I can't speak for anyone else, but in my opinion the shotgun feels most "right" in terms of how it is aligned, I have the easiest time aiming with it without a crosshair. In opposition to this the supershotgun draws a line farther to the left and considerably lower than the shotgun. I have spliced a picture of the shotgun and supershotgun together to demonstrate this.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img362.imageshack.us/my.php?image=splice6la.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img362.imageshack.us/img362/5333/splice6la.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />The machine gun has the same issue as the supershotgun, perhaps its not so much poor alignment as inconsistency which is making this so noticeable to me. If I weren't lazy I'd post pictures of the DooM 3 weapons.

If you would be so kind could you tell me whether or not what I'm doing, editing your mod, is welcome or not? In the meantime, I'm going to see if I can change D3's shotgun script to make it yet more to my liking (I'm very new to all this and the earlier mod to the D3 shotgun script and def file actually worked so I'm going to see if this new idea does as well).</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107895" date="Posted: Fri Aug 12, 2005 12:54 pm "><author>Crylar</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Kiltron wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">- WinXP SP2<br />- NVIDIA GeForce4 TI 4600<br />...<br />The TI 4600 isn't a recommended card for D3 itself, though it does run it.

Kiltron's site doesn't have a forum for discussing problems.
<br /><br />I'm really anxious to play this, but it is just soooooooo choppy, I can't do anything. There are parts where it runs ok, like underneath in the crawl space in the first level. But anytime there's anything special on screen it runs at less than 1 fps. By the time I "wake up" from the choppyness I'm either dead or nearly dead from enemies. Anytime there's an enemy on the screen especially it's just crawling! 
<br /><br />I'm very intersted to know if anyone else is having the same problem. Doom 3 runs smooth as silk on my computer. Every game I run does. I even set the specs as low as I could get them and it still just crawled along. I couldn't get past the first level.

The Wrong .dll API issue is that problem. Trying to run 1.3 gamecode with a 1.2 installation won't work.
<br /><br />The slowdowns people are getting from characters on screen is because this test release is aimed to test pushing characters using 2048x2048 texture maps down the pipe. That's why I say using a GeForce 6800 or equivalent or higher is recommended. That is D3's recommended card, and we're pushing just a little bit further using those texture sizes. This isn't on all surfaces, just the characters.

Or maybe I'm just stupid but when you start in the first map, you can take two routes. Crawling beneath the rock to get to the broken elevator room or shoot the window and crawl down to end up in the water room. 
<br /><br />I did the last but after you jumped in the water there is no way of returning. This wouldn't be a problem but the door leading back to the beginning is locked [the one with the turret operation panel next to it]. Since I wasn't able to deactive the red lasers I figured I must have missed something, but after some searching it appeared the only way of getting back to the beginning was using "Noclip" to get through the door.
<br /><br />I didn't find anything special so how do you put the red lasers of ? I eventually used God mode to get through and I hate cheating.
<br /><br />Also the site mentions that the mod wouldn't be a clone, but this sure as hell looks and plays a lot like Quake 2 to me. I'd hoped to see brand new levels <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p108089" date="Posted: Sat Aug 13, 2005 10:42 pm "><author>SilentSoD</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">*Spoilers*
<br /><br /><br />To turn off the lasers, when you reach the "water room" swim as far to the right as you can, go underwater, look around for a bit. There will be a room with lasers and a path around them to a control panel where you can turn off the lasers.
<br /><br />There's an easter egg in the room as well.

						<div class="postbody">Kiltron, hope you don't mind but I'm going to start this post with another error I saw, this time in the supershotgun pump animation. When the action is being pumped backwards the hand pulls the forearm away from the gun, resulting in a small, but noticeable, error.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img292.imageshack.us/my.php?image=shot000038lv.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img292.imageshack.us/img292/2669/shot000038lv.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />As for the alignment issues, it may be a matter of preference to particular players, I can't speak for anyone else, but in my opinion the shotgun feels most "right" in terms of how it is aligned, I have the easiest time aiming with it without a crosshair. In opposition to this the supershotgun draws a line farther to the left and considerably lower than the shotgun. I have spliced a picture of the shotgun and supershotgun together to demonstrate this.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img362.imageshack.us/my.php?image=splice6la.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img362.imageshack.us/img362/5333/splice6la.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />The machine gun has the same issue as the supershotgun, perhaps its not so much poor alignment as inconsistency which is making this so noticeable to me. If I weren't lazy I'd post pictures of the DooM 3 weapons.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img361.imageshack.us/my.php?image=splice27bx.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img361.imageshack.us/img361/8310/splice27bx.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />Hope this helps, I had a great time playing through this first test build. Thanks for your time and work.
<br /><br />Edited because I forget to remove particular words when I change grammar and thus sentences read oddly.</div>

						<div class="postbody">I also just made a new pk4 to see what a decent damage would be for the shotgun, don't think I'm going to mess with the other weapons right now. Setting the damage to ten allows for mostly one shot kills against the light guards and also seems to speed up gameplay. This really is just personal preference, however, and can be ignored at will. If you would be so kind could you tell me whether or not what I'm doing, editing your mod, is welcome or not? In the meantime, I'm going to see if I can change D3's shotgun script to make it yet more to my liking (I'm very new to all this and the earlier mod to the D3 shotgun script and def file actually worked so I'm going to see if this new idea does as well).</div>

						<div class="postbody">Ahh, I didn't see this forum about the mod. Kiltron's site doesn't have a forum for discussing problems.
<br /><br />I'm really anxious to play this, but it is just soooooooo choppy, I can't do anything. There are parts where it runs ok, like underneath in the crawl space in the first level. But anytime there's anything special on screen it runs at less than 1 fps. By the time I "wake up" from the choppyness I'm either dead or nearly dead from enemies. Anytime there's an enemy on the screen especially it's just crawling! 
<br /><br />I'm very intersted to know if anyone else is having the same problem. Doom 3 runs smooth as silk on my computer. Every game I run does. I even set the specs as low as I could get them and it still just crawled along. I couldn't get past the first level.
<br /><br />My PC is:
<br />P4 2.0 gig
<br />1 gig ram
<br />GeForce fx 5900 128 megs ram</div>

						<div class="postbody">Crylar, the only possible explanation is you don't have D3 patched properly to 1.3. The Wrong .dll API issue is that problem. Trying to run 1.3 gamecode with a 1.2 installation won't work.
<br /><br />The slowdowns people are getting from characters on screen is because this test release is aimed to test pushing characters using 2048x2048 texture maps down the pipe. That's why I say using a GeForce 6800 or equivalent or higher is recommended. That is D3's recommended card, and we're pushing just a little bit further using those texture sizes. This isn't on all surfaces, just the characters.
<br /><br />GeForce fx 5900 128 megs ram
<br /><br />That's not really going to perform well. Nothing against your card, but that's just how the mod is.</div>

						<div class="postbody">Maybe it's because it's late and I'm tired. Or maybe I'm just stupid but when you start in the first map, you can take two routes. Crawling beneath the rock to get to the broken elevator room or shoot the window and crawl down to end up in the water room. 
<br /><br />I did the last but after you jumped in the water there is no way of returning. This wouldn't be a problem but the door leading back to the beginning is locked [the one with the turret operation panel next to it]. Since I wasn't able to deactive the red lasers I figured I must have missed something, but after some searching it appeared the only way of getting back to the beginning was using "Noclip" to get through the door.
<br /><br />I didn't find anything special so how do you put the red lasers of ? I eventually used God mode to get through and I hate cheating.
<br /><br />Also the site mentions that the mod wouldn't be a clone, but this sure as hell looks and plays a lot like Quake 2 to me. I'd hoped to see brand new levels <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></div>

When the action is being pumped backwards the hand pulls the forearm away from the gun, resulting in a small, but noticeable, error.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img292.imageshack.us/my.php?image=shot000038lv.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img292.imageshack.us/img292/2669/shot000038lv.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />As for the alignment issues, it may be a matter of preference to particular players, I can't speak for anyone else, but in my opinion the shotgun feels most "right" in terms of how it is aligned, I have the easiest time aiming with it without a crosshair. In opposition to this the supershotgun draws a line farther to the left and considerably lower than the shotgun. I have spliced a picture of the shotgun and supershotgun together to demonstrate this.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img362.imageshack.us/my.php?image=splice6la.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img362.imageshack.us/img362/5333/splice6la.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />The machine gun has the same issue as the supershotgun, perhaps its not so much poor alignment as inconsistency which is making this so noticeable to me. If I weren't lazy I'd post pictures of the DooM 3 weapons.

Setting the damage to ten allows for mostly one shot kills against the light guards and also seems to speed up gameplay. This really is just personal preference, however, and can be ignored at will. If you would be so kind could you tell me whether or not what I'm doing, editing your mod, is welcome or not? In the meantime, I'm going to see if I can change D3's shotgun script to make it yet more to my liking (I'm very new to all this and the earlier mod to the D3 shotgun script and def file actually worked so I'm going to see if this new idea does as well).</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107895" date="Posted: Fri Aug 12, 2005 12:54 pm "><author>Crylar</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Kiltron wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">- WinXP SP2<br />- NVIDIA GeForce4 TI 4600<br />...<br />The TI 4600 isn't a recommended card for D3 itself, though it does run it.

Kiltron's site doesn't have a forum for discussing problems.
<br /><br />I'm really anxious to play this, but it is just soooooooo choppy, I can't do anything. There are parts where it runs ok, like underneath in the crawl space in the first level. But anytime there's anything special on screen it runs at less than 1 fps. By the time I "wake up" from the choppyness I'm either dead or nearly dead from enemies. Anytime there's an enemy on the screen especially it's just crawling! 
<br /><br />I'm very intersted to know if anyone else is having the same problem. Doom 3 runs smooth as silk on my computer. Every game I run does. I even set the specs as low as I could get them and it still just crawled along. I couldn't get past the first level.

The Wrong .dll API issue is that problem. Trying to run 1.3 gamecode with a 1.2 installation won't work.
<br /><br />The slowdowns people are getting from characters on screen is because this test release is aimed to test pushing characters using 2048x2048 texture maps down the pipe. That's why I say using a GeForce 6800 or equivalent or higher is recommended. That is D3's recommended card, and we're pushing just a little bit further using those texture sizes. This isn't on all surfaces, just the characters.

Or maybe I'm just stupid but when you start in the first map, you can take two routes.

<br /><br />I did the last but after you jumped in the water there is no way of returning. This wouldn't be a problem but the door leading back to the beginning is locked [the one with the turret operation panel next to it]. Since I wasn't able to deactive the red lasers I figured I must have missed something, but after some searching it appeared the only way of getting back to the beginning was using "Noclip" to get through the door.
<br /><br />I didn't find anything special so how do you put the red lasers of ? I eventually used God mode to get through and I hate cheating.
<br /><br />Also the site mentions that the mod wouldn't be a clone, but this sure as hell looks and plays a lot like Quake 2 to me.

<br /><br /><br />To turn off the lasers, when you reach the "water room" swim as far to the right as you can, go underwater, look around for a bit. There will be a room with lasers and a path around them to a control panel where you can turn off the lasers.

						<div class="postbody">Kiltron, hope you don't mind but I'm going to start this post with another error I saw, this time in the supershotgun pump animation. When the action is being pumped backwards the hand pulls the forearm away from the gun, resulting in a small, but noticeable, error.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img292.imageshack.us/my.php?image=shot000038lv.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img292.imageshack.us/img292/2669/shot000038lv.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />As for the alignment issues, it may be a matter of preference to particular players, I can't speak for anyone else, but in my opinion the shotgun feels most "right" in terms of how it is aligned, I have the easiest time aiming with it without a crosshair. In opposition to this the supershotgun draws a line farther to the left and considerably lower than the shotgun. I have spliced a picture of the shotgun and supershotgun together to demonstrate this.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img362.imageshack.us/my.php?image=splice6la.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img362.imageshack.us/img362/5333/splice6la.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />The machine gun has the same issue as the supershotgun, perhaps its not so much poor alignment as inconsistency which is making this so noticeable to me. If I weren't lazy I'd post pictures of the DooM 3 weapons.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img361.imageshack.us/my.php?image=splice27bx.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img361.imageshack.us/img361/8310/splice27bx.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />Hope this helps, I had a great time playing through this first test build. Thanks for your time and work.
<br /><br />Edited because I forget to remove particular words when I change grammar and thus sentences read oddly.</div>

						<div class="postbody">I also just made a new pk4 to see what a decent damage would be for the shotgun, don't think I'm going to mess with the other weapons right now. Setting the damage to ten allows for mostly one shot kills against the light guards and also seems to speed up gameplay. This really is just personal preference, however, and can be ignored at will. If you would be so kind could you tell me whether or not what I'm doing, editing your mod, is welcome or not? In the meantime, I'm going to see if I can change D3's shotgun script to make it yet more to my liking (I'm very new to all this and the earlier mod to the D3 shotgun script and def file actually worked so I'm going to see if this new idea does as well).</div>

						<div class="postbody">Ahh, I didn't see this forum about the mod. Kiltron's site doesn't have a forum for discussing problems.
<br /><br />I'm really anxious to play this, but it is just soooooooo choppy, I can't do anything. There are parts where it runs ok, like underneath in the crawl space in the first level. But anytime there's anything special on screen it runs at less than 1 fps. By the time I "wake up" from the choppyness I'm either dead or nearly dead from enemies. Anytime there's an enemy on the screen especially it's just crawling! 
<br /><br />I'm very intersted to know if anyone else is having the same problem. Doom 3 runs smooth as silk on my computer. Every game I run does. I even set the specs as low as I could get them and it still just crawled along. I couldn't get past the first level.
<br /><br />My PC is:
<br />P4 2.0 gig
<br />1 gig ram
<br />GeForce fx 5900 128 megs ram</div>

						<div class="postbody">Crylar, the only possible explanation is you don't have D3 patched properly to 1.3. The Wrong .dll API issue is that problem. Trying to run 1.3 gamecode with a 1.2 installation won't work.
<br /><br />The slowdowns people are getting from characters on screen is because this test release is aimed to test pushing characters using 2048x2048 texture maps down the pipe. That's why I say using a GeForce 6800 or equivalent or higher is recommended. That is D3's recommended card, and we're pushing just a little bit further using those texture sizes. This isn't on all surfaces, just the characters.
<br /><br />GeForce fx 5900 128 megs ram
<br /><br />That's not really going to perform well. Nothing against your card, but that's just how the mod is.</div>

						<div class="postbody">Maybe it's because it's late and I'm tired. Or maybe I'm just stupid but when you start in the first map, you can take two routes. Crawling beneath the rock to get to the broken elevator room or shoot the window and crawl down to end up in the water room. 
<br /><br />I did the last but after you jumped in the water there is no way of returning. This wouldn't be a problem but the door leading back to the beginning is locked [the one with the turret operation panel next to it]. Since I wasn't able to deactive the red lasers I figured I must have missed something, but after some searching it appeared the only way of getting back to the beginning was using "Noclip" to get through the door.
<br /><br />I didn't find anything special so how do you put the red lasers of ? I eventually used God mode to get through and I hate cheating.
<br /><br />Also the site mentions that the mod wouldn't be a clone, but this sure as hell looks and plays a lot like Quake 2 to me. I'd hoped to see brand new levels <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></div>

<br /><br /><br />To turn off the lasers, when you reach the "water room" swim as far to the right as you can, go underwater, look around for a bit. There will be a room with lasers and a path around them to a control panel where you can turn off the lasers.

						<div class="postbody">Well it seems as though I've tracked down the source of my massive slowdowns. My video card's fan took a dump on me and I nearly burned up my card. Luckily I tracked down the problem soon enough and I've been able to keep it cool with a mini fan until I get ahold of the manufacturer to find out if it's covered under warrantee. My Trackmania is playing again, and this mod plays just fine. There's some choppyness to it, but that'll get hammered out by final release i'm sure.</div>

When the action is being pumped backwards the hand pulls the forearm away from the gun, resulting in a small, but noticeable, error.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img292.imageshack.us/my.php?image=shot000038lv.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img292.imageshack.us/img292/2669/shot000038lv.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />As for the alignment issues, it may be a matter of preference to particular players, I can't speak for anyone else, but in my opinion the shotgun feels most "right" in terms of how it is aligned, I have the easiest time aiming with it without a crosshair. In opposition to this the supershotgun draws a line farther to the left and considerably lower than the shotgun. I have spliced a picture of the shotgun and supershotgun together to demonstrate this.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img362.imageshack.us/my.php?image=splice6la.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img362.imageshack.us/img362/5333/splice6la.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />The machine gun has the same issue as the supershotgun, perhaps its not so much poor alignment as inconsistency which is making this so noticeable to me. If I weren't lazy I'd post pictures of the DooM 3 weapons.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img361.imageshack.us/my.php?image=splice27bx.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img361.imageshack.us/img361/8310/splice27bx.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>

Setting the damage to ten allows for mostly one shot kills against the light guards and also seems to speed up gameplay. This really is just personal preference, however, and can be ignored at will. If you would be so kind could you tell me whether or not what I'm doing, editing your mod, is welcome or not? In the meantime, I'm going to see if I can change D3's shotgun script to make it yet more to my liking (I'm very new to all this and the earlier mod to the D3 shotgun script and def file actually worked so I'm going to see if this new idea does as well).</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107895" date="Posted: Fri Aug 12, 2005 12:54 pm "><author>Crylar</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Kiltron wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">- WinXP SP2<br />- NVIDIA GeForce4 TI 4600<br />...<br />The TI 4600 isn't a recommended card for D3 itself, though it does run it.

Kiltron's site doesn't have a forum for discussing problems.
<br /><br />I'm really anxious to play this, but it is just soooooooo choppy, I can't do anything. There are parts where it runs ok, like underneath in the crawl space in the first level. But anytime there's anything special on screen it runs at less than 1 fps. By the time I "wake up" from the choppyness I'm either dead or nearly dead from enemies. Anytime there's an enemy on the screen especially it's just crawling! 
<br /><br />I'm very intersted to know if anyone else is having the same problem. Doom 3 runs smooth as silk on my computer. Every game I run does. I even set the specs as low as I could get them and it still just crawled along. I couldn't get past the first level.

The Wrong .dll API issue is that problem. Trying to run 1.3 gamecode with a 1.2 installation won't work.
<br /><br />The slowdowns people are getting from characters on screen is because this test release is aimed to test pushing characters using 2048x2048 texture maps down the pipe. That's why I say using a GeForce 6800 or equivalent or higher is recommended. That is D3's recommended card, and we're pushing just a little bit further using those texture sizes. This isn't on all surfaces, just the characters.
<br /><br />GeForce fx 5900 128 megs ram
<br /><br />That's not really going to perform well.

Or maybe I'm just stupid but when you start in the first map, you can take two routes. Crawling beneath the rock to get to the broken elevator room or shoot the window and crawl down to end up in the water room. 
<br /><br />I did the last but after you jumped in the water there is no way of returning. This wouldn't be a problem but the door leading back to the beginning is locked [the one with the turret operation panel next to it]. Since I wasn't able to deactive the red lasers I figured I must have missed something, but after some searching it appeared the only way of getting back to the beginning was using "Noclip" to get through the door.
<br /><br />I didn't find anything special so how do you put the red lasers of ? I eventually used God mode to get through and I hate cheating.
<br /><br />Also the site mentions that the mod wouldn't be a clone, but this sure as hell looks and plays a lot like Quake 2 to me. I'd hoped to see brand new levels <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p108089" date="Posted: Sat Aug 13, 2005 10:42 pm "><author>SilentSoD</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">*Spoilers*
<br /><br /><br />To turn off the lasers, when you reach the "water room" swim as far to the right as you can, go underwater, look around for a bit. There will be a room with lasers and a path around them to a control panel where you can turn off the lasers.
<br /><br />There's an easter egg in the room as well.

						<div class="postbody">Kiltron, hope you don't mind but I'm going to start this post with another error I saw, this time in the supershotgun pump animation. When the action is being pumped backwards the hand pulls the forearm away from the gun, resulting in a small, but noticeable, error.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img292.imageshack.us/my.php?image=shot000038lv.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img292.imageshack.us/img292/2669/shot000038lv.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />As for the alignment issues, it may be a matter of preference to particular players, I can't speak for anyone else, but in my opinion the shotgun feels most "right" in terms of how it is aligned, I have the easiest time aiming with it without a crosshair. In opposition to this the supershotgun draws a line farther to the left and considerably lower than the shotgun. I have spliced a picture of the shotgun and supershotgun together to demonstrate this.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img362.imageshack.us/my.php?image=splice6la.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img362.imageshack.us/img362/5333/splice6la.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />The machine gun has the same issue as the supershotgun, perhaps its not so much poor alignment as inconsistency which is making this so noticeable to me. If I weren't lazy I'd post pictures of the DooM 3 weapons.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img361.imageshack.us/my.php?image=splice27bx.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img361.imageshack.us/img361/8310/splice27bx.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />Hope this helps, I had a great time playing through this first test build. Thanks for your time and work.
<br /><br />Edited because I forget to remove particular words when I change grammar and thus sentences read oddly.</div>

						<div class="postbody">I also just made a new pk4 to see what a decent damage would be for the shotgun, don't think I'm going to mess with the other weapons right now. Setting the damage to ten allows for mostly one shot kills against the light guards and also seems to speed up gameplay. This really is just personal preference, however, and can be ignored at will. If you would be so kind could you tell me whether or not what I'm doing, editing your mod, is welcome or not? In the meantime, I'm going to see if I can change D3's shotgun script to make it yet more to my liking (I'm very new to all this and the earlier mod to the D3 shotgun script and def file actually worked so I'm going to see if this new idea does as well).</div>

						<div class="postbody">Ahh, I didn't see this forum about the mod. Kiltron's site doesn't have a forum for discussing problems.
<br /><br />I'm really anxious to play this, but it is just soooooooo choppy, I can't do anything. There are parts where it runs ok, like underneath in the crawl space in the first level. But anytime there's anything special on screen it runs at less than 1 fps. By the time I "wake up" from the choppyness I'm either dead or nearly dead from enemies. Anytime there's an enemy on the screen especially it's just crawling! 
<br /><br />I'm very intersted to know if anyone else is having the same problem. Doom 3 runs smooth as silk on my computer. Every game I run does. I even set the specs as low as I could get them and it still just crawled along. I couldn't get past the first level.
<br /><br />My PC is:
<br />P4 2.0 gig
<br />1 gig ram
<br />GeForce fx 5900 128 megs ram</div>

						<div class="postbody">Crylar, the only possible explanation is you don't have D3 patched properly to 1.3. The Wrong .dll API issue is that problem. Trying to run 1.3 gamecode with a 1.2 installation won't work.
<br /><br />The slowdowns people are getting from characters on screen is because this test release is aimed to test pushing characters using 2048x2048 texture maps down the pipe. That's why I say using a GeForce 6800 or equivalent or higher is recommended. That is D3's recommended card, and we're pushing just a little bit further using those texture sizes. This isn't on all surfaces, just the characters.
<br /><br />GeForce fx 5900 128 megs ram
<br /><br />That's not really going to perform well. Nothing against your card, but that's just how the mod is.</div>

						<div class="postbody">Maybe it's because it's late and I'm tired. Or maybe I'm just stupid but when you start in the first map, you can take two routes. Crawling beneath the rock to get to the broken elevator room or shoot the window and crawl down to end up in the water room. 
<br /><br />I did the last but after you jumped in the water there is no way of returning. This wouldn't be a problem but the door leading back to the beginning is locked [the one with the turret operation panel next to it]. Since I wasn't able to deactive the red lasers I figured I must have missed something, but after some searching it appeared the only way of getting back to the beginning was using "Noclip" to get through the door.
<br /><br />I didn't find anything special so how do you put the red lasers of ? I eventually used God mode to get through and I hate cheating.
<br /><br />Also the site mentions that the mod wouldn't be a clone, but this sure as hell looks and plays a lot like Quake 2 to me. I'd hoped to see brand new levels <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></div>

<br /><br /><br />To turn off the lasers, when you reach the "water room" swim as far to the right as you can, go underwater, look around for a bit. There will be a room with lasers and a path around them to a control panel where you can turn off the lasers.

						<div class="postbody">Well it seems as though I've tracked down the source of my massive slowdowns. My video card's fan took a dump on me and I nearly burned up my card. Luckily I tracked down the problem soon enough and I've been able to keep it cool with a mini fan until I get ahold of the manufacturer to find out if it's covered under warrantee. My Trackmania is playing again, and this mod plays just fine. There's some choppyness to it, but that'll get hammered out by final release i'm sure.</div>

When the action is being pumped backwards the hand pulls the forearm away from the gun, resulting in a small, but noticeable, error.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img292.imageshack.us/my.php?image=shot000038lv.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img292.imageshack.us/img292/2669/shot000038lv.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />As for the alignment issues, it may be a matter of preference to particular players, I can't speak for anyone else, but in my opinion the shotgun feels most "right" in terms of how it is aligned, I have the easiest time aiming with it without a crosshair. In opposition to this the supershotgun draws a line farther to the left and considerably lower than the shotgun. I have spliced a picture of the shotgun and supershotgun together to demonstrate this.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img362.imageshack.us/my.php?image=splice6la.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img362.imageshack.us/img362/5333/splice6la.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />The machine gun has the same issue as the supershotgun, perhaps its not so much poor alignment as inconsistency which is making this so noticeable to me. If I weren't lazy I'd post pictures of the DooM 3 weapons.

Setting the damage to ten allows for mostly one shot kills against the light guards and also seems to speed up gameplay. This really is just personal preference, however, and can be ignored at will. If you would be so kind could you tell me whether or not what I'm doing, editing your mod, is welcome or not? In the meantime, I'm going to see if I can change D3's shotgun script to make it yet more to my liking (I'm very new to all this and the earlier mod to the D3 shotgun script and def file actually worked so I'm going to see if this new idea does as well).</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107895" date="Posted: Fri Aug 12, 2005 12:54 pm "><author>Crylar</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Kiltron wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">- WinXP SP2<br />- NVIDIA GeForce4 TI 4600<br />...<br />The TI 4600 isn't a recommended card for D3 itself, though it does run it.

Kiltron's site doesn't have a forum for discussing problems.
<br /><br />I'm really anxious to play this, but it is just soooooooo choppy, I can't do anything. There are parts where it runs ok, like underneath in the crawl space in the first level. But anytime there's anything special on screen it runs at less than 1 fps. By the time I "wake up" from the choppyness I'm either dead or nearly dead from enemies. Anytime there's an enemy on the screen especially it's just crawling! 
<br /><br />I'm very intersted to know if anyone else is having the same problem. Doom 3 runs smooth as silk on my computer. Every game I run does. I even set the specs as low as I could get them and it still just crawled along. I couldn't get past the first level.

The Wrong .dll API issue is that problem. Trying to run 1.3 gamecode with a 1.2 installation won't work.
<br /><br />The slowdowns people are getting from characters on screen is because this test release is aimed to test pushing characters using 2048x2048 texture maps down the pipe. That's why I say using a GeForce 6800 or equivalent or higher is recommended. That is D3's recommended card, and we're pushing just a little bit further using those texture sizes. This isn't on all surfaces, just the characters.
<br /><br />GeForce fx 5900 128 megs ram
<br /><br />That's not really going to perform well. Nothing against your card, but that's just how the mod is.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107961" date="Posted: Fri Aug 12, 2005 9:17 pm "><author>Infernis</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">What about my problems Kiltron ?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107987" date="Posted: Sat Aug 13, 2005 12:51 am "><author>Kiltron</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">TheJugglah, can you post a copy of the console text that is printing when you get that error?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107991" date="Posted: Sat Aug 13, 2005 1:33 am "><author>SonicClang</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Kiltron, any plans on getting a lower poly version for people like me? ya know... the majority of people playing Doom 3.

Or maybe I'm just stupid but when you start in the first map, you can take two routes. Crawling beneath the rock to get to the broken elevator room or shoot the window and crawl down to end up in the water room. 
<br /><br />I did the last but after you jumped in the water there is no way of returning. This wouldn't be a problem but the door leading back to the beginning is locked [the one with the turret operation panel next to it]. Since I wasn't able to deactive the red lasers I figured I must have missed something, but after some searching it appeared the only way of getting back to the beginning was using "Noclip" to get through the door.
<br /><br />I didn't find anything special so how do you put the red lasers of ? I eventually used God mode to get through and I hate cheating.
<br /><br />Also the site mentions that the mod wouldn't be a clone, but this sure as hell looks and plays a lot like Quake 2 to me. I'd hoped to see brand new levels <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p108089" date="Posted: Sat Aug 13, 2005 10:42 pm "><author>SilentSoD</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">*Spoilers*
<br /><br /><br />To turn off the lasers, when you reach the "water room" swim as far to the right as you can, go underwater, look around for a bit. There will be a room with lasers and a path around them to a control panel where you can turn off the lasers.
<br /><br />There's an easter egg in the room as well.

						<div class="postbody">Kiltron, hope you don't mind but I'm going to start this post with another error I saw, this time in the supershotgun pump animation. When the action is being pumped backwards the hand pulls the forearm away from the gun, resulting in a small, but noticeable, error.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img292.imageshack.us/my.php?image=shot000038lv.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img292.imageshack.us/img292/2669/shot000038lv.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />As for the alignment issues, it may be a matter of preference to particular players, I can't speak for anyone else, but in my opinion the shotgun feels most "right" in terms of how it is aligned, I have the easiest time aiming with it without a crosshair. In opposition to this the supershotgun draws a line farther to the left and considerably lower than the shotgun. I have spliced a picture of the shotgun and supershotgun together to demonstrate this.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img362.imageshack.us/my.php?image=splice6la.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img362.imageshack.us/img362/5333/splice6la.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />The machine gun has the same issue as the supershotgun, perhaps its not so much poor alignment as inconsistency which is making this so noticeable to me. If I weren't lazy I'd post pictures of the DooM 3 weapons.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img361.imageshack.us/my.php?image=splice27bx.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img361.imageshack.us/img361/8310/splice27bx.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />Hope this helps, I had a great time playing through this first test build. Thanks for your time and work.
<br /><br />Edited because I forget to remove particular words when I change grammar and thus sentences read oddly.</div>

						<div class="postbody">I also just made a new pk4 to see what a decent damage would be for the shotgun, don't think I'm going to mess with the other weapons right now. Setting the damage to ten allows for mostly one shot kills against the light guards and also seems to speed up gameplay. This really is just personal preference, however, and can be ignored at will. If you would be so kind could you tell me whether or not what I'm doing, editing your mod, is welcome or not? In the meantime, I'm going to see if I can change D3's shotgun script to make it yet more to my liking (I'm very new to all this and the earlier mod to the D3 shotgun script and def file actually worked so I'm going to see if this new idea does as well).</div>

						<div class="postbody">Ahh, I didn't see this forum about the mod. Kiltron's site doesn't have a forum for discussing problems.
<br /><br />I'm really anxious to play this, but it is just soooooooo choppy, I can't do anything. There are parts where it runs ok, like underneath in the crawl space in the first level. But anytime there's anything special on screen it runs at less than 1 fps. By the time I "wake up" from the choppyness I'm either dead or nearly dead from enemies. Anytime there's an enemy on the screen especially it's just crawling! 
<br /><br />I'm very intersted to know if anyone else is having the same problem. Doom 3 runs smooth as silk on my computer. Every game I run does. I even set the specs as low as I could get them and it still just crawled along. I couldn't get past the first level.
<br /><br />My PC is:
<br />P4 2.0 gig
<br />1 gig ram
<br />GeForce fx 5900 128 megs ram</div>

						<div class="postbody">Crylar, the only possible explanation is you don't have D3 patched properly to 1.3. The Wrong .dll API issue is that problem. Trying to run 1.3 gamecode with a 1.2 installation won't work.
<br /><br />The slowdowns people are getting from characters on screen is because this test release is aimed to test pushing characters using 2048x2048 texture maps down the pipe. That's why I say using a GeForce 6800 or equivalent or higher is recommended. That is D3's recommended card, and we're pushing just a little bit further using those texture sizes. This isn't on all surfaces, just the characters.

						<div class="postbody">Maybe it's because it's late and I'm tired. Or maybe I'm just stupid but when you start in the first map, you can take two routes. Crawling beneath the rock to get to the broken elevator room or shoot the window and crawl down to end up in the water room. 
<br /><br />I did the last but after you jumped in the water there is no way of returning. This wouldn't be a problem but the door leading back to the beginning is locked [the one with the turret operation panel next to it]. Since I wasn't able to deactive the red lasers I figured I must have missed something, but after some searching it appeared the only way of getting back to the beginning was using "Noclip" to get through the door.
<br /><br />I didn't find anything special so how do you put the red lasers of ? I eventually used God mode to get through and I hate cheating.
<br /><br />Also the site mentions that the mod wouldn't be a clone, but this sure as hell looks and plays a lot like Quake 2 to me. I'd hoped to see brand new levels <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></div>

						<div class="postbody">Well it seems as though I've tracked down the source of my massive slowdowns. My video card's fan took a dump on me and I nearly burned up my card. Luckily I tracked down the problem soon enough and I've been able to keep it cool with a mini fan until I get ahold of the manufacturer to find out if it's covered under warrantee. My Trackmania is playing again, and this mod plays just fine. There's some choppyness to it, but that'll get hammered out by final release i'm sure.</div>

When the action is being pumped backwards the hand pulls the forearm away from the gun, resulting in a small, but noticeable, error.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img292.imageshack.us/my.php?image=shot000038lv.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img292.imageshack.us/img292/2669/shot000038lv.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />As for the alignment issues, it may be a matter of preference to particular players, I can't speak for anyone else, but in my opinion the shotgun feels most "right" in terms of how it is aligned, I have the easiest time aiming with it without a crosshair. In opposition to this the supershotgun draws a line farther to the left and considerably lower than the shotgun. I have spliced a picture of the shotgun and supershotgun together to demonstrate this.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img362.imageshack.us/my.php?image=splice6la.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img362.imageshack.us/img362/5333/splice6la.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />The machine gun has the same issue as the supershotgun, perhaps its not so much poor alignment as inconsistency which is making this so noticeable to me. If I weren't lazy I'd post pictures of the DooM 3 weapons.

Setting the damage to ten allows for mostly one shot kills against the light guards and also seems to speed up gameplay. This really is just personal preference, however, and can be ignored at will. If you would be so kind could you tell me whether or not what I'm doing, editing your mod, is welcome or not? In the meantime, I'm going to see if I can change D3's shotgun script to make it yet more to my liking (I'm very new to all this and the earlier mod to the D3 shotgun script and def file actually worked so I'm going to see if this new idea does as well).</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107895" date="Posted: Fri Aug 12, 2005 12:54 pm "><author>Crylar</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Kiltron wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">- WinXP SP2<br />- NVIDIA GeForce4 TI 4600<br />...<br />The TI 4600 isn't a recommended card for D3 itself, though it does run it.

<br /><br />But plz halp me with this, I'm uber hot for this Q2 mod and need to try it.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107942" date="Posted: Fri Aug 12, 2005 7:06 pm "><author>SonicClang</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Ahh, I didn't see this forum about the mod. Kiltron's site doesn't have a forum for discussing problems.
<br /><br />I'm really anxious to play this, but it is just soooooooo choppy, I can't do anything. There are parts where it runs ok, like underneath in the crawl space in the first level. But anytime there's anything special on screen it runs at less than 1 fps. By the time I "wake up" from the choppyness I'm either dead or nearly dead from enemies. Anytime there's an enemy on the screen especially it's just crawling! 
<br /><br />I'm very intersted to know if anyone else is having the same problem. Doom 3 runs smooth as silk on my computer. Every game I run does. I even set the specs as low as I could get them and it still just crawled along. I couldn't get past the first level.

<br />1 gig ram

The Wrong .dll API issue is that problem. Trying to run 1.3 gamecode with a 1.2 installation won't work.
<br /><br />The slowdowns people are getting from characters on screen is because this test release is aimed to test pushing characters using 2048x2048 texture maps down the pipe. That's why I say using a GeForce 6800 or equivalent or higher is recommended. That is D3's recommended card, and we're pushing just a little bit further using those texture sizes. This isn't on all surfaces, just the characters.
<br /><br />GeForce fx 5900 128 megs ram
<br /><br />That's not really going to perform well. Nothing against your card, but that's just how the mod is.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107961" date="Posted: Fri Aug 12, 2005 9:17 pm "><author>Infernis</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">What about my problems Kiltron ?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107987" date="Posted: Sat Aug 13, 2005 12:51 am "><author>Kiltron</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">TheJugglah, can you post a copy of the console text that is printing when you get that error?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107991" date="Posted: Sat Aug 13, 2005 1:33 am "><author>SonicClang</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Kiltron, any plans on getting a lower poly version for people like me? ya know... the majority of people playing Doom 3.

Or maybe I'm just stupid but when you start in the first map, you can take two routes. Crawling beneath the rock to get to the broken elevator room or shoot the window and crawl down to end up in the water room. 
<br /><br />I did the last but after you jumped in the water there is no way of returning. This wouldn't be a problem but the door leading back to the beginning is locked [the one with the turret operation panel next to it]. Since I wasn't able to deactive the red lasers I figured I must have missed something, but after some searching it appeared the only way of getting back to the beginning was using "Noclip" to get through the door.
<br /><br />I didn't find anything special so how do you put the red lasers of ? I eventually used God mode to get through and I hate cheating.
<br /><br />Also the site mentions that the mod wouldn't be a clone, but this sure as hell looks and plays a lot like Quake 2 to me. I'd hoped to see brand new levels <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p108089" date="Posted: Sat Aug 13, 2005 10:42 pm "><author>SilentSoD</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">*Spoilers*
<br /><br /><br />To turn off the lasers, when you reach the "water room" swim as far to the right as you can, go underwater, look around for a bit. There will be a room with lasers and a path around them to a control panel where you can turn off the lasers.
<br /><br />There's an easter egg in the room as well.

						<div class="postbody">Kiltron, hope you don't mind but I'm going to start this post with another error I saw, this time in the supershotgun pump animation. When the action is being pumped backwards the hand pulls the forearm away from the gun, resulting in a small, but noticeable, error.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img292.imageshack.us/my.php?image=shot000038lv.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img292.imageshack.us/img292/2669/shot000038lv.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />As for the alignment issues, it may be a matter of preference to particular players, I can't speak for anyone else, but in my opinion the shotgun feels most "right" in terms of how it is aligned, I have the easiest time aiming with it without a crosshair. In opposition to this the supershotgun draws a line farther to the left and considerably lower than the shotgun. I have spliced a picture of the shotgun and supershotgun together to demonstrate this.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img362.imageshack.us/my.php?image=splice6la.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img362.imageshack.us/img362/5333/splice6la.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />The machine gun has the same issue as the supershotgun, perhaps its not so much poor alignment as inconsistency which is making this so noticeable to me. If I weren't lazy I'd post pictures of the DooM 3 weapons.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img361.imageshack.us/my.php?image=splice27bx.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img361.imageshack.us/img361/8310/splice27bx.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />Hope this helps, I had a great time playing through this first test build. Thanks for your time and work.
<br /><br />Edited because I forget to remove particular words when I change grammar and thus sentences read oddly.</div>

						<div class="postbody">I also just made a new pk4 to see what a decent damage would be for the shotgun, don't think I'm going to mess with the other weapons right now. Setting the damage to ten allows for mostly one shot kills against the light guards and also seems to speed up gameplay. This really is just personal preference, however, and can be ignored at will. If you would be so kind could you tell me whether or not what I'm doing, editing your mod, is welcome or not? In the meantime, I'm going to see if I can change D3's shotgun script to make it yet more to my liking (I'm very new to all this and the earlier mod to the D3 shotgun script and def file actually worked so I'm going to see if this new idea does as well).</div>

						<div class="postbody">Ahh, I didn't see this forum about the mod. Kiltron's site doesn't have a forum for discussing problems.
<br /><br />I'm really anxious to play this, but it is just soooooooo choppy, I can't do anything. There are parts where it runs ok, like underneath in the crawl space in the first level. But anytime there's anything special on screen it runs at less than 1 fps. By the time I "wake up" from the choppyness I'm either dead or nearly dead from enemies. Anytime there's an enemy on the screen especially it's just crawling! 
<br /><br />I'm very intersted to know if anyone else is having the same problem. Doom 3 runs smooth as silk on my computer. Every game I run does. I even set the specs as low as I could get them and it still just crawled along. I couldn't get past the first level.
<br /><br />My PC is:
<br />P4 2.0 gig
<br />1 gig ram
<br />GeForce fx 5900 128 megs ram</div>

						<div class="postbody">Crylar, the only possible explanation is you don't have D3 patched properly to 1.3. The Wrong .dll API issue is that problem. Trying to run 1.3 gamecode with a 1.2 installation won't work.
<br /><br />The slowdowns people are getting from characters on screen is because this test release is aimed to test pushing characters using 2048x2048 texture maps down the pipe. That's why I say using a GeForce 6800 or equivalent or higher is recommended. That is D3's recommended card, and we're pushing just a little bit further using those texture sizes. This isn't on all surfaces, just the characters.

<br /><br />That's not really going to perform well. Nothing against your card, but that's just how the mod is.</div>

						<div class="postbody">Maybe it's because it's late and I'm tired. Or maybe I'm just stupid but when you start in the first map, you can take two routes. Crawling beneath the rock to get to the broken elevator room or shoot the window and crawl down to end up in the water room. 
<br /><br />I did the last but after you jumped in the water there is no way of returning. This wouldn't be a problem but the door leading back to the beginning is locked [the one with the turret operation panel next to it]. Since I wasn't able to deactive the red lasers I figured I must have missed something, but after some searching it appeared the only way of getting back to the beginning was using "Noclip" to get through the door.
<br /><br />I didn't find anything special so how do you put the red lasers of ? I eventually used God mode to get through and I hate cheating.
<br /><br />Also the site mentions that the mod wouldn't be a clone, but this sure as hell looks and plays a lot like Quake 2 to me.

						<div class="postbody">Well it seems as though I've tracked down the source of my massive slowdowns. My video card's fan took a dump on me and I nearly burned up my card. Luckily I tracked down the problem soon enough and I've been able to keep it cool with a mini fan until I get ahold of the manufacturer to find out if it's covered under warrantee. My Trackmania is playing again, and this mod plays just fine. There's some choppyness to it, but that'll get hammered out by final release i'm sure.</div>

When the action is being pumped backwards the hand pulls the forearm away from the gun, resulting in a small, but noticeable, error.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img292.imageshack.us/my.php?image=shot000038lv.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img292.imageshack.us/img292/2669/shot000038lv.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />As for the alignment issues, it may be a matter of preference to particular players, I can't speak for anyone else, but in my opinion the shotgun feels most "right" in terms of how it is aligned, I have the easiest time aiming with it without a crosshair. In opposition to this the supershotgun draws a line farther to the left and considerably lower than the shotgun. I have spliced a picture of the shotgun and supershotgun together to demonstrate this.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img362.imageshack.us/my.php?image=splice6la.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img362.imageshack.us/img362/5333/splice6la.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />The machine gun has the same issue as the supershotgun, perhaps its not so much poor alignment as inconsistency which is making this so noticeable to me. If I weren't lazy I'd post pictures of the DooM 3 weapons.

Setting the damage to ten allows for mostly one shot kills against the light guards and also seems to speed up gameplay. This really is just personal preference, however, and can be ignored at will. If you would be so kind could you tell me whether or not what I'm doing, editing your mod, is welcome or not? In the meantime, I'm going to see if I can change D3's shotgun script to make it yet more to my liking (I'm very new to all this and the earlier mod to the D3 shotgun script and def file actually worked so I'm going to see if this new idea does as well).</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107895" date="Posted: Fri Aug 12, 2005 12:54 pm "><author>Crylar</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Kiltron wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">- WinXP SP2<br />- NVIDIA GeForce4 TI 4600<br />...<br />The TI 4600 isn't a recommended card for D3 itself, though it does run it.

Kiltron's site doesn't have a forum for discussing problems.
<br /><br />I'm really anxious to play this, but it is just soooooooo choppy, I can't do anything. There are parts where it runs ok, like underneath in the crawl space in the first level. But anytime there's anything special on screen it runs at less than 1 fps. By the time I "wake up" from the choppyness I'm either dead or nearly dead from enemies. Anytime there's an enemy on the screen especially it's just crawling! 
<br /><br />I'm very intersted to know if anyone else is having the same problem. Doom 3 runs smooth as silk on my computer. Every game I run does. I even set the specs as low as I could get them and it still just crawled along. I couldn't get past the first level.

The Wrong .dll API issue is that problem. Trying to run 1.3 gamecode with a 1.2 installation won't work.
<br /><br />The slowdowns people are getting from characters on screen is because this test release is aimed to test pushing characters using 2048x2048 texture maps down the pipe. That's why I say using a GeForce 6800 or equivalent or higher is recommended. That is D3's recommended card, and we're pushing just a little bit further using those texture sizes. This isn't on all surfaces, just the characters.

Or maybe I'm just stupid but when you start in the first map, you can take two routes. Crawling beneath the rock to get to the broken elevator room or shoot the window and crawl down to end up in the water room. 
<br /><br />I did the last but after you jumped in the water there is no way of returning. This wouldn't be a problem but the door leading back to the beginning is locked [the one with the turret operation panel next to it]. Since I wasn't able to deactive the red lasers I figured I must have missed something, but after some searching it appeared the only way of getting back to the beginning was using "Noclip" to get through the door.
<br /><br />I didn't find anything special so how do you put the red lasers of ? I eventually used God mode to get through and I hate cheating.
<br /><br />Also the site mentions that the mod wouldn't be a clone, but this sure as hell looks and plays a lot like Quake 2 to me. I'd hoped to see brand new levels <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p108089" date="Posted: Sat Aug 13, 2005 10:42 pm "><author>SilentSoD</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">*Spoilers*
<br /><br /><br />To turn off the lasers, when you reach the "water room" swim as far to the right as you can, go underwater, look around for a bit. There will be a room with lasers and a path around them to a control panel where you can turn off the lasers.
<br /><br />There's an easter egg in the room as well.

						<div class="postbody">Kiltron, hope you don't mind but I'm going to start this post with another error I saw, this time in the supershotgun pump animation. When the action is being pumped backwards the hand pulls the forearm away from the gun, resulting in a small, but noticeable, error.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img292.imageshack.us/my.php?image=shot000038lv.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img292.imageshack.us/img292/2669/shot000038lv.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />As for the alignment issues, it may be a matter of preference to particular players, I can't speak for anyone else, but in my opinion the shotgun feels most "right" in terms of how it is aligned, I have the easiest time aiming with it without a crosshair. In opposition to this the supershotgun draws a line farther to the left and considerably lower than the shotgun. I have spliced a picture of the shotgun and supershotgun together to demonstrate this.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img362.imageshack.us/my.php?image=splice6la.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img362.imageshack.us/img362/5333/splice6la.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />The machine gun has the same issue as the supershotgun, perhaps its not so much poor alignment as inconsistency which is making this so noticeable to me. If I weren't lazy I'd post pictures of the DooM 3 weapons.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img361.imageshack.us/my.php?image=splice27bx.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img361.imageshack.us/img361/8310/splice27bx.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />Hope this helps, I had a great time playing through this first test build. Thanks for your time and work.
<br /><br />Edited because I forget to remove particular words when I change grammar and thus sentences read oddly.</div>

						<div class="postbody">I also just made a new pk4 to see what a decent damage would be for the shotgun, don't think I'm going to mess with the other weapons right now. Setting the damage to ten allows for mostly one shot kills against the light guards and also seems to speed up gameplay. This really is just personal preference, however, and can be ignored at will. If you would be so kind could you tell me whether or not what I'm doing, editing your mod, is welcome or not? In the meantime, I'm going to see if I can change D3's shotgun script to make it yet more to my liking (I'm very new to all this and the earlier mod to the D3 shotgun script and def file actually worked so I'm going to see if this new idea does as well).</div>

						<div class="postbody">Ahh, I didn't see this forum about the mod. Kiltron's site doesn't have a forum for discussing problems.
<br /><br />I'm really anxious to play this, but it is just soooooooo choppy, I can't do anything. There are parts where it runs ok, like underneath in the crawl space in the first level. But anytime there's anything special on screen it runs at less than 1 fps. By the time I "wake up" from the choppyness I'm either dead or nearly dead from enemies. Anytime there's an enemy on the screen especially it's just crawling! 
<br /><br />I'm very intersted to know if anyone else is having the same problem. Doom 3 runs smooth as silk on my computer. Every game I run does. I even set the specs as low as I could get them and it still just crawled along. I couldn't get past the first level.
<br /><br />My PC is:
<br />P4 2.0 gig
<br />1 gig ram
<br />GeForce fx 5900 128 megs ram</div>

						<div class="postbody">Crylar, the only possible explanation is you don't have D3 patched properly to 1.3. The Wrong .dll API issue is that problem. Trying to run 1.3 gamecode with a 1.2 installation won't work.
<br /><br />The slowdowns people are getting from characters on screen is because this test release is aimed to test pushing characters using 2048x2048 texture maps down the pipe. That's why I say using a GeForce 6800 or equivalent or higher is recommended. That is D3's recommended card, and we're pushing just a little bit further using those texture sizes. This isn't on all surfaces, just the characters.
<br /><br />GeForce fx 5900 128 megs ram
<br /><br />That's not really going to perform well. Nothing against your card, but that's just how the mod is.</div>

						<div class="postbody">Maybe it's because it's late and I'm tired. Or maybe I'm just stupid but when you start in the first map, you can take two routes. Crawling beneath the rock to get to the broken elevator room or shoot the window and crawl down to end up in the water room. 
<br /><br />I did the last but after you jumped in the water there is no way of returning. This wouldn't be a problem but the door leading back to the beginning is locked [the one with the turret operation panel next to it]. Since I wasn't able to deactive the red lasers I figured I must have missed something, but after some searching it appeared the only way of getting back to the beginning was using "Noclip" to get through the door.
<br /><br />I didn't find anything special so how do you put the red lasers of ? I eventually used God mode to get through and I hate cheating.
<br /><br />Also the site mentions that the mod wouldn't be a clone, but this sure as hell looks and plays a lot like Quake 2 to me. I'd hoped to see brand new levels <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></div>

When the action is being pumped backwards the hand pulls the forearm away from the gun, resulting in a small, but noticeable, error.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img292.imageshack.us/my.php?image=shot000038lv.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img292.imageshack.us/img292/2669/shot000038lv.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />As for the alignment issues, it may be a matter of preference to particular players, I can't speak for anyone else, but in my opinion the shotgun feels most "right" in terms of how it is aligned, I have the easiest time aiming with it without a crosshair. In opposition to this the supershotgun draws a line farther to the left and considerably lower than the shotgun. I have spliced a picture of the shotgun and supershotgun together to demonstrate this.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img362.imageshack.us/my.php?image=splice6la.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img362.imageshack.us/img362/5333/splice6la.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />The machine gun has the same issue as the supershotgun, perhaps its not so much poor alignment as inconsistency which is making this so noticeable to me. If I weren't lazy I'd post pictures of the DooM 3 weapons.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img361.imageshack.us/my.php?image=splice27bx.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img361.imageshack.us/img361/8310/splice27bx.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>

Setting the damage to ten allows for mostly one shot kills against the light guards and also seems to speed up gameplay. This really is just personal preference, however, and can be ignored at will. If you would be so kind could you tell me whether or not what I'm doing, editing your mod, is welcome or not? In the meantime, I'm going to see if I can change D3's shotgun script to make it yet more to my liking (I'm very new to all this and the earlier mod to the D3 shotgun script and def file actually worked so I'm going to see if this new idea does as well).</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107895" date="Posted: Fri Aug 12, 2005 12:54 pm "><author>Crylar</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Kiltron wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">- WinXP SP2<br />- NVIDIA GeForce4 TI 4600<br />...<br />The TI 4600 isn't a recommended card for D3 itself, though it does run it.

Kiltron's site doesn't have a forum for discussing problems.
<br /><br />I'm really anxious to play this, but it is just soooooooo choppy, I can't do anything. There are parts where it runs ok, like underneath in the crawl space in the first level. But anytime there's anything special on screen it runs at less than 1 fps. By the time I "wake up" from the choppyness I'm either dead or nearly dead from enemies. Anytime there's an enemy on the screen especially it's just crawling! 
<br /><br />I'm very intersted to know if anyone else is having the same problem. Doom 3 runs smooth as silk on my computer. Every game I run does. I even set the specs as low as I could get them and it still just crawled along. I couldn't get past the first level.

The Wrong .dll API issue is that problem. Trying to run 1.3 gamecode with a 1.2 installation won't work.
<br /><br />The slowdowns people are getting from characters on screen is because this test release is aimed to test pushing characters using 2048x2048 texture maps down the pipe. That's why I say using a GeForce 6800 or equivalent or higher is recommended. That is D3's recommended card, and we're pushing just a little bit further using those texture sizes. This isn't on all surfaces, just the characters.
<br /><br />GeForce fx 5900 128 megs ram
<br /><br />That's not really going to perform well.

Or maybe I'm just stupid but when you start in the first map, you can take two routes. Crawling beneath the rock to get to the broken elevator room or shoot the window and crawl down to end up in the water room. 
<br /><br />I did the last but after you jumped in the water there is no way of returning. This wouldn't be a problem but the door leading back to the beginning is locked [the one with the turret operation panel next to it]. Since I wasn't able to deactive the red lasers I figured I must have missed something, but after some searching it appeared the only way of getting back to the beginning was using "Noclip" to get through the door.
<br /><br />I didn't find anything special so how do you put the red lasers of ? I eventually used God mode to get through and I hate cheating.
<br /><br />Also the site mentions that the mod wouldn't be a clone, but this sure as hell looks and plays a lot like Quake 2 to me. I'd hoped to see brand new levels <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p108089" date="Posted: Sat Aug 13, 2005 10:42 pm "><author>SilentSoD</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">*Spoilers*
<br /><br /><br />To turn off the lasers, when you reach the "water room" swim as far to the right as you can, go underwater, look around for a bit. There will be a room with lasers and a path around them to a control panel where you can turn off the lasers.
<br /><br />There's an easter egg in the room as well.

						<div class="postbody">Kiltron, hope you don't mind but I'm going to start this post with another error I saw, this time in the supershotgun pump animation. When the action is being pumped backwards the hand pulls the forearm away from the gun, resulting in a small, but noticeable, error.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img292.imageshack.us/my.php?image=shot000038lv.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img292.imageshack.us/img292/2669/shot000038lv.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />As for the alignment issues, it may be a matter of preference to particular players, I can't speak for anyone else, but in my opinion the shotgun feels most "right" in terms of how it is aligned, I have the easiest time aiming with it without a crosshair. In opposition to this the supershotgun draws a line farther to the left and considerably lower than the shotgun. I have spliced a picture of the shotgun and supershotgun together to demonstrate this.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img362.imageshack.us/my.php?image=splice6la.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img362.imageshack.us/img362/5333/splice6la.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />The machine gun has the same issue as the supershotgun, perhaps its not so much poor alignment as inconsistency which is making this so noticeable to me. If I weren't lazy I'd post pictures of the DooM 3 weapons.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img361.imageshack.us/my.php?image=splice27bx.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img361.imageshack.us/img361/8310/splice27bx.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />Hope this helps, I had a great time playing through this first test build. Thanks for your time and work.
<br /><br />Edited because I forget to remove particular words when I change grammar and thus sentences read oddly.</div>

						<div class="postbody">I also just made a new pk4 to see what a decent damage would be for the shotgun, don't think I'm going to mess with the other weapons right now. Setting the damage to ten allows for mostly one shot kills against the light guards and also seems to speed up gameplay. This really is just personal preference, however, and can be ignored at will. If you would be so kind could you tell me whether or not what I'm doing, editing your mod, is welcome or not? In the meantime, I'm going to see if I can change D3's shotgun script to make it yet more to my liking (I'm very new to all this and the earlier mod to the D3 shotgun script and def file actually worked so I'm going to see if this new idea does as well).</div>

						<div class="postbody">Ahh, I didn't see this forum about the mod. Kiltron's site doesn't have a forum for discussing problems.
<br /><br />I'm really anxious to play this, but it is just soooooooo choppy, I can't do anything. There are parts where it runs ok, like underneath in the crawl space in the first level. But anytime there's anything special on screen it runs at less than 1 fps. By the time I "wake up" from the choppyness I'm either dead or nearly dead from enemies. Anytime there's an enemy on the screen especially it's just crawling! 
<br /><br />I'm very intersted to know if anyone else is having the same problem. Doom 3 runs smooth as silk on my computer. Every game I run does. I even set the specs as low as I could get them and it still just crawled along. I couldn't get past the first level.
<br /><br />My PC is:
<br />P4 2.0 gig
<br />1 gig ram
<br />GeForce fx 5900 128 megs ram</div>

						<div class="postbody">Crylar, the only possible explanation is you don't have D3 patched properly to 1.3. The Wrong .dll API issue is that problem. Trying to run 1.3 gamecode with a 1.2 installation won't work.
<br /><br />The slowdowns people are getting from characters on screen is because this test release is aimed to test pushing characters using 2048x2048 texture maps down the pipe. That's why I say using a GeForce 6800 or equivalent or higher is recommended. That is D3's recommended card, and we're pushing just a little bit further using those texture sizes. This isn't on all surfaces, just the characters.
<br /><br />GeForce fx 5900 128 megs ram
<br /><br />That's not really going to perform well. Nothing against your card, but that's just how the mod is.</div>

						<div class="postbody">Maybe it's because it's late and I'm tired. Or maybe I'm just stupid but when you start in the first map, you can take two routes. Crawling beneath the rock to get to the broken elevator room or shoot the window and crawl down to end up in the water room. 
<br /><br />I did the last but after you jumped in the water there is no way of returning. This wouldn't be a problem but the door leading back to the beginning is locked [the one with the turret operation panel next to it]. Since I wasn't able to deactive the red lasers I figured I must have missed something, but after some searching it appeared the only way of getting back to the beginning was using "Noclip" to get through the door.
<br /><br />I didn't find anything special so how do you put the red lasers of ? I eventually used God mode to get through and I hate cheating.
<br /><br />Also the site mentions that the mod wouldn't be a clone, but this sure as hell looks and plays a lot like Quake 2 to me. I'd hoped to see brand new levels <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></div>

						<div class="postbody">Well it seems as though I've tracked down the source of my massive slowdowns. My video card's fan took a dump on me and I nearly burned up my card. Luckily I tracked down the problem soon enough and I've been able to keep it cool with a mini fan until I get ahold of the manufacturer to find out if it's covered under warrantee. My Trackmania is playing again, and this mod plays just fine. There's some choppyness to it, but that'll get hammered out by final release i'm sure.</div>

When the action is being pumped backwards the hand pulls the forearm away from the gun, resulting in a small, but noticeable, error.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img292.imageshack.us/my.php?image=shot000038lv.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img292.imageshack.us/img292/2669/shot000038lv.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />As for the alignment issues, it may be a matter of preference to particular players, I can't speak for anyone else, but in my opinion the shotgun feels most "right" in terms of how it is aligned, I have the easiest time aiming with it without a crosshair. In opposition to this the supershotgun draws a line farther to the left and considerably lower than the shotgun. I have spliced a picture of the shotgun and supershotgun together to demonstrate this.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img362.imageshack.us/my.php?image=splice6la.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img362.imageshack.us/img362/5333/splice6la.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />The machine gun has the same issue as the supershotgun, perhaps its not so much poor alignment as inconsistency which is making this so noticeable to me. If I weren't lazy I'd post pictures of the DooM 3 weapons.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img361.imageshack.us/my.php?image=splice27bx.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img361.imageshack.us/img361/8310/splice27bx.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>

Setting the damage to ten allows for mostly one shot kills against the light guards and also seems to speed up gameplay. This really is just personal preference, however, and can be ignored at will. If you would be so kind could you tell me whether or not what I'm doing, editing your mod, is welcome or not? In the meantime, I'm going to see if I can change D3's shotgun script to make it yet more to my liking (I'm very new to all this and the earlier mod to the D3 shotgun script and def file actually worked so I'm going to see if this new idea does as well).</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107895" date="Posted: Fri Aug 12, 2005 12:54 pm "><author>Crylar</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Kiltron wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">- WinXP SP2<br />- NVIDIA GeForce4 TI 4600<br />...<br />The TI 4600 isn't a recommended card for D3 itself, though it does run it.

Kiltron's site doesn't have a forum for discussing problems.
<br /><br />I'm really anxious to play this, but it is just soooooooo choppy, I can't do anything. There are parts where it runs ok, like underneath in the crawl space in the first level. But anytime there's anything special on screen it runs at less than 1 fps. By the time I "wake up" from the choppyness I'm either dead or nearly dead from enemies. Anytime there's an enemy on the screen especially it's just crawling! 
<br /><br />I'm very intersted to know if anyone else is having the same problem. Doom 3 runs smooth as silk on my computer. Every game I run does. I even set the specs as low as I could get them and it still just crawled along. I couldn't get past the first level.

The Wrong .dll API issue is that problem. Trying to run 1.3 gamecode with a 1.2 installation won't work.
<br /><br />The slowdowns people are getting from characters on screen is because this test release is aimed to test pushing characters using 2048x2048 texture maps down the pipe. That's why I say using a GeForce 6800 or equivalent or higher is recommended. That is D3's recommended card, and we're pushing just a little bit further using those texture sizes. This isn't on all surfaces, just the characters.
<br /><br />GeForce fx 5900 128 megs ram
<br /><br />That's not really going to perform well.

Or maybe I'm just stupid but when you start in the first map, you can take two routes. Crawling beneath the rock to get to the broken elevator room or shoot the window and crawl down to end up in the water room. 
<br /><br />I did the last but after you jumped in the water there is no way of returning. This wouldn't be a problem but the door leading back to the beginning is locked [the one with the turret operation panel next to it]. Since I wasn't able to deactive the red lasers I figured I must have missed something, but after some searching it appeared the only way of getting back to the beginning was using "Noclip" to get through the door.
<br /><br />I didn't find anything special so how do you put the red lasers of ? I eventually used God mode to get through and I hate cheating.
<br /><br />Also the site mentions that the mod wouldn't be a clone, but this sure as hell looks and plays a lot like Quake 2 to me. I'd hoped to see brand new levels <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p108089" date="Posted: Sat Aug 13, 2005 10:42 pm "><author>SilentSoD</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">*Spoilers*
<br /><br /><br />To turn off the lasers, when you reach the "water room" swim as far to the right as you can, go underwater, look around for a bit. There will be a room with lasers and a path around them to a control panel where you can turn off the lasers.
<br /><br />There's an easter egg in the room as well.

						<div class="postbody">Kiltron, hope you don't mind but I'm going to start this post with another error I saw, this time in the supershotgun pump animation. When the action is being pumped backwards the hand pulls the forearm away from the gun, resulting in a small, but noticeable, error.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img292.imageshack.us/my.php?image=shot000038lv.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img292.imageshack.us/img292/2669/shot000038lv.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />As for the alignment issues, it may be a matter of preference to particular players, I can't speak for anyone else, but in my opinion the shotgun feels most "right" in terms of how it is aligned, I have the easiest time aiming with it without a crosshair. In opposition to this the supershotgun draws a line farther to the left and considerably lower than the shotgun. I have spliced a picture of the shotgun and supershotgun together to demonstrate this.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img362.imageshack.us/my.php?image=splice6la.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img362.imageshack.us/img362/5333/splice6la.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />The machine gun has the same issue as the supershotgun, perhaps its not so much poor alignment as inconsistency which is making this so noticeable to me. If I weren't lazy I'd post pictures of the DooM 3 weapons.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img361.imageshack.us/my.php?image=splice27bx.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img361.imageshack.us/img361/8310/splice27bx.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />Hope this helps, I had a great time playing through this first test build. Thanks for your time and work.
<br /><br />Edited because I forget to remove particular words when I change grammar and thus sentences read oddly.</div>

						<div class="postbody">I also just made a new pk4 to see what a decent damage would be for the shotgun, don't think I'm going to mess with the other weapons right now. Setting the damage to ten allows for mostly one shot kills against the light guards and also seems to speed up gameplay. This really is just personal preference, however, and can be ignored at will. If you would be so kind could you tell me whether or not what I'm doing, editing your mod, is welcome or not? In the meantime, I'm going to see if I can change D3's shotgun script to make it yet more to my liking (I'm very new to all this and the earlier mod to the D3 shotgun script and def file actually worked so I'm going to see if this new idea does as well).</div>

						<div class="postbody">Ahh, I didn't see this forum about the mod. Kiltron's site doesn't have a forum for discussing problems.
<br /><br />I'm really anxious to play this, but it is just soooooooo choppy, I can't do anything. There are parts where it runs ok, like underneath in the crawl space in the first level. But anytime there's anything special on screen it runs at less than 1 fps. By the time I "wake up" from the choppyness I'm either dead or nearly dead from enemies. Anytime there's an enemy on the screen especially it's just crawling! 
<br /><br />I'm very intersted to know if anyone else is having the same problem. Doom 3 runs smooth as silk on my computer. Every game I run does. I even set the specs as low as I could get them and it still just crawled along. I couldn't get past the first level.
<br /><br />My PC is:
<br />P4 2.0 gig
<br />1 gig ram
<br />GeForce fx 5900 128 megs ram</div>

						<div class="postbody">Crylar, the only possible explanation is you don't have D3 patched properly to 1.3. The Wrong .dll API issue is that problem. Trying to run 1.3 gamecode with a 1.2 installation won't work.
<br /><br />The slowdowns people are getting from characters on screen is because this test release is aimed to test pushing characters using 2048x2048 texture maps down the pipe. That's why I say using a GeForce 6800 or equivalent or higher is recommended. That is D3's recommended card, and we're pushing just a little bit further using those texture sizes. This isn't on all surfaces, just the characters.
<br /><br />GeForce fx 5900 128 megs ram
<br /><br />That's not really going to perform well. Nothing against your card, but that's just how the mod is.</div>

						<div class="postbody">Maybe it's because it's late and I'm tired. Or maybe I'm just stupid but when you start in the first map, you can take two routes. Crawling beneath the rock to get to the broken elevator room or shoot the window and crawl down to end up in the water room. 
<br /><br />I did the last but after you jumped in the water there is no way of returning. This wouldn't be a problem but the door leading back to the beginning is locked [the one with the turret operation panel next to it]. Since I wasn't able to deactive the red lasers I figured I must have missed something, but after some searching it appeared the only way of getting back to the beginning was using "Noclip" to get through the door.
<br /><br />I didn't find anything special so how do you put the red lasers of ? I eventually used God mode to get through and I hate cheating.
<br /><br />Also the site mentions that the mod wouldn't be a clone, but this sure as hell looks and plays a lot like Quake 2 to me. I'd hoped to see brand new levels <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></div>

						<div class="postbody">Well it seems as though I've tracked down the source of my massive slowdowns. My video card's fan took a dump on me and I nearly burned up my card. Luckily I tracked down the problem soon enough and I've been able to keep it cool with a mini fan until I get ahold of the manufacturer to find out if it's covered under warrantee. My Trackmania is playing again, and this mod plays just fine. There's some choppyness to it, but that'll get hammered out by final release i'm sure.</div>

When the action is being pumped backwards the hand pulls the forearm away from the gun, resulting in a small, but noticeable, error.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img292.imageshack.us/my.php?image=shot000038lv.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img292.imageshack.us/img292/2669/shot000038lv.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />As for the alignment issues, it may be a matter of preference to particular players, I can't speak for anyone else, but in my opinion the shotgun feels most "right" in terms of how it is aligned, I have the easiest time aiming with it without a crosshair. In opposition to this the supershotgun draws a line farther to the left and considerably lower than the shotgun. I have spliced a picture of the shotgun and supershotgun together to demonstrate this.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img362.imageshack.us/my.php?image=splice6la.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img362.imageshack.us/img362/5333/splice6la.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />The machine gun has the same issue as the supershotgun, perhaps its not so much poor alignment as inconsistency which is making this so noticeable to me. If I weren't lazy I'd post pictures of the DooM 3 weapons.

In the meantime, I'm going to see if I can change D3's shotgun script to make it yet more to my liking (I'm very new to all this and the earlier mod to the D3 shotgun script and def file actually worked so I'm going to see if this new idea does as well).</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107895" date="Posted: Fri Aug 12, 2005 12:54 pm "><author>Crylar</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Kiltron wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">- WinXP SP2<br />- NVIDIA GeForce4 TI 4600<br />...<br />The TI 4600 isn't a recommended card for D3 itself, though it does run it.

<br /><br />I Get the same error with an other mod named shinyx wich pretty much just changes all textuers to some weird shader.
<br /><br />But plz halp me with this, I'm uber hot for this Q2 mod and need to try it.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107942" date="Posted: Fri Aug 12, 2005 7:06 pm "><author>SonicClang</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Ahh, I didn't see this forum about the mod. Kiltron's site doesn't have a forum for discussing problems.
<br /><br />I'm really anxious to play this, but it is just soooooooo choppy, I can't do anything. There are parts where it runs ok, like underneath in the crawl space in the first level. But anytime there's anything special on screen it runs at less than 1 fps. By the time I "wake up" from the choppyness I'm either dead or nearly dead from enemies. Anytime there's an enemy on the screen especially it's just crawling! 
<br /><br />I'm very intersted to know if anyone else is having the same problem. Doom 3 runs smooth as silk on my computer. Every game I run does. I even set the specs as low as I could get them and it still just crawled along. I couldn't get past the first level.

<br />1 gig ram

The Wrong .dll API issue is that problem. Trying to run 1.3 gamecode with a 1.2 installation won't work.
<br /><br />The slowdowns people are getting from characters on screen is because this test release is aimed to test pushing characters using 2048x2048 texture maps down the pipe. That's why I say using a GeForce 6800 or equivalent or higher is recommended. That is D3's recommended card, and we're pushing just a little bit further using those texture sizes. This isn't on all surfaces, just the characters.
<br /><br />GeForce fx 5900 128 megs ram
<br /><br />That's not really going to perform well. Nothing against your card, but that's just how the mod is.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107961" date="Posted: Fri Aug 12, 2005 9:17 pm "><author>Infernis</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">What about my problems Kiltron ?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107987" date="Posted: Sat Aug 13, 2005 12:51 am "><author>Kiltron</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">TheJugglah, can you post a copy of the console text that is printing when you get that error?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107991" date="Posted: Sat Aug 13, 2005 1:33 am "><author>SonicClang</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Kiltron, any plans on getting a lower poly version for people like me? ya know... the majority of people playing Doom 3.

Or maybe I'm just stupid but when you start in the first map, you can take two routes. Crawling beneath the rock to get to the broken elevator room or shoot the window and crawl down to end up in the water room. 
<br /><br />I did the last but after you jumped in the water there is no way of returning. This wouldn't be a problem but the door leading back to the beginning is locked [the one with the turret operation panel next to it]. Since I wasn't able to deactive the red lasers I figured I must have missed something, but after some searching it appeared the only way of getting back to the beginning was using "Noclip" to get through the door.
<br /><br />I didn't find anything special so how do you put the red lasers of ? I eventually used God mode to get through and I hate cheating.
<br /><br />Also the site mentions that the mod wouldn't be a clone, but this sure as hell looks and plays a lot like Quake 2 to me. I'd hoped to see brand new levels <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p108089" date="Posted: Sat Aug 13, 2005 10:42 pm "><author>SilentSoD</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">*Spoilers*
<br /><br /><br />To turn off the lasers, when you reach the "water room" swim as far to the right as you can, go underwater, look around for a bit. There will be a room with lasers and a path around them to a control panel where you can turn off the lasers.
<br /><br />There's an easter egg in the room as well.

						<div class="postbody">Kiltron, hope you don't mind but I'm going to start this post with another error I saw, this time in the supershotgun pump animation. When the action is being pumped backwards the hand pulls the forearm away from the gun, resulting in a small, but noticeable, error.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img292.imageshack.us/my.php?image=shot000038lv.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img292.imageshack.us/img292/2669/shot000038lv.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />As for the alignment issues, it may be a matter of preference to particular players, I can't speak for anyone else, but in my opinion the shotgun feels most "right" in terms of how it is aligned, I have the easiest time aiming with it without a crosshair. In opposition to this the supershotgun draws a line farther to the left and considerably lower than the shotgun. I have spliced a picture of the shotgun and supershotgun together to demonstrate this.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img362.imageshack.us/my.php?image=splice6la.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img362.imageshack.us/img362/5333/splice6la.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />The machine gun has the same issue as the supershotgun, perhaps its not so much poor alignment as inconsistency which is making this so noticeable to me. If I weren't lazy I'd post pictures of the DooM 3 weapons.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img361.imageshack.us/my.php?image=splice27bx.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img361.imageshack.us/img361/8310/splice27bx.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />Hope this helps, I had a great time playing through this first test build. Thanks for your time and work.
<br /><br />Edited because I forget to remove particular words when I change grammar and thus sentences read oddly.</div>

						<div class="postbody">I also just made a new pk4 to see what a decent damage would be for the shotgun, don't think I'm going to mess with the other weapons right now. Setting the damage to ten allows for mostly one shot kills against the light guards and also seems to speed up gameplay. This really is just personal preference, however, and can be ignored at will. If you would be so kind could you tell me whether or not what I'm doing, editing your mod, is welcome or not? In the meantime, I'm going to see if I can change D3's shotgun script to make it yet more to my liking (I'm very new to all this and the earlier mod to the D3 shotgun script and def file actually worked so I'm going to see if this new idea does as well).</div>

						<div class="postbody">Ahh, I didn't see this forum about the mod. Kiltron's site doesn't have a forum for discussing problems.
<br /><br />I'm really anxious to play this, but it is just soooooooo choppy, I can't do anything. There are parts where it runs ok, like underneath in the crawl space in the first level. But anytime there's anything special on screen it runs at less than 1 fps. By the time I "wake up" from the choppyness I'm either dead or nearly dead from enemies. Anytime there's an enemy on the screen especially it's just crawling! 
<br /><br />I'm very intersted to know if anyone else is having the same problem. Doom 3 runs smooth as silk on my computer. Every game I run does. I even set the specs as low as I could get them and it still just crawled along. I couldn't get past the first level.
<br /><br />My PC is:
<br />P4 2.0 gig
<br />1 gig ram
<br />GeForce fx 5900 128 megs ram</div>

						<div class="postbody">Crylar, the only possible explanation is you don't have D3 patched properly to 1.3. The Wrong .dll API issue is that problem. Trying to run 1.3 gamecode with a 1.2 installation won't work.
<br /><br />The slowdowns people are getting from characters on screen is because this test release is aimed to test pushing characters using 2048x2048 texture maps down the pipe. That's why I say using a GeForce 6800 or equivalent or higher is recommended. That is D3's recommended card, and we're pushing just a little bit further using those texture sizes. This isn't on all surfaces, just the characters.
<br /><br />GeForce fx 5900 128 megs ram
<br /><br />That's not really going to perform well. Nothing against your card, but that's just how the mod is.</div>

						<div class="postbody">Maybe it's because it's late and I'm tired. Or maybe I'm just stupid but when you start in the first map, you can take two routes. Crawling beneath the rock to get to the broken elevator room or shoot the window and crawl down to end up in the water room. 
<br /><br />I did the last but after you jumped in the water there is no way of returning. This wouldn't be a problem but the door leading back to the beginning is locked [the one with the turret operation panel next to it]. Since I wasn't able to deactive the red lasers I figured I must have missed something, but after some searching it appeared the only way of getting back to the beginning was using "Noclip" to get through the door.
<br /><br />I didn't find anything special so how do you put the red lasers of ? I eventually used God mode to get through and I hate cheating.
<br /><br />Also the site mentions that the mod wouldn't be a clone, but this sure as hell looks and plays a lot like Quake 2 to me. I'd hoped to see brand new levels <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></div>

						<div class="postbody">Well it seems as though I've tracked down the source of my massive slowdowns. My video card's fan took a dump on me and I nearly burned up my card. Luckily I tracked down the problem soon enough and I've been able to keep it cool with a mini fan until I get ahold of the manufacturer to find out if it's covered under warrantee. My Trackmania is playing again, and this mod plays just fine. There's some choppyness to it, but that'll get hammered out by final release i'm sure.</div>

When the action is being pumped backwards the hand pulls the forearm away from the gun, resulting in a small, but noticeable, error.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img292.imageshack.us/my.php?image=shot000038lv.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img292.imageshack.us/img292/2669/shot000038lv.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />As for the alignment issues, it may be a matter of preference to particular players, I can't speak for anyone else, but in my opinion the shotgun feels most "right" in terms of how it is aligned, I have the easiest time aiming with it without a crosshair. In opposition to this the supershotgun draws a line farther to the left and considerably lower than the shotgun. I have spliced a picture of the shotgun and supershotgun together to demonstrate this.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img362.imageshack.us/my.php?image=splice6la.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img362.imageshack.us/img362/5333/splice6la.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />The machine gun has the same issue as the supershotgun, perhaps its not so much poor alignment as inconsistency which is making this so noticeable to me. If I weren't lazy I'd post pictures of the DooM 3 weapons.

Setting the damage to ten allows for mostly one shot kills against the light guards and also seems to speed up gameplay. This really is just personal preference, however, and can be ignored at will. If you would be so kind could you tell me whether or not what I'm doing, editing your mod, is welcome or not? In the meantime, I'm going to see if I can change D3's shotgun script to make it yet more to my liking (I'm very new to all this and the earlier mod to the D3 shotgun script and def file actually worked so I'm going to see if this new idea does as well).</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107895" date="Posted: Fri Aug 12, 2005 12:54 pm "><author>Crylar</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Kiltron wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">- WinXP SP2<br />- NVIDIA GeForce4 TI 4600<br />...<br />The TI 4600 isn't a recommended card for D3 itself, though it does run it.

Kiltron's site doesn't have a forum for discussing problems.
<br /><br />I'm really anxious to play this, but it is just soooooooo choppy, I can't do anything. There are parts where it runs ok, like underneath in the crawl space in the first level. But anytime there's anything special on screen it runs at less than 1 fps. By the time I "wake up" from the choppyness I'm either dead or nearly dead from enemies. Anytime there's an enemy on the screen especially it's just crawling! 
<br /><br />I'm very intersted to know if anyone else is having the same problem. Doom 3 runs smooth as silk on my computer. Every game I run does. I even set the specs as low as I could get them and it still just crawled along. I couldn't get past the first level.

The Wrong .dll API issue is that problem. Trying to run 1.3 gamecode with a 1.2 installation won't work.
<br /><br />The slowdowns people are getting from characters on screen is because this test release is aimed to test pushing characters using 2048x2048 texture maps down the pipe. That's why I say using a GeForce 6800 or equivalent or higher is recommended. That is D3's recommended card, and we're pushing just a little bit further using those texture sizes. This isn't on all surfaces, just the characters.

Or maybe I'm just stupid but when you start in the first map, you can take two routes. Crawling beneath the rock to get to the broken elevator room or shoot the window and crawl down to end up in the water room. 
<br /><br />I did the last but after you jumped in the water there is no way of returning. This wouldn't be a problem but the door leading back to the beginning is locked [the one with the turret operation panel next to it]. Since I wasn't able to deactive the red lasers I figured I must have missed something, but after some searching it appeared the only way of getting back to the beginning was using "Noclip" to get through the door.
<br /><br />I didn't find anything special so how do you put the red lasers of ? I eventually used God mode to get through and I hate cheating.
<br /><br />Also the site mentions that the mod wouldn't be a clone, but this sure as hell looks and plays a lot like Quake 2 to me. I'd hoped to see brand new levels <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p108089" date="Posted: Sat Aug 13, 2005 10:42 pm "><author>SilentSoD</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">*Spoilers*
<br /><br /><br />To turn off the lasers, when you reach the "water room" swim as far to the right as you can, go underwater, look around for a bit. There will be a room with lasers and a path around them to a control panel where you can turn off the lasers.
<br /><br />There's an easter egg in the room as well.

						<div class="postbody">Kiltron, hope you don't mind but I'm going to start this post with another error I saw, this time in the supershotgun pump animation. When the action is being pumped backwards the hand pulls the forearm away from the gun, resulting in a small, but noticeable, error.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img292.imageshack.us/my.php?image=shot000038lv.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img292.imageshack.us/img292/2669/shot000038lv.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />As for the alignment issues, it may be a matter of preference to particular players, I can't speak for anyone else, but in my opinion the shotgun feels most "right" in terms of how it is aligned, I have the easiest time aiming with it without a crosshair. In opposition to this the supershotgun draws a line farther to the left and considerably lower than the shotgun. I have spliced a picture of the shotgun and supershotgun together to demonstrate this.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img362.imageshack.us/my.php?image=splice6la.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img362.imageshack.us/img362/5333/splice6la.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />The machine gun has the same issue as the supershotgun, perhaps its not so much poor alignment as inconsistency which is making this so noticeable to me. If I weren't lazy I'd post pictures of the DooM 3 weapons.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img361.imageshack.us/my.php?image=splice27bx.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img361.imageshack.us/img361/8310/splice27bx.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />Hope this helps, I had a great time playing through this first test build. Thanks for your time and work.
<br /><br />Edited because I forget to remove particular words when I change grammar and thus sentences read oddly.</div>

						<div class="postbody">I also just made a new pk4 to see what a decent damage would be for the shotgun, don't think I'm going to mess with the other weapons right now. Setting the damage to ten allows for mostly one shot kills against the light guards and also seems to speed up gameplay. This really is just personal preference, however, and can be ignored at will. If you would be so kind could you tell me whether or not what I'm doing, editing your mod, is welcome or not? In the meantime, I'm going to see if I can change D3's shotgun script to make it yet more to my liking (I'm very new to all this and the earlier mod to the D3 shotgun script and def file actually worked so I'm going to see if this new idea does as well).</div>

I pushed the bar with the engine and mod by using many 2048's so anything less than a GF6800 and 512RAM isn't suggested. I targeted high end systems. GF6800-7800 1024-2048RAM. The mod itself doesn't run poorly, it just requires steeper hardware specs.<br /><br />Crylar, updgrade D3 to the 1.3 Patch.</div>
<br />MY Doom3 is 1.3.1302 and up to date.
<br />My graphic card is RADEON 9800 XT
<br />I have 2 GB of RAM
<br />So that didn't help too much...
<br /><br />I Get the same error with an other mod named shinyx wich pretty much just changes all textuers to some weird shader.
<br /><br />But plz halp me with this, I'm uber hot for this Q2 mod and need to try it.</div>

						<div class="postbody">Ahh, I didn't see this forum about the mod. Kiltron's site doesn't have a forum for discussing problems.
<br /><br />I'm really anxious to play this, but it is just soooooooo choppy, I can't do anything. There are parts where it runs ok, like underneath in the crawl space in the first level. But anytime there's anything special on screen it runs at less than 1 fps. By the time I "wake up" from the choppyness I'm either dead or nearly dead from enemies. Anytime there's an enemy on the screen especially it's just crawling! 
<br /><br />I'm very intersted to know if anyone else is having the same problem. Doom 3 runs smooth as silk on my computer. Every game I run does. I even set the specs as low as I could get them and it still just crawled along. I couldn't get past the first level.
<br /><br />My PC is:
<br />P4 2.0 gig
<br />1 gig ram
<br />GeForce fx 5900 128 megs ram</div>

						<div class="postbody">Crylar, the only possible explanation is you don't have D3 patched properly to 1.3. The Wrong .dll API issue is that problem. Trying to run 1.3 gamecode with a 1.2 installation won't work.
<br /><br />The slowdowns people are getting from characters on screen is because this test release is aimed to test pushing characters using 2048x2048 texture maps down the pipe. That's why I say using a GeForce 6800 or equivalent or higher is recommended. That is D3's recommended card, and we're pushing just a little bit further using those texture sizes. This isn't on all surfaces, just the characters.
<br /><br />GeForce fx 5900 128 megs ram
<br /><br />That's not really going to perform well. Nothing against your card, but that's just how the mod is.</div>

						<div class="postbody">Maybe it's because it's late and I'm tired. Or maybe I'm just stupid but when you start in the first map, you can take two routes. Crawling beneath the rock to get to the broken elevator room or shoot the window and crawl down to end up in the water room. 
<br /><br />I did the last but after you jumped in the water there is no way of returning. This wouldn't be a problem but the door leading back to the beginning is locked [the one with the turret operation panel next to it]. Since I wasn't able to deactive the red lasers I figured I must have missed something, but after some searching it appeared the only way of getting back to the beginning was using "Noclip" to get through the door.
<br /><br />I didn't find anything special so how do you put the red lasers of ? I eventually used God mode to get through and I hate cheating.
<br /><br />Also the site mentions that the mod wouldn't be a clone, but this sure as hell looks and plays a lot like Quake 2 to me. I'd hoped to see brand new levels <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></div>

When the action is being pumped backwards the hand pulls the forearm away from the gun, resulting in a small, but noticeable, error.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img292.imageshack.us/my.php?image=shot000038lv.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img292.imageshack.us/img292/2669/shot000038lv.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />As for the alignment issues, it may be a matter of preference to particular players, I can't speak for anyone else, but in my opinion the shotgun feels most "right" in terms of how it is aligned, I have the easiest time aiming with it without a crosshair. In opposition to this the supershotgun draws a line farther to the left and considerably lower than the shotgun. I have spliced a picture of the shotgun and supershotgun together to demonstrate this.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img362.imageshack.us/my.php?image=splice6la.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img362.imageshack.us/img362/5333/splice6la.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />The machine gun has the same issue as the supershotgun, perhaps its not so much poor alignment as inconsistency which is making this so noticeable to me. If I weren't lazy I'd post pictures of the DooM 3 weapons.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img361.imageshack.us/my.php?image=splice27bx.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img361.imageshack.us/img361/8310/splice27bx.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>

Setting the damage to ten allows for mostly one shot kills against the light guards and also seems to speed up gameplay. This really is just personal preference, however, and can be ignored at will. If you would be so kind could you tell me whether or not what I'm doing, editing your mod, is welcome or not? In the meantime, I'm going to see if I can change D3's shotgun script to make it yet more to my liking (I'm very new to all this and the earlier mod to the D3 shotgun script and def file actually worked so I'm going to see if this new idea does as well).</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107895" date="Posted: Fri Aug 12, 2005 12:54 pm "><author>Crylar</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Kiltron wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">- WinXP SP2<br />- NVIDIA GeForce4 TI 4600<br />...<br />The TI 4600 isn't a recommended card for D3 itself, though it does run it.

Kiltron's site doesn't have a forum for discussing problems.
<br /><br />I'm really anxious to play this, but it is just soooooooo choppy, I can't do anything. There are parts where it runs ok, like underneath in the crawl space in the first level. But anytime there's anything special on screen it runs at less than 1 fps. By the time I "wake up" from the choppyness I'm either dead or nearly dead from enemies. Anytime there's an enemy on the screen especially it's just crawling! 
<br /><br />I'm very intersted to know if anyone else is having the same problem. Doom 3 runs smooth as silk on my computer. Every game I run does. I even set the specs as low as I could get them and it still just crawled along. I couldn't get past the first level.

The Wrong .dll API issue is that problem. Trying to run 1.3 gamecode with a 1.2 installation won't work.
<br /><br />The slowdowns people are getting from characters on screen is because this test release is aimed to test pushing characters using 2048x2048 texture maps down the pipe. That's why I say using a GeForce 6800 or equivalent or higher is recommended. That is D3's recommended card, and we're pushing just a little bit further using those texture sizes. This isn't on all surfaces, just the characters.

<br /><br />That's not really going to perform well.

Or maybe I'm just stupid but when you start in the first map, you can take two routes. Crawling beneath the rock to get to the broken elevator room or shoot the window and crawl down to end up in the water room. 
<br /><br />I did the last but after you jumped in the water there is no way of returning. This wouldn't be a problem but the door leading back to the beginning is locked [the one with the turret operation panel next to it]. Since I wasn't able to deactive the red lasers I figured I must have missed something, but after some searching it appeared the only way of getting back to the beginning was using "Noclip" to get through the door.
<br /><br />I didn't find anything special so how do you put the red lasers of ? I eventually used God mode to get through and I hate cheating.
<br /><br />Also the site mentions that the mod wouldn't be a clone, but this sure as hell looks and plays a lot like Quake 2 to me. I'd hoped to see brand new levels <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p108089" date="Posted: Sat Aug 13, 2005 10:42 pm "><author>SilentSoD</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">*Spoilers*
<br /><br /><br />To turn off the lasers, when you reach the "water room" swim as far to the right as you can, go underwater, look around for a bit. There will be a room with lasers and a path around them to a control panel where you can turn off the lasers.
<br /><br />There's an easter egg in the room as well.

						<div class="postbody">Kiltron, hope you don't mind but I'm going to start this post with another error I saw, this time in the supershotgun pump animation. When the action is being pumped backwards the hand pulls the forearm away from the gun, resulting in a small, but noticeable, error.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img292.imageshack.us/my.php?image=shot000038lv.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img292.imageshack.us/img292/2669/shot000038lv.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />As for the alignment issues, it may be a matter of preference to particular players, I can't speak for anyone else, but in my opinion the shotgun feels most "right" in terms of how it is aligned, I have the easiest time aiming with it without a crosshair. In opposition to this the supershotgun draws a line farther to the left and considerably lower than the shotgun. I have spliced a picture of the shotgun and supershotgun together to demonstrate this.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img362.imageshack.us/my.php?image=splice6la.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img362.imageshack.us/img362/5333/splice6la.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />The machine gun has the same issue as the supershotgun, perhaps its not so much poor alignment as inconsistency which is making this so noticeable to me. If I weren't lazy I'd post pictures of the DooM 3 weapons.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img361.imageshack.us/my.php?image=splice27bx.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img361.imageshack.us/img361/8310/splice27bx.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />Hope this helps, I had a great time playing through this first test build. Thanks for your time and work.
<br /><br />Edited because I forget to remove particular words when I change grammar and thus sentences read oddly.</div>

						<div class="postbody">I also just made a new pk4 to see what a decent damage would be for the shotgun, don't think I'm going to mess with the other weapons right now. Setting the damage to ten allows for mostly one shot kills against the light guards and also seems to speed up gameplay. This really is just personal preference, however, and can be ignored at will. If you would be so kind could you tell me whether or not what I'm doing, editing your mod, is welcome or not? In the meantime, I'm going to see if I can change D3's shotgun script to make it yet more to my liking (I'm very new to all this and the earlier mod to the D3 shotgun script and def file actually worked so I'm going to see if this new idea does as well).</div>

						<div class="postbody">Ahh, I didn't see this forum about the mod. Kiltron's site doesn't have a forum for discussing problems.
<br /><br />I'm really anxious to play this, but it is just soooooooo choppy, I can't do anything. There are parts where it runs ok, like underneath in the crawl space in the first level. But anytime there's anything special on screen it runs at less than 1 fps. By the time I "wake up" from the choppyness I'm either dead or nearly dead from enemies. Anytime there's an enemy on the screen especially it's just crawling! 
<br /><br />I'm very intersted to know if anyone else is having the same problem. Doom 3 runs smooth as silk on my computer. Every game I run does. I even set the specs as low as I could get them and it still just crawled along. I couldn't get past the first level.
<br /><br />My PC is:
<br />P4 2.0 gig
<br />1 gig ram
<br />GeForce fx 5900 128 megs ram</div>

						<div class="postbody">Crylar, the only possible explanation is you don't have D3 patched properly to 1.3. The Wrong .dll API issue is that problem. Trying to run 1.3 gamecode with a 1.2 installation won't work.
<br /><br />The slowdowns people are getting from characters on screen is because this test release is aimed to test pushing characters using 2048x2048 texture maps down the pipe. That's why I say using a GeForce 6800 or equivalent or higher is recommended. That is D3's recommended card, and we're pushing just a little bit further using those texture sizes. This isn't on all surfaces, just the characters.
<br /><br />GeForce fx 5900 128 megs ram
<br /><br />That's not really going to perform well. Nothing against your card, but that's just how the mod is.</div>

						<div class="postbody">Maybe it's because it's late and I'm tired. Or maybe I'm just stupid but when you start in the first map, you can take two routes. Crawling beneath the rock to get to the broken elevator room or shoot the window and crawl down to end up in the water room. 
<br /><br />I did the last but after you jumped in the water there is no way of returning. This wouldn't be a problem but the door leading back to the beginning is locked [the one with the turret operation panel next to it]. Since I wasn't able to deactive the red lasers I figured I must have missed something, but after some searching it appeared the only way of getting back to the beginning was using "Noclip" to get through the door.
<br /><br />I didn't find anything special so how do you put the red lasers of ? I eventually used God mode to get through and I hate cheating.
<br /><br />Also the site mentions that the mod wouldn't be a clone, but this sure as hell looks and plays a lot like Quake 2 to me. I'd hoped to see brand new levels <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></div>

<br /><br /><br />To turn off the lasers, when you reach the "water room" swim as far to the right as you can, go underwater, look around for a bit. There will be a room with lasers and a path around them to a control panel where you can turn off the lasers.

						<div class="postbody">Well it seems as though I've tracked down the source of my massive slowdowns. My video card's fan took a dump on me and I nearly burned up my card. Luckily I tracked down the problem soon enough and I've been able to keep it cool with a mini fan until I get ahold of the manufacturer to find out if it's covered under warrantee. My Trackmania is playing again, and this mod plays just fine. There's some choppyness to it, but that'll get hammered out by final release i'm sure.</div>

<br /><br />The second level actually runs pretty damn well except for the outside area.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p108087" date="Posted: Sat Aug 13, 2005 10:23 pm "><author>Infernis</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Maybe it's because it's late and I'm tired. Or maybe I'm just stupid but when you start in the first map, you can take two routes. Crawling beneath the rock to get to the broken elevator room or shoot the window and crawl down to end up in the water room. 
<br /><br />I did the last but after you jumped in the water there is no way of returning. This wouldn't be a problem but the door leading back to the beginning is locked [the one with the turret operation panel next to it]. Since I wasn't able to deactive the red lasers I figured I must have missed something, but after some searching it appeared the only way of getting back to the beginning was using "Noclip" to get through the door.
<br /><br />I didn't find anything special so how do you put the red lasers of ? I eventually used God mode to get through and I hate cheating.
<br /><br />Also the site mentions that the mod wouldn't be a clone, but this sure as hell looks and plays a lot like Quake 2 to me. I'd hoped to see brand new levels <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p108089" date="Posted: Sat Aug 13, 2005 10:42 pm "><author>SilentSoD</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">*Spoilers*
<br /><br /><br />To turn off the lasers, when you reach the "water room" swim as far to the right as you can, go underwater, look around for a bit. There will be a room with lasers and a path around them to a control panel where you can turn off the lasers.
<br /><br />There's an easter egg in the room as well.

But I'm referring to the lasers in the last room of the map. Where you take the lift down to the next level. How do you turn those of ?
<br /><br />I take it there is no way to open the door near the turret control computer ?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p108185" date="Posted: Sun Aug 14, 2005 8:37 pm "><author>rcumps01</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Kiltron wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">The slowdowns people are getting from characters on screen is because this test release is aimed to test pushing characters using 2048x2048 texture maps down the pipe.</div>Just like to point out that using that size texture is ridiculous for ingame models right now.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p108187" date="Posted: Sun Aug 14, 2005 8:56 pm "><author>SonicClang</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Well it seems as though I've tracked down the source of my massive slowdowns.

						<div class="postbody">Kiltron, hope you don't mind but I'm going to start this post with another error I saw, this time in the supershotgun pump animation. When the action is being pumped backwards the hand pulls the forearm away from the gun, resulting in a small, but noticeable, error.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img292.imageshack.us/my.php?image=shot000038lv.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img292.imageshack.us/img292/2669/shot000038lv.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />As for the alignment issues, it may be a matter of preference to particular players, I can't speak for anyone else, but in my opinion the shotgun feels most "right" in terms of how it is aligned, I have the easiest time aiming with it without a crosshair. In opposition to this the supershotgun draws a line farther to the left and considerably lower than the shotgun. I have spliced a picture of the shotgun and supershotgun together to demonstrate this.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img362.imageshack.us/my.php?image=splice6la.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img362.imageshack.us/img362/5333/splice6la.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />The machine gun has the same issue as the supershotgun, perhaps its not so much poor alignment as inconsistency which is making this so noticeable to me. If I weren't lazy I'd post pictures of the DooM 3 weapons.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img361.imageshack.us/my.php?image=splice27bx.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img361.imageshack.us/img361/8310/splice27bx.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />Hope this helps, I had a great time playing through this first test build. Thanks for your time and work.
<br /><br />Edited because I forget to remove particular words when I change grammar and thus sentences read oddly.</div>

						<div class="postbody">I also just made a new pk4 to see what a decent damage would be for the shotgun, don't think I'm going to mess with the other weapons right now. Setting the damage to ten allows for mostly one shot kills against the light guards and also seems to speed up gameplay. This really is just personal preference, however, and can be ignored at will. If you would be so kind could you tell me whether or not what I'm doing, editing your mod, is welcome or not? In the meantime, I'm going to see if I can change D3's shotgun script to make it yet more to my liking (I'm very new to all this and the earlier mod to the D3 shotgun script and def file actually worked so I'm going to see if this new idea does as well).</div>

I pushed the bar with the engine and mod by using many 2048's so anything less than a GF6800 and 512RAM isn't suggested. I targeted high end systems. GF6800-7800 1024-2048RAM. The mod itself doesn't run poorly, it just requires steeper hardware specs.<br /><br />Crylar, updgrade D3 to the 1.3 Patch.</div>
<br />MY Doom3 is 1.3.1302 and up to date.
<br />My graphic card is RADEON 9800 XT
<br />I have 2 GB of RAM
<br />So that didn't help too much...
<br /><br />I Get the same error with an other mod named shinyx wich pretty much just changes all textuers to some weird shader.
<br /><br />But plz halp me with this, I'm uber hot for this Q2 mod and need to try it.</div>

						<div class="postbody">Ahh, I didn't see this forum about the mod. Kiltron's site doesn't have a forum for discussing problems.
<br /><br />I'm really anxious to play this, but it is just soooooooo choppy, I can't do anything. There are parts where it runs ok, like underneath in the crawl space in the first level. But anytime there's anything special on screen it runs at less than 1 fps. By the time I "wake up" from the choppyness I'm either dead or nearly dead from enemies. Anytime there's an enemy on the screen especially it's just crawling! 
<br /><br />I'm very intersted to know if anyone else is having the same problem. Doom 3 runs smooth as silk on my computer. Every game I run does. I even set the specs as low as I could get them and it still just crawled along. I couldn't get past the first level.
<br /><br />My PC is:
<br />P4 2.0 gig
<br />1 gig ram
<br />GeForce fx 5900 128 megs ram</div>

						<div class="postbody">Crylar, the only possible explanation is you don't have D3 patched properly to 1.3. The Wrong .dll API issue is that problem. Trying to run 1.3 gamecode with a 1.2 installation won't work.
<br /><br />The slowdowns people are getting from characters on screen is because this test release is aimed to test pushing characters using 2048x2048 texture maps down the pipe. That's why I say using a GeForce 6800 or equivalent or higher is recommended. That is D3's recommended card, and we're pushing just a little bit further using those texture sizes. This isn't on all surfaces, just the characters.
<br /><br />GeForce fx 5900 128 megs ram
<br /><br />That's not really going to perform well. Nothing against your card, but that's just how the mod is.</div>

						<div class="postbody">Maybe it's because it's late and I'm tired. Or maybe I'm just stupid but when you start in the first map, you can take two routes. Crawling beneath the rock to get to the broken elevator room or shoot the window and crawl down to end up in the water room. 
<br /><br />I did the last but after you jumped in the water there is no way of returning. This wouldn't be a problem but the door leading back to the beginning is locked [the one with the turret operation panel next to it]. Since I wasn't able to deactive the red lasers I figured I must have missed something, but after some searching it appeared the only way of getting back to the beginning was using "Noclip" to get through the door.
<br /><br />I didn't find anything special so how do you put the red lasers of ? I eventually used God mode to get through and I hate cheating.
<br /><br />Also the site mentions that the mod wouldn't be a clone, but this sure as hell looks and plays a lot like Quake 2 to me. I'd hoped to see brand new levels <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></div>

When the action is being pumped backwards the hand pulls the forearm away from the gun, resulting in a small, but noticeable, error.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img292.imageshack.us/my.php?image=shot000038lv.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img292.imageshack.us/img292/2669/shot000038lv.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />As for the alignment issues, it may be a matter of preference to particular players, I can't speak for anyone else, but in my opinion the shotgun feels most "right" in terms of how it is aligned, I have the easiest time aiming with it without a crosshair. In opposition to this the supershotgun draws a line farther to the left and considerably lower than the shotgun. I have spliced a picture of the shotgun and supershotgun together to demonstrate this.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img362.imageshack.us/my.php?image=splice6la.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img362.imageshack.us/img362/5333/splice6la.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />The machine gun has the same issue as the supershotgun, perhaps its not so much poor alignment as inconsistency which is making this so noticeable to me. If I weren't lazy I'd post pictures of the DooM 3 weapons.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img361.imageshack.us/my.php?image=splice27bx.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img361.imageshack.us/img361/8310/splice27bx.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>

Setting the damage to ten allows for mostly one shot kills against the light guards and also seems to speed up gameplay. This really is just personal preference, however, and can be ignored at will. If you would be so kind could you tell me whether or not what I'm doing, editing your mod, is welcome or not? In the meantime, I'm going to see if I can change D3's shotgun script to make it yet more to my liking (I'm very new to all this and the earlier mod to the D3 shotgun script and def file actually worked so I'm going to see if this new idea does as well).</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107895" date="Posted: Fri Aug 12, 2005 12:54 pm "><author>Crylar</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Kiltron wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">- WinXP SP2<br />- NVIDIA GeForce4 TI 4600<br />...<br />The TI 4600 isn't a recommended card for D3 itself, though it does run it.

Kiltron's site doesn't have a forum for discussing problems.
<br /><br />I'm really anxious to play this, but it is just soooooooo choppy, I can't do anything. There are parts where it runs ok, like underneath in the crawl space in the first level. But anytime there's anything special on screen it runs at less than 1 fps. By the time I "wake up" from the choppyness I'm either dead or nearly dead from enemies. Anytime there's an enemy on the screen especially it's just crawling! 
<br /><br />I'm very intersted to know if anyone else is having the same problem. Doom 3 runs smooth as silk on my computer. Every game I run does. I even set the specs as low as I could get them and it still just crawled along. I couldn't get past the first level.

The Wrong .dll API issue is that problem. Trying to run 1.3 gamecode with a 1.2 installation won't work.
<br /><br />The slowdowns people are getting from characters on screen is because this test release is aimed to test pushing characters using 2048x2048 texture maps down the pipe. That's why I say using a GeForce 6800 or equivalent or higher is recommended. That is D3's recommended card, and we're pushing just a little bit further using those texture sizes. This isn't on all surfaces, just the characters.

Or maybe I'm just stupid but when you start in the first map, you can take two routes. Crawling beneath the rock to get to the broken elevator room or shoot the window and crawl down to end up in the water room. 
<br /><br />I did the last but after you jumped in the water there is no way of returning. This wouldn't be a problem but the door leading back to the beginning is locked [the one with the turret operation panel next to it]. Since I wasn't able to deactive the red lasers I figured I must have missed something, but after some searching it appeared the only way of getting back to the beginning was using "Noclip" to get through the door.
<br /><br />I didn't find anything special so how do you put the red lasers of ? I eventually used God mode to get through and I hate cheating.
<br /><br />Also the site mentions that the mod wouldn't be a clone, but this sure as hell looks and plays a lot like Quake 2 to me. I'd hoped to see brand new levels <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p108089" date="Posted: Sat Aug 13, 2005 10:42 pm "><author>SilentSoD</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">*Spoilers*
<br /><br /><br />To turn off the lasers, when you reach the "water room" swim as far to the right as you can, go underwater, look around for a bit. There will be a room with lasers and a path around them to a control panel where you can turn off the lasers.
<br /><br />There's an easter egg in the room as well.

						<div class="postbody">Kiltron, hope you don't mind but I'm going to start this post with another error I saw, this time in the supershotgun pump animation. When the action is being pumped backwards the hand pulls the forearm away from the gun, resulting in a small, but noticeable, error.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img292.imageshack.us/my.php?image=shot000038lv.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img292.imageshack.us/img292/2669/shot000038lv.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />As for the alignment issues, it may be a matter of preference to particular players, I can't speak for anyone else, but in my opinion the shotgun feels most "right" in terms of how it is aligned, I have the easiest time aiming with it without a crosshair. In opposition to this the supershotgun draws a line farther to the left and considerably lower than the shotgun. I have spliced a picture of the shotgun and supershotgun together to demonstrate this.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img362.imageshack.us/my.php?image=splice6la.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img362.imageshack.us/img362/5333/splice6la.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />The machine gun has the same issue as the supershotgun, perhaps its not so much poor alignment as inconsistency which is making this so noticeable to me. If I weren't lazy I'd post pictures of the DooM 3 weapons.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img361.imageshack.us/my.php?image=splice27bx.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img361.imageshack.us/img361/8310/splice27bx.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />Hope this helps, I had a great time playing through this first test build. Thanks for your time and work.
<br /><br />Edited because I forget to remove particular words when I change grammar and thus sentences read oddly.</div>

						<div class="postbody">I also just made a new pk4 to see what a decent damage would be for the shotgun, don't think I'm going to mess with the other weapons right now. Setting the damage to ten allows for mostly one shot kills against the light guards and also seems to speed up gameplay. This really is just personal preference, however, and can be ignored at will. If you would be so kind could you tell me whether or not what I'm doing, editing your mod, is welcome or not? In the meantime, I'm going to see if I can change D3's shotgun script to make it yet more to my liking (I'm very new to all this and the earlier mod to the D3 shotgun script and def file actually worked so I'm going to see if this new idea does as well).</div>

						<div class="postbody">Ahh, I didn't see this forum about the mod. Kiltron's site doesn't have a forum for discussing problems.
<br /><br />I'm really anxious to play this, but it is just soooooooo choppy, I can't do anything. There are parts where it runs ok, like underneath in the crawl space in the first level. But anytime there's anything special on screen it runs at less than 1 fps. By the time I "wake up" from the choppyness I'm either dead or nearly dead from enemies. Anytime there's an enemy on the screen especially it's just crawling! 
<br /><br />I'm very intersted to know if anyone else is having the same problem. Doom 3 runs smooth as silk on my computer. Every game I run does. I even set the specs as low as I could get them and it still just crawled along. I couldn't get past the first level.
<br /><br />My PC is:
<br />P4 2.0 gig
<br />1 gig ram
<br />GeForce fx 5900 128 megs ram</div>

						<div class="postbody">Crylar, the only possible explanation is you don't have D3 patched properly to 1.3. The Wrong .dll API issue is that problem. Trying to run 1.3 gamecode with a 1.2 installation won't work.
<br /><br />The slowdowns people are getting from characters on screen is because this test release is aimed to test pushing characters using 2048x2048 texture maps down the pipe. That's why I say using a GeForce 6800 or equivalent or higher is recommended. That is D3's recommended card, and we're pushing just a little bit further using those texture sizes. This isn't on all surfaces, just the characters.
<br /><br />GeForce fx 5900 128 megs ram
<br /><br />That's not really going to perform well. Nothing against your card, but that's just how the mod is.</div>

						<div class="postbody">Maybe it's because it's late and I'm tired. Or maybe I'm just stupid but when you start in the first map, you can take two routes. Crawling beneath the rock to get to the broken elevator room or shoot the window and crawl down to end up in the water room. 
<br /><br />I did the last but after you jumped in the water there is no way of returning. This wouldn't be a problem but the door leading back to the beginning is locked [the one with the turret operation panel next to it]. Since I wasn't able to deactive the red lasers I figured I must have missed something, but after some searching it appeared the only way of getting back to the beginning was using "Noclip" to get through the door.
<br /><br />I didn't find anything special so how do you put the red lasers of ? I eventually used God mode to get through and I hate cheating.
<br /><br />Also the site mentions that the mod wouldn't be a clone, but this sure as hell looks and plays a lot like Quake 2 to me. I'd hoped to see brand new levels <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></div>

						<div class="postbody">Well it seems as though I've tracked down the source of my massive slowdowns. My video card's fan took a dump on me and I nearly burned up my card. Luckily I tracked down the problem soon enough and I've been able to keep it cool with a mini fan until I get ahold of the manufacturer to find out if it's covered under warrantee. My Trackmania is playing again, and this mod plays just fine. There's some choppyness to it, but that'll get hammered out by final release i'm sure.</div>

When the action is being pumped backwards the hand pulls the forearm away from the gun, resulting in a small, but noticeable, error.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img292.imageshack.us/my.php?image=shot000038lv.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img292.imageshack.us/img292/2669/shot000038lv.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />As for the alignment issues, it may be a matter of preference to particular players, I can't speak for anyone else, but in my opinion the shotgun feels most "right" in terms of how it is aligned, I have the easiest time aiming with it without a crosshair. In opposition to this the supershotgun draws a line farther to the left and considerably lower than the shotgun. I have spliced a picture of the shotgun and supershotgun together to demonstrate this.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img362.imageshack.us/my.php?image=splice6la.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img362.imageshack.us/img362/5333/splice6la.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />The machine gun has the same issue as the supershotgun, perhaps its not so much poor alignment as inconsistency which is making this so noticeable to me. If I weren't lazy I'd post pictures of the DooM 3 weapons.

Setting the damage to ten allows for mostly one shot kills against the light guards and also seems to speed up gameplay. This really is just personal preference, however, and can be ignored at will. If you would be so kind could you tell me whether or not what I'm doing, editing your mod, is welcome or not? In the meantime, I'm going to see if I can change D3's shotgun script to make it yet more to my liking (I'm very new to all this and the earlier mod to the D3 shotgun script and def file actually worked so I'm going to see if this new idea does as well).</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107895" date="Posted: Fri Aug 12, 2005 12:54 pm "><author>Crylar</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Kiltron wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">- WinXP SP2<br />- NVIDIA GeForce4 TI 4600<br />...<br />The TI 4600 isn't a recommended card for D3 itself, though it does run it.

Kiltron's site doesn't have a forum for discussing problems.
<br /><br />I'm really anxious to play this, but it is just soooooooo choppy, I can't do anything. There are parts where it runs ok, like underneath in the crawl space in the first level. But anytime there's anything special on screen it runs at less than 1 fps. By the time I "wake up" from the choppyness I'm either dead or nearly dead from enemies. Anytime there's an enemy on the screen especially it's just crawling! 
<br /><br />I'm very intersted to know if anyone else is having the same problem. Doom 3 runs smooth as silk on my computer. Every game I run does. I even set the specs as low as I could get them and it still just crawled along. I couldn't get past the first level.

The Wrong .dll API issue is that problem. Trying to run 1.3 gamecode with a 1.2 installation won't work.
<br /><br />The slowdowns people are getting from characters on screen is because this test release is aimed to test pushing characters using 2048x2048 texture maps down the pipe. That's why I say using a GeForce 6800 or equivalent or higher is recommended. That is D3's recommended card, and we're pushing just a little bit further using those texture sizes. This isn't on all surfaces, just the characters.
<br /><br />GeForce fx 5900 128 megs ram
<br /><br />That's not really going to perform well.

Or maybe I'm just stupid but when you start in the first map, you can take two routes. Crawling beneath the rock to get to the broken elevator room or shoot the window and crawl down to end up in the water room. 
<br /><br />I did the last but after you jumped in the water there is no way of returning. This wouldn't be a problem but the door leading back to the beginning is locked [the one with the turret operation panel next to it]. Since I wasn't able to deactive the red lasers I figured I must have missed something, but after some searching it appeared the only way of getting back to the beginning was using "Noclip" to get through the door.
<br /><br />I didn't find anything special so how do you put the red lasers of ? I eventually used God mode to get through and I hate cheating.
<br /><br />Also the site mentions that the mod wouldn't be a clone, but this sure as hell looks and plays a lot like Quake 2 to me. I'd hoped to see brand new levels <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p108089" date="Posted: Sat Aug 13, 2005 10:42 pm "><author>SilentSoD</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">*Spoilers*
<br /><br /><br />To turn off the lasers, when you reach the "water room" swim as far to the right as you can, go underwater, look around for a bit. There will be a room with lasers and a path around them to a control panel where you can turn off the lasers.
<br /><br />There's an easter egg in the room as well.

						<div class="postbody">Kiltron, hope you don't mind but I'm going to start this post with another error I saw, this time in the supershotgun pump animation. When the action is being pumped backwards the hand pulls the forearm away from the gun, resulting in a small, but noticeable, error.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img292.imageshack.us/my.php?image=shot000038lv.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img292.imageshack.us/img292/2669/shot000038lv.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />As for the alignment issues, it may be a matter of preference to particular players, I can't speak for anyone else, but in my opinion the shotgun feels most "right" in terms of how it is aligned, I have the easiest time aiming with it without a crosshair. In opposition to this the supershotgun draws a line farther to the left and considerably lower than the shotgun. I have spliced a picture of the shotgun and supershotgun together to demonstrate this.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img362.imageshack.us/my.php?image=splice6la.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img362.imageshack.us/img362/5333/splice6la.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />The machine gun has the same issue as the supershotgun, perhaps its not so much poor alignment as inconsistency which is making this so noticeable to me. If I weren't lazy I'd post pictures of the DooM 3 weapons.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img361.imageshack.us/my.php?image=splice27bx.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img361.imageshack.us/img361/8310/splice27bx.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />Hope this helps, I had a great time playing through this first test build. Thanks for your time and work.
<br /><br />Edited because I forget to remove particular words when I change grammar and thus sentences read oddly.</div>

						<div class="postbody">I also just made a new pk4 to see what a decent damage would be for the shotgun, don't think I'm going to mess with the other weapons right now. Setting the damage to ten allows for mostly one shot kills against the light guards and also seems to speed up gameplay. This really is just personal preference, however, and can be ignored at will. If you would be so kind could you tell me whether or not what I'm doing, editing your mod, is welcome or not? In the meantime, I'm going to see if I can change D3's shotgun script to make it yet more to my liking (I'm very new to all this and the earlier mod to the D3 shotgun script and def file actually worked so I'm going to see if this new idea does as well).</div>

						<div class="postbody">Ahh, I didn't see this forum about the mod. Kiltron's site doesn't have a forum for discussing problems.
<br /><br />I'm really anxious to play this, but it is just soooooooo choppy, I can't do anything. There are parts where it runs ok, like underneath in the crawl space in the first level. But anytime there's anything special on screen it runs at less than 1 fps. By the time I "wake up" from the choppyness I'm either dead or nearly dead from enemies. Anytime there's an enemy on the screen especially it's just crawling! 
<br /><br />I'm very intersted to know if anyone else is having the same problem. Doom 3 runs smooth as silk on my computer. Every game I run does. I even set the specs as low as I could get them and it still just crawled along. I couldn't get past the first level.
<br /><br />My PC is:
<br />P4 2.0 gig
<br />1 gig ram
<br />GeForce fx 5900 128 megs ram</div>

						<div class="postbody">Crylar, the only possible explanation is you don't have D3 patched properly to 1.3. The Wrong .dll API issue is that problem. Trying to run 1.3 gamecode with a 1.2 installation won't work.
<br /><br />The slowdowns people are getting from characters on screen is because this test release is aimed to test pushing characters using 2048x2048 texture maps down the pipe. That's why I say using a GeForce 6800 or equivalent or higher is recommended. That is D3's recommended card, and we're pushing just a little bit further using those texture sizes. This isn't on all surfaces, just the characters.
<br /><br />GeForce fx 5900 128 megs ram
<br /><br />That's not really going to perform well. Nothing against your card, but that's just how the mod is.</div>

						<div class="postbody">Maybe it's because it's late and I'm tired. Or maybe I'm just stupid but when you start in the first map, you can take two routes. Crawling beneath the rock to get to the broken elevator room or shoot the window and crawl down to end up in the water room. 
<br /><br />I did the last but after you jumped in the water there is no way of returning. This wouldn't be a problem but the door leading back to the beginning is locked [the one with the turret operation panel next to it]. Since I wasn't able to deactive the red lasers I figured I must have missed something, but after some searching it appeared the only way of getting back to the beginning was using "Noclip" to get through the door.
<br /><br />I didn't find anything special so how do you put the red lasers of ? I eventually used God mode to get through and I hate cheating.
<br /><br />Also the site mentions that the mod wouldn't be a clone, but this sure as hell looks and plays a lot like Quake 2 to me. I'd hoped to see brand new levels <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></div>

						<div class="postbody">Well it seems as though I've tracked down the source of my massive slowdowns. My video card's fan took a dump on me and I nearly burned up my card. Luckily I tracked down the problem soon enough and I've been able to keep it cool with a mini fan until I get ahold of the manufacturer to find out if it's covered under warrantee. My Trackmania is playing again, and this mod plays just fine. There's some choppyness to it, but that'll get hammered out by final release i'm sure.</div>

When the action is being pumped backwards the hand pulls the forearm away from the gun, resulting in a small, but noticeable, error.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img292.imageshack.us/my.php?image=shot000038lv.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img292.imageshack.us/img292/2669/shot000038lv.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />As for the alignment issues, it may be a matter of preference to particular players, I can't speak for anyone else, but in my opinion the shotgun feels most "right" in terms of how it is aligned, I have the easiest time aiming with it without a crosshair. In opposition to this the supershotgun draws a line farther to the left and considerably lower than the shotgun. I have spliced a picture of the shotgun and supershotgun together to demonstrate this.

<br /><br />The machine gun has the same issue as the supershotgun, perhaps its not so much poor alignment as inconsistency which is making this so noticeable to me. If I weren't lazy I'd post pictures of the DooM 3 weapons.

<br /><br />Hope this helps, I had a great time playing through this first test build. Thanks for your time and work.

Setting the damage to ten allows for mostly one shot kills against the light guards and also seems to speed up gameplay. This really is just personal preference, however, and can be ignored at will. If you would be so kind could you tell me whether or not what I'm doing, editing your mod, is welcome or not? In the meantime, I'm going to see if I can change D3's shotgun script to make it yet more to my liking (I'm very new to all this and the earlier mod to the D3 shotgun script and def file actually worked so I'm going to see if this new idea does as well).</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107895" date="Posted: Fri Aug 12, 2005 12:54 pm "><author>Crylar</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Kiltron wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">- WinXP SP2<br />- NVIDIA GeForce4 TI 4600<br />...<br />The TI 4600 isn't a recommended card for D3 itself, though it does run it.

Kiltron's site doesn't have a forum for discussing problems.
<br /><br />I'm really anxious to play this, but it is just soooooooo choppy, I can't do anything. There are parts where it runs ok, like underneath in the crawl space in the first level. But anytime there's anything special on screen it runs at less than 1 fps. By the time I "wake up" from the choppyness I'm either dead or nearly dead from enemies. Anytime there's an enemy on the screen especially it's just crawling! 
<br /><br />I'm very intersted to know if anyone else is having the same problem. Doom 3 runs smooth as silk on my computer. Every game I run does. I even set the specs as low as I could get them and it still just crawled along. I couldn't get past the first level.

The Wrong .dll API issue is that problem. Trying to run 1.3 gamecode with a 1.2 installation won't work.
<br /><br />The slowdowns people are getting from characters on screen is because this test release is aimed to test pushing characters using 2048x2048 texture maps down the pipe. That's why I say using a GeForce 6800 or equivalent or higher is recommended. That is D3's recommended card, and we're pushing just a little bit further using those texture sizes. This isn't on all surfaces, just the characters.
<br /><br />GeForce fx 5900 128 megs ram
<br /><br />That's not really going to perform well.

Or maybe I'm just stupid but when you start in the first map, you can take two routes. Crawling beneath the rock to get to the broken elevator room or shoot the window and crawl down to end up in the water room. 
<br /><br />I did the last but after you jumped in the water there is no way of returning. This wouldn't be a problem but the door leading back to the beginning is locked [the one with the turret operation panel next to it]. Since I wasn't able to deactive the red lasers I figured I must have missed something, but after some searching it appeared the only way of getting back to the beginning was using "Noclip" to get through the door.
<br /><br />I didn't find anything special so how do you put the red lasers of ? I eventually used God mode to get through and I hate cheating.
<br /><br />Also the site mentions that the mod wouldn't be a clone, but this sure as hell looks and plays a lot like Quake 2 to me. I'd hoped to see brand new levels <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p108089" date="Posted: Sat Aug 13, 2005 10:42 pm "><author>SilentSoD</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">*Spoilers*
<br /><br /><br />To turn off the lasers, when you reach the "water room" swim as far to the right as you can, go underwater, look around for a bit. There will be a room with lasers and a path around them to a control panel where you can turn off the lasers.
<br /><br />There's an easter egg in the room as well.

						<div class="postbody">Kiltron, hope you don't mind but I'm going to start this post with another error I saw, this time in the supershotgun pump animation. When the action is being pumped backwards the hand pulls the forearm away from the gun, resulting in a small, but noticeable, error.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img292.imageshack.us/my.php?image=shot000038lv.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img292.imageshack.us/img292/2669/shot000038lv.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />As for the alignment issues, it may be a matter of preference to particular players, I can't speak for anyone else, but in my opinion the shotgun feels most "right" in terms of how it is aligned, I have the easiest time aiming with it without a crosshair. In opposition to this the supershotgun draws a line farther to the left and considerably lower than the shotgun. I have spliced a picture of the shotgun and supershotgun together to demonstrate this.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img362.imageshack.us/my.php?image=splice6la.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img362.imageshack.us/img362/5333/splice6la.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />The machine gun has the same issue as the supershotgun, perhaps its not so much poor alignment as inconsistency which is making this so noticeable to me. If I weren't lazy I'd post pictures of the DooM 3 weapons.

<br /><br />Hope this helps, I had a great time playing through this first test build. Thanks for your time and work.
<br /><br />Edited because I forget to remove particular words when I change grammar and thus sentences read oddly.</div>

						<div class="postbody">I also just made a new pk4 to see what a decent damage would be for the shotgun, don't think I'm going to mess with the other weapons right now. Setting the damage to ten allows for mostly one shot kills against the light guards and also seems to speed up gameplay. This really is just personal preference, however, and can be ignored at will. If you would be so kind could you tell me whether or not what I'm doing, editing your mod, is welcome or not? In the meantime, I'm going to see if I can change D3's shotgun script to make it yet more to my liking (I'm very new to all this and the earlier mod to the D3 shotgun script and def file actually worked so I'm going to see if this new idea does as well).</div>

						<div class="postbody">Ahh, I didn't see this forum about the mod. Kiltron's site doesn't have a forum for discussing problems.
<br /><br />I'm really anxious to play this, but it is just soooooooo choppy, I can't do anything. There are parts where it runs ok, like underneath in the crawl space in the first level. But anytime there's anything special on screen it runs at less than 1 fps. By the time I "wake up" from the choppyness I'm either dead or nearly dead from enemies. Anytime there's an enemy on the screen especially it's just crawling! 
<br /><br />I'm very intersted to know if anyone else is having the same problem. Doom 3 runs smooth as silk on my computer. Every game I run does. I even set the specs as low as I could get them and it still just crawled along. I couldn't get past the first level.
<br /><br />My PC is:
<br />P4 2.0 gig
<br />1 gig ram
<br />GeForce fx 5900 128 megs ram</div>

						<div class="postbody">Crylar, the only possible explanation is you don't have D3 patched properly to 1.3. The Wrong .dll API issue is that problem. Trying to run 1.3 gamecode with a 1.2 installation won't work.
<br /><br />The slowdowns people are getting from characters on screen is because this test release is aimed to test pushing characters using 2048x2048 texture maps down the pipe. That's why I say using a GeForce 6800 or equivalent or higher is recommended. That is D3's recommended card, and we're pushing just a little bit further using those texture sizes. This isn't on all surfaces, just the characters.

<br /><br />That's not really going to perform well. Nothing against your card, but that's just how the mod is.</div>

						<div class="postbody">Maybe it's because it's late and I'm tired. Or maybe I'm just stupid but when you start in the first map, you can take two routes. Crawling beneath the rock to get to the broken elevator room or shoot the window and crawl down to end up in the water room. 
<br /><br />I did the last but after you jumped in the water there is no way of returning. This wouldn't be a problem but the door leading back to the beginning is locked [the one with the turret operation panel next to it]. Since I wasn't able to deactive the red lasers I figured I must have missed something, but after some searching it appeared the only way of getting back to the beginning was using "Noclip" to get through the door.
<br /><br />I didn't find anything special so how do you put the red lasers of ? I eventually used God mode to get through and I hate cheating.
<br /><br />Also the site mentions that the mod wouldn't be a clone, but this sure as hell looks and plays a lot like Quake 2 to me. I'd hoped to see brand new levels <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></div>

						<div class="postbody">Well it seems as though I've tracked down the source of my massive slowdowns. My video card's fan took a dump on me and I nearly burned up my card. Luckily I tracked down the problem soon enough and I've been able to keep it cool with a mini fan until I get ahold of the manufacturer to find out if it's covered under warrantee. My Trackmania is playing again, and this mod plays just fine. There's some choppyness to it, but that'll get hammered out by final release i'm sure.</div>

When the action is being pumped backwards the hand pulls the forearm away from the gun, resulting in a small, but noticeable, error.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img292.imageshack.us/my.php?image=shot000038lv.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img292.imageshack.us/img292/2669/shot000038lv.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />As for the alignment issues, it may be a matter of preference to particular players, I can't speak for anyone else, but in my opinion the shotgun feels most "right" in terms of how it is aligned, I have the easiest time aiming with it without a crosshair. In opposition to this the supershotgun draws a line farther to the left and considerably lower than the shotgun. I have spliced a picture of the shotgun and supershotgun together to demonstrate this.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img362.imageshack.us/my.php?image=splice6la.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img362.imageshack.us/img362/5333/splice6la.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />The machine gun has the same issue as the supershotgun, perhaps its not so much poor alignment as inconsistency which is making this so noticeable to me. If I weren't lazy I'd post pictures of the DooM 3 weapons.

Setting the damage to ten allows for mostly one shot kills against the light guards and also seems to speed up gameplay. This really is just personal preference, however, and can be ignored at will. If you would be so kind could you tell me whether or not what I'm doing, editing your mod, is welcome or not? In the meantime, I'm going to see if I can change D3's shotgun script to make it yet more to my liking (I'm very new to all this and the earlier mod to the D3 shotgun script and def file actually worked so I'm going to see if this new idea does as well).</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107895" date="Posted: Fri Aug 12, 2005 12:54 pm "><author>Crylar</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Kiltron wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">- WinXP SP2<br />- NVIDIA GeForce4 TI 4600<br />...<br />The TI 4600 isn't a recommended card for D3 itself, though it does run it.

Kiltron's site doesn't have a forum for discussing problems.
<br /><br />I'm really anxious to play this, but it is just soooooooo choppy, I can't do anything. There are parts where it runs ok, like underneath in the crawl space in the first level. But anytime there's anything special on screen it runs at less than 1 fps. By the time I "wake up" from the choppyness I'm either dead or nearly dead from enemies. Anytime there's an enemy on the screen especially it's just crawling! 
<br /><br />I'm very intersted to know if anyone else is having the same problem. Doom 3 runs smooth as silk on my computer. Every game I run does. I even set the specs as low as I could get them and it still just crawled along. I couldn't get past the first level.

The Wrong .dll API issue is that problem. Trying to run 1.3 gamecode with a 1.2 installation won't work.
<br /><br />The slowdowns people are getting from characters on screen is because this test release is aimed to test pushing characters using 2048x2048 texture maps down the pipe. That's why I say using a GeForce 6800 or equivalent or higher is recommended. That is D3's recommended card, and we're pushing just a little bit further using those texture sizes. This isn't on all surfaces, just the characters.

Or maybe I'm just stupid but when you start in the first map, you can take two routes. Crawling beneath the rock to get to the broken elevator room or shoot the window and crawl down to end up in the water room. 
<br /><br />I did the last but after you jumped in the water there is no way of returning. This wouldn't be a problem but the door leading back to the beginning is locked [the one with the turret operation panel next to it]. Since I wasn't able to deactive the red lasers I figured I must have missed something, but after some searching it appeared the only way of getting back to the beginning was using "Noclip" to get through the door.
<br /><br />I didn't find anything special so how do you put the red lasers of ? I eventually used God mode to get through and I hate cheating.
<br /><br />Also the site mentions that the mod wouldn't be a clone, but this sure as hell looks and plays a lot like Quake 2 to me. I'd hoped to see brand new levels <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p108089" date="Posted: Sat Aug 13, 2005 10:42 pm "><author>SilentSoD</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">*Spoilers*
<br /><br /><br />To turn off the lasers, when you reach the "water room" swim as far to the right as you can, go underwater, look around for a bit. There will be a room with lasers and a path around them to a control panel where you can turn off the lasers.
<br /><br />There's an easter egg in the room as well.

						<div class="postbody">Kiltron, hope you don't mind but I'm going to start this post with another error I saw, this time in the supershotgun pump animation. When the action is being pumped backwards the hand pulls the forearm away from the gun, resulting in a small, but noticeable, error.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img292.imageshack.us/my.php?image=shot000038lv.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img292.imageshack.us/img292/2669/shot000038lv.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />As for the alignment issues, it may be a matter of preference to particular players, I can't speak for anyone else, but in my opinion the shotgun feels most "right" in terms of how it is aligned, I have the easiest time aiming with it without a crosshair. In opposition to this the supershotgun draws a line farther to the left and considerably lower than the shotgun. I have spliced a picture of the shotgun and supershotgun together to demonstrate this.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img362.imageshack.us/my.php?image=splice6la.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img362.imageshack.us/img362/5333/splice6la.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />The machine gun has the same issue as the supershotgun, perhaps its not so much poor alignment as inconsistency which is making this so noticeable to me. If I weren't lazy I'd post pictures of the DooM 3 weapons.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img361.imageshack.us/my.php?image=splice27bx.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img361.imageshack.us/img361/8310/splice27bx.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />Hope this helps, I had a great time playing through this first test build. Thanks for your time and work.
<br /><br />Edited because I forget to remove particular words when I change grammar and thus sentences read oddly.</div>

						<div class="postbody">I also just made a new pk4 to see what a decent damage would be for the shotgun, don't think I'm going to mess with the other weapons right now. Setting the damage to ten allows for mostly one shot kills against the light guards and also seems to speed up gameplay. This really is just personal preference, however, and can be ignored at will. If you would be so kind could you tell me whether or not what I'm doing, editing your mod, is welcome or not? In the meantime, I'm going to see if I can change D3's shotgun script to make it yet more to my liking (I'm very new to all this and the earlier mod to the D3 shotgun script and def file actually worked so I'm going to see if this new idea does as well).</div>

						<div class="postbody">Ahh, I didn't see this forum about the mod. Kiltron's site doesn't have a forum for discussing problems.
<br /><br />I'm really anxious to play this, but it is just soooooooo choppy, I can't do anything. There are parts where it runs ok, like underneath in the crawl space in the first level. But anytime there's anything special on screen it runs at less than 1 fps. By the time I "wake up" from the choppyness I'm either dead or nearly dead from enemies. Anytime there's an enemy on the screen especially it's just crawling! 
<br /><br />I'm very intersted to know if anyone else is having the same problem. Doom 3 runs smooth as silk on my computer. Every game I run does. I even set the specs as low as I could get them and it still just crawled along. I couldn't get past the first level.
<br /><br />My PC is:
<br />P4 2.0 gig
<br />1 gig ram
<br />GeForce fx 5900 128 megs ram</div>

						<div class="postbody">Crylar, the only possible explanation is you don't have D3 patched properly to 1.3. The Wrong .dll API issue is that problem. Trying to run 1.3 gamecode with a 1.2 installation won't work.
<br /><br />The slowdowns people are getting from characters on screen is because this test release is aimed to test pushing characters using 2048x2048 texture maps down the pipe. That's why I say using a GeForce 6800 or equivalent or higher is recommended. That is D3's recommended card, and we're pushing just a little bit further using those texture sizes. This isn't on all surfaces, just the characters.
<br /><br />GeForce fx 5900 128 megs ram
<br /><br />That's not really going to perform well. Nothing against your card, but that's just how the mod is.</div>

						<div class="postbody">Maybe it's because it's late and I'm tired. Or maybe I'm just stupid but when you start in the first map, you can take two routes. Crawling beneath the rock to get to the broken elevator room or shoot the window and crawl down to end up in the water room. 
<br /><br />I did the last but after you jumped in the water there is no way of returning. This wouldn't be a problem but the door leading back to the beginning is locked [the one with the turret operation panel next to it]. Since I wasn't able to deactive the red lasers I figured I must have missed something, but after some searching it appeared the only way of getting back to the beginning was using "Noclip" to get through the door.
<br /><br />I didn't find anything special so how do you put the red lasers of ? I eventually used God mode to get through and I hate cheating.
<br /><br />Also the site mentions that the mod wouldn't be a clone, but this sure as hell looks and plays a lot like Quake 2 to me.

When the action is being pumped backwards the hand pulls the forearm away from the gun, resulting in a small, but noticeable, error.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img292.imageshack.us/my.php?image=shot000038lv.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img292.imageshack.us/img292/2669/shot000038lv.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />As for the alignment issues, it may be a matter of preference to particular players, I can't speak for anyone else, but in my opinion the shotgun feels most "right" in terms of how it is aligned, I have the easiest time aiming with it without a crosshair. In opposition to this the supershotgun draws a line farther to the left and considerably lower than the shotgun. I have spliced a picture of the shotgun and supershotgun together to demonstrate this.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img362.imageshack.us/my.php?image=splice6la.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img362.imageshack.us/img362/5333/splice6la.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />The machine gun has the same issue as the supershotgun, perhaps its not so much poor alignment as inconsistency which is making this so noticeable to me. If I weren't lazy I'd post pictures of the DooM 3 weapons.

Setting the damage to ten allows for mostly one shot kills against the light guards and also seems to speed up gameplay. This really is just personal preference, however, and can be ignored at will. If you would be so kind could you tell me whether or not what I'm doing, editing your mod, is welcome or not? In the meantime, I'm going to see if I can change D3's shotgun script to make it yet more to my liking (I'm very new to all this and the earlier mod to the D3 shotgun script and def file actually worked so I'm going to see if this new idea does as well).</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107895" date="Posted: Fri Aug 12, 2005 12:54 pm "><author>Crylar</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Kiltron wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">- WinXP SP2<br />- NVIDIA GeForce4 TI 4600<br />...<br />The TI 4600 isn't a recommended card for D3 itself, though it does run it.

Kiltron's site doesn't have a forum for discussing problems.
<br /><br />I'm really anxious to play this, but it is just soooooooo choppy, I can't do anything. There are parts where it runs ok, like underneath in the crawl space in the first level. But anytime there's anything special on screen it runs at less than 1 fps. By the time I "wake up" from the choppyness I'm either dead or nearly dead from enemies. Anytime there's an enemy on the screen especially it's just crawling! 
<br /><br />I'm very intersted to know if anyone else is having the same problem. Doom 3 runs smooth as silk on my computer. Every game I run does. I even set the specs as low as I could get them and it still just crawled along. I couldn't get past the first level.

The Wrong .dll API issue is that problem. Trying to run 1.3 gamecode with a 1.2 installation won't work.
<br /><br />The slowdowns people are getting from characters on screen is because this test release is aimed to test pushing characters using 2048x2048 texture maps down the pipe. That's why I say using a GeForce 6800 or equivalent or higher is recommended. That is D3's recommended card, and we're pushing just a little bit further using those texture sizes. This isn't on all surfaces, just the characters.

Or maybe I'm just stupid but when you start in the first map, you can take two routes. Crawling beneath the rock to get to the broken elevator room or shoot the window and crawl down to end up in the water room. 
<br /><br />I did the last but after you jumped in the water there is no way of returning. This wouldn't be a problem but the door leading back to the beginning is locked [the one with the turret operation panel next to it]. Since I wasn't able to deactive the red lasers I figured I must have missed something, but after some searching it appeared the only way of getting back to the beginning was using "Noclip" to get through the door.
<br /><br />I didn't find anything special so how do you put the red lasers of ? I eventually used God mode to get through and I hate cheating.
<br /><br />Also the site mentions that the mod wouldn't be a clone, but this sure as hell looks and plays a lot like Quake 2 to me. I'd hoped to see brand new levels <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p108089" date="Posted: Sat Aug 13, 2005 10:42 pm "><author>SilentSoD</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">*Spoilers*
<br /><br /><br />To turn off the lasers, when you reach the "water room" swim as far to the right as you can, go underwater, look around for a bit. There will be a room with lasers and a path around them to a control panel where you can turn off the lasers.
<br /><br />There's an easter egg in the room as well.

						<div class="postbody">Kiltron, hope you don't mind but I'm going to start this post with another error I saw, this time in the supershotgun pump animation. When the action is being pumped backwards the hand pulls the forearm away from the gun, resulting in a small, but noticeable, error.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img292.imageshack.us/my.php?image=shot000038lv.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img292.imageshack.us/img292/2669/shot000038lv.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />As for the alignment issues, it may be a matter of preference to particular players, I can't speak for anyone else, but in my opinion the shotgun feels most "right" in terms of how it is aligned, I have the easiest time aiming with it without a crosshair. In opposition to this the supershotgun draws a line farther to the left and considerably lower than the shotgun. I have spliced a picture of the shotgun and supershotgun together to demonstrate this.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img362.imageshack.us/my.php?image=splice6la.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img362.imageshack.us/img362/5333/splice6la.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />The machine gun has the same issue as the supershotgun, perhaps its not so much poor alignment as inconsistency which is making this so noticeable to me. If I weren't lazy I'd post pictures of the DooM 3 weapons.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img361.imageshack.us/my.php?image=splice27bx.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img361.imageshack.us/img361/8310/splice27bx.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />Hope this helps, I had a great time playing through this first test build. Thanks for your time and work.
<br /><br />Edited because I forget to remove particular words when I change grammar and thus sentences read oddly.</div>

						<div class="postbody">I also just made a new pk4 to see what a decent damage would be for the shotgun, don't think I'm going to mess with the other weapons right now. Setting the damage to ten allows for mostly one shot kills against the light guards and also seems to speed up gameplay. This really is just personal preference, however, and can be ignored at will. If you would be so kind could you tell me whether or not what I'm doing, editing your mod, is welcome or not? In the meantime, I'm going to see if I can change D3's shotgun script to make it yet more to my liking (I'm very new to all this and the earlier mod to the D3 shotgun script and def file actually worked so I'm going to see if this new idea does as well).</div>

						<div class="postbody">Ahh, I didn't see this forum about the mod. Kiltron's site doesn't have a forum for discussing problems.
<br /><br />I'm really anxious to play this, but it is just soooooooo choppy, I can't do anything. There are parts where it runs ok, like underneath in the crawl space in the first level. But anytime there's anything special on screen it runs at less than 1 fps. By the time I "wake up" from the choppyness I'm either dead or nearly dead from enemies. Anytime there's an enemy on the screen especially it's just crawling! 
<br /><br />I'm very intersted to know if anyone else is having the same problem. Doom 3 runs smooth as silk on my computer. Every game I run does. I even set the specs as low as I could get them and it still just crawled along. I couldn't get past the first level.
<br /><br />My PC is:
<br />P4 2.0 gig
<br />1 gig ram
<br />GeForce fx 5900 128 megs ram</div>

						<div class="postbody">Crylar, the only possible explanation is you don't have D3 patched properly to 1.3. The Wrong .dll API issue is that problem. Trying to run 1.3 gamecode with a 1.2 installation won't work.
<br /><br />The slowdowns people are getting from characters on screen is because this test release is aimed to test pushing characters using 2048x2048 texture maps down the pipe. That's why I say using a GeForce 6800 or equivalent or higher is recommended. That is D3's recommended card, and we're pushing just a little bit further using those texture sizes. This isn't on all surfaces, just the characters.
<br /><br />GeForce fx 5900 128 megs ram
<br /><br />That's not really going to perform well. Nothing against your card, but that's just how the mod is.</div>

						<div class="postbody">Maybe it's because it's late and I'm tired. Or maybe I'm just stupid but when you start in the first map, you can take two routes. Crawling beneath the rock to get to the broken elevator room or shoot the window and crawl down to end up in the water room. 
<br /><br />I did the last but after you jumped in the water there is no way of returning. This wouldn't be a problem but the door leading back to the beginning is locked [the one with the turret operation panel next to it]. Since I wasn't able to deactive the red lasers I figured I must have missed something, but after some searching it appeared the only way of getting back to the beginning was using "Noclip" to get through the door.
<br /><br />I didn't find anything special so how do you put the red lasers of ? I eventually used God mode to get through and I hate cheating.
<br /><br />Also the site mentions that the mod wouldn't be a clone, but this sure as hell looks and plays a lot like Quake 2 to me. I'd hoped to see brand new levels <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></div>

<br /><br /><br />To turn off the lasers, when you reach the "water room" swim as far to the right as you can, go underwater, look around for a bit. There will be a room with lasers and a path around them to a control panel where you can turn off the lasers.

						<div class="postbody">Well it seems as though I've tracked down the source of my massive slowdowns. My video card's fan took a dump on me and I nearly burned up my card. Luckily I tracked down the problem soon enough and I've been able to keep it cool with a mini fan until I get ahold of the manufacturer to find out if it's covered under warrantee. My Trackmania is playing again, and this mod plays just fine. There's some choppyness to it, but that'll get hammered out by final release i'm sure.</div>

Most of my feedback has already been stated by the others, but I'll quickly recap/summarize mine:&#13;
<br/><br/>
The enforcers glide like ice skaters. Very graceful!&#13;
<br/><br/>
Enemies with too much health. Hard to kill off what should be cannonfodder.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Dropships that shoot at me! The game is already tough enough on Normal!&#13;
<br/><br/>
Not enough health.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Saving and loading don't work on the Main Menu.&#13;
<br/><br/>
The chaingun guys are weird-looking. I liked them when they were comically short and stalky. I called them George, after George Castanza from Seinfeld.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Sound effects aren't very high-quality. Try shooting for Doom 3 sound quality as much as you can.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Needs better voice acting. Couldn't stop laughing at the "Intruder Alert" sound. Everyone kinda slurs as they make noise.&#13;
<br/><br/>
No crosshair. I can't aim by myself worth a damn. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0"/><br/><br/>
On to the good comments.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Map design is excellent. My specs are P4 2.8 Ghz, GeForce 6600gt, and 1.5GB RAM. I noticed a bit of chopiness, but I don't see that as bad. Clearly, you're looking towards the future of gaming by pushing this engine's limits. Half of the responsibility goes into the mapper's optimization techniques while the other half is for the gamers to keep their PCs upgraded for the games they want.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Weapons look nice. (Shotgun could have slightly faster rate-of-fire, though)&#13;
<br/><br/>
Some music was good.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Keep up the good work, Kiltron and Crew.<br/>_________________<br/>December 10, 1993: A Date to Remember Forever.</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

(though most of it was personal opinons and reiterations of what's mentioned on the website and in the readme.txt)&#13;
<br/><br/>
Next build we be even better. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0"/></span><span class="gensmall"/></td>
