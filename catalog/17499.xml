Or are they only available for models?</div>
<br /><br />Doom3 supports if I remember correct all DXT variations (DXT 1, DXT 3, and DXT 5).
<br /><br />If you have Photoshop you should try NVIDIA texture plug-inn. With this plug-inn you can choose various compression methods for dds. Personally, I’m using for my diffuse textures, DXT 5, for specular DXT 5 or sometimes but very rare RGB 888 24bit and for lights always RGB 888 24bit method, because I’d like to keep smooth transition between colors. Although, the size of RGB 888 24bit is just a bit smaller than the original TGA texture.
<br /><br />These parameters are of course very relative. All depends from your texturing needs and your desire how much quality picture you’d like to have at the end. 
<br /><br />And one more thing, try to find some dds viewer, so that you can easily compare quality of yours dds textures with the original TGA.
<br /><br />As for the problem which you have in the game with dds textures, you should know one thing.
<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">textures/wall/001<br />{<br />    qer_editorimage  textures/editor.jpg       // custom DOOMEdit material preview image<br />    diffusemap       textures/wall/001_d.tga        // color and value information for the material<br />    specularmap      textures/wall/001_s.tga        // specular highlights<br />    bumpmap          textures/wall/001_local.tga    // normalmap for bumpmapped appearance<br />}</div>
<br /><br /> This is the basic code part for textures; you certainly don’t need to add anything else, except dds textures which should be placed in this case in the next folder:
<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Doom3/base/dds/textures/wall/001_d.dds</span>
<br /><br /><br />So check again where yours dds textures are placed!
<br /><br />If you have again the same issue, then you probably have the problem with the program which you using for creating dds textures.
