It's simple once you understand how it works.
<br /><br />I don't even know what you expect to be a "point and click" design?  You think there are editors out there where you just click a "MAKE ROOM LOOK GOOD NOW PLZ" button?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p180513" date="Posted: Mon Jun 11, 2007 10:22 am "><author>pope</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">try <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.lego.com/en-US/default.aspx" class="postlink">here</a></div>]]></body></post><post id="p180514" date="Posted: Mon Jun 11, 2007 10:52 am "><author>Rayne</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">pickleok777 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I need something like gtk rad. but less confusing and not so laggy like a ponit and click</div>

<br />And there's plenty of tutorials on this website to make you familiar with it.
<br /><br />There's also an engine with level editor called Cube, that's even easier ,but just for that single game (unless you code it otherwise) i think.
<br /><br />For Doom I'd recommend just taking time to read alot of tutorials and maybe watch explenatory videos.
<br /><br />Everyone here capable of bringing out half decent maps have spent alot of time learning to do so, level design isn't as simple as you might think.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p180522" date="Posted: Mon Jun 11, 2007 11:52 am "><author>Kristus</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Building with blocks is HARD.

<br /><br />If you want easy, work on an older engine. Like Duke3d or Doom.
<br /><br />Or better yet, Wolf3d or ROTT. :p</div>]]></body></post><post id="p180523" date="Posted: Mon Jun 11, 2007 12:04 pm "><author>Junkyard God</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Afraid i never got to fidle too much with doom 1 and or duke3d, pretty much started out on worldcraft ^^</div>]]></body></post><post id="p180525" date="Posted: Mon Jun 11, 2007 12:09 pm "><author>Kamikazee</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Kristus wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Building with blocks is HARD.</div>That's not true all the time, it is actually easier once you want to do complex stuff.

<br /><br />So what's stopping you from trying now? Both the Doom and Duke3d communities are very much alive and kicking.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p180529" date="Posted: Mon Jun 11, 2007 12:35 pm "><author>Junkyard God</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">That's not such a bad idea to be honest <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Have any links perhaps?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p180532" date="Posted: Mon Jun 11, 2007 12:50 pm "><author>Kristus</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Heh, sure:
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doomworld.com/">http://www.doomworld.com</a><!-- m --> - The biggest and oldest living community site for Doom. Including lists of sourceports, utilities like editors.
<br /><br />Also featuring an /idgames archive script that lets you find, rate and download the plethora of projects housed by the /idgames archive.
<br /><br />That's really all you need to get started. You should be able to find your way from there.
<br /><br />Other examples of community sites are: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.newdoom.com/">http://www.newdoom.com</a><!-- m --> and drdteam.org. Although IMO doomworld is where it's at. :p
<br /><br />As the Doom community is rather broad, there's naturally a lot of different community portals. Most of them are rather niched though. And you'll probably find what you're looking for fairly soon.
<br /><br />One thing to remember is that the forums on DW, can be rather brisk if you're not careful. Asking redundant questions as opposed to doing any research yourself, is usually rather unappreciated by the denizens. (I know, I'm one of them. :p) This is however not the case for the community at large. It's very dependant on what website/forum you're visiting.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p180535" date="Posted: Mon Jun 11, 2007 1:06 pm "><author>Junkyard God</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks alot <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> I'll give all those links a quick peek here at work and see what I can do <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p180537" date="Posted: Mon Jun 11, 2007 1:10 pm "><author>Kamikazee</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Kristus wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Kamikaze: Your sarcasm detector must be broken.</div>No, I'm just so old-fashioned that I don't have one.
