<br /><br />3D Photo Browser is a file explorer that makes viewing, editing, and organizing your 3D files (LightWave, DirectX, Max, Maya, STL...), images (+60 formats supported), videos and audio files easier.

<br /><br />Depending on the running version it includes advanced tools such:
<br />- 3D batch processing
<br />- 3D interactive and batchable scenes optimization (polygon reduction with
<br />Polygon Cruncher)
<br />- Image and 3d file conversions
<br />- Complete screen capture, contact sheet printing, html exportation
<br />- File documentation and advanced search based on criterias (ie. exif)
