<br /><br />ajm113: The "flying guy" is the Wizard or Scrag from Quake. As you may or may not know these are all old Quake monsters.
<br /><br />ratty redemption: Not really sure what to say about the toes..  hahahaa..  it really wasn't something that came to my attention at all until now. I can see what you mean and maybe I'll come up with a reason.. like hhmmm.. I'm too lazy to change hehee.
<br /><br />Tron: Yeah, the fur.. something that I decided against right in the beginning of making the Shambler. I think just about everyone commented on that, but as it stands, the engine can't do decent fur to my liking, so it's just not in there at all. I'm not a fan of the "bump mapped" fur, it looks too much like clay.
<br /><br />As for the fiend, I'm sure they have eyes, or rather what looks like eyes to me anyway. If they didn't.. then.. they do now..  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225085409im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p168392" date="Posted: Thu Jan 25, 2007 3:08 pm "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">obihb, hehe fair enough <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225085409im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />I also agree with leaving fur out until the engine can do it convincing enough.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p168458" date="Posted: Fri Jan 26, 2007 8:39 pm "><author>dsm</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">6th Venom wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Damn!

<br />Go play the Hell map in Doom 3 - there's a part where it's got a bunch of burnt, skeletal zombies - there's your Quake zombies. That's basically what Quake's zombies look like in a modern 3d engine.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225085409im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225085409/http://img63.imageshack.us/my.php?image=hellzombie01nu8.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225085409im_/http://img63.imageshack.us/img63/2963/hellzombie01nu8.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br /><br />Oooh, a new Scrag (or Wizard)! /Me likes a lot
<br /><br />The Shambler I don't really dig entirely (although it's a great model you've done there). The original had what looked like bloody hoofs, and its muscles weren't as pronounced. I think I read in an interview with John Romero that the Shambler was supposed to have fur or something.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p167011" date="Posted: Wed Jan 10, 2007 11:20 am "><author>obihb</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Even since before starting on the Wolfenstein stuff, I started to make this model, a high poly version of it.

<br /><br />The screens obviously being from within Doom but the animation rendered in Max with high poly displaced model.
<br /><br />EagleFlyfree: Yes, it'll have range attack. Pretty much similar to the Quake Vore.

<br /><br />ajm113: The "flying guy" is the Wizard or Scrag from Quake. As you may or may not know these are all old Quake monsters.
<br /><br />ratty redemption: Not really sure what to say about the toes..  hahahaa..  it really wasn't something that came to my attention at all until now. I can see what you mean and maybe I'll come up with a reason.. like hhmmm.. I'm too lazy to change hehee.
<br /><br />Tron: Yeah, the fur.. something that I decided against right in the beginning of making the Shambler. I think just about everyone commented on that, but as it stands, the engine can't do decent fur to my liking, so it's just not in there at all. I'm not a fan of the "bump mapped" fur, it looks too much like clay.
<br /><br />As for the fiend, I'm sure they have eyes, or rather what looks like eyes to me anyway. If they didn't.. then.. they do now..  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225085839im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p168392" date="Posted: Thu Jan 25, 2007 3:08 pm "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">obihb, hehe fair enough <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225085839im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />I also agree with leaving fur out until the engine can do it convincing enough.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p168458" date="Posted: Fri Jan 26, 2007 8:39 pm "><author>dsm</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">6th Venom wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Damn!

<br />Go play the Hell map in Doom 3 - there's a part where it's got a bunch of burnt, skeletal zombies - there's your Quake zombies.

<br /><br /><br />Oooh, a new Scrag (or Wizard)! /Me likes a lot
<br /><br />The Shambler I don't really dig entirely (although it's a great model you've done there). The original had what looked like bloody hoofs, and its muscles weren't as pronounced. I think I read in an interview with John Romero that the Shambler was supposed to have fur or something.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p167011" date="Posted: Wed Jan 10, 2007 10:20 am "><author>obihb</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Even since before starting on the Wolfenstein stuff, I started to make this model, a high poly version of it.
