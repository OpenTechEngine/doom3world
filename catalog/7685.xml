<br /><br />First, there are some missing textures:

<br /><br />What's the deal with these?
<br /><br />Second, there is a big ass building in the middle of the square that's not in your screenshot. I'm not sure what the idea was but it's in a bad spot and it blocks the view of the column.

<br /><br />Do you have a reference picture for that build?
<br /><br />I ask because there is a interesting build to the left of the museum ( block1 ) but I'm not sure which it is on the map, either 7 or 4 I suppose.
<br /><br />This is the build I was thinking of "St Martin-in-the-Fields"

<br /><br />That's somewhere between 4 and 7, however, since the city map is not adhering exactly to Trafalgar sq. it ended being off. I've done about 1/4 of my block and I didn't take the church into account. Someone who's doing the 4th might though.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p66284" date="Posted: Sun Dec 05, 2004 3:12 am "><author>idiom</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">The building and roads weren't made from any pictures from trafalgar square.

And no, we don't need to see work/a resume or any of that.  This is a community project and people contribute whatever they can, whenever they can.  
<br /><br />While there might be some overall "quality" goals that we strive to meet for the project, we have folks that are veteran mappers and folks that are just starting out.  Personally, I've noticed that anyone who is uncertain about their modding skills will quickly find that just by taking part in the community here, their work will improve in quality.  
<br /><br />That said, as soon as we hear back from Dante_uk regarding Block 10a (he wanted to work on it and one point, so I want to check with him first), we'll know if we have an opening.  Also, there may be some folks who haven't replied to me yet whose real lives are a bit too busy and they need a break from the project.  If that's the case, I'll post here or edit the first post with any openings.  
<br /><br />And, of course, mapping is only a fraction of what goes into the project.  If you'd like to help in any other way, just post about it and go for it.  Some of the things I know we're short of off the top of my head are:
<br /><br />static models... 
<br />animated models/characters...
<br />textures/materials... 
<br />GUI scripters (esp. arcade stuff)...
<br />realistic sound effects (the sounds in test-build 3 are placeholders)

<br /><br />This is a really, really bad idea since the player.def and a few vanilla sound shaders and materials will get overwritten if you do this.
<br /><br />Set up the files as a mod.  If you don't want to create a shortcut with +fs_game eurowhatever in it, you can just unpack all of the files except for the vehcile gamex86.pk4... that way, it will show up in the Load Mod menu.

And no, we don't need to see work/a resume or any of that.  This is a community project and people contribute whatever they can, whenever they can.  
<br /><br />While there might be some overall "quality" goals that we strive to meet for the project, we have folks that are veteran mappers and folks that are just starting out.  Personally, I've noticed that anyone who is uncertain about their modding skills will quickly find that just by taking part in the community here, their work will improve in quality.  
<br /><br />That said, as soon as we hear back from Dante_uk regarding Block 10a (he wanted to work on it and one point, so I want to check with him first), we'll know if we have an opening.  Also, there may be some folks who haven't replied to me yet whose real lives are a bit too busy and they need a break from the project.  If that's the case, I'll post here or edit the first post with any openings.  
<br /><br />And, of course, mapping is only a fraction of what goes into the project.  If you'd like to help in any other way, just post about it and go for it.  Some of the things I know we're short of off the top of my head are:
<br /><br />static models... 
<br />animated models/characters...
<br />textures/materials... 
<br />GUI scripters (esp. arcade stuff)...
<br />realistic sound effects (the sounds in test-build 3 are placeholders)

<br /><br />This is a really, really bad idea since the player.def and a few vanilla sound shaders and materials will get overwritten if you do this.
<br /><br />Set up the files as a mod.  If you don't want to create a shortcut with +fs_game eurowhatever in it, you can just unpack all of the files except for the vehcile gamex86.pk4... that way, it will show up in the Load Mod menu.

<br /><br />Do you have a reference picture for that build?
<br /><br />I ask because there is a interesting build to the left of the museum ( block1 ) but I'm not sure which it is on the map, either 7 or 4 I suppose.

<br /><br />That's somewhere between 4 and 7, however, since the city map is not adhering exactly to Trafalgar sq. it ended being off.

<br /><br />You can also type map&lt;space&gt;&lt;somePartialFilename&gt;&lt;TAB&gt; and the resulting list will be narrowed down to the files that might still match.

<br />I'd like to make my block slightly bigger too. Just to add a small wall with railling and gateway to go across infront of my main building. ( I can proberly get a away with just moving the whole building further back, I'll try that first.
<br /><br />I mentioned a while back that the roads were too narrow in places for the buggy to drive down. This means the overall scale is slightly off for the spacing of the builds etc. Someone said they were going to re-work the base map to correct this but leave all the blocks the same(just more spaced).  I can't remember who's doing that or if they are still doing it.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p67008" date="Posted: Thu Dec 09, 2004 1:55 pm "><author>goliathvt</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I mentioned doing that, but that was before I saw the latest re-work by idiom, which did widen the roads and fix some scaling issues.  
<br /><br />To fix what is being discussed now, I think we have two options... share other ideas if you have them:
<br /><br />1) Map the roads and other environments last, as was suggested above, once we have all of the blocks completely done or nearly complete.  That way, we can designate one person to put all of the blocks and buildings together and adjust the road sizes appropriately.
<br /><br />2) Rework the "template map" now and have everyone copy over their work into the new one and make adjustments now.  
<br /><br />I see some problems or difficulties with both options:
<br /><br />With Opt. 1, it means that, beyond textures, it's probably not a good idea to work on the roads very much, because any work will likely be changed while we wait to get the final block versions mapped.
<br /><br />With Opt 2, there's always a chance that the "template map" will need more changing, which will mean people have to copy over their work all over again.
<br /><br />Personally, I'd vote for Option 1, since it seems logical to carve up the road (add hills, cracks, potholes, etc.) last anyway.  
<br /><br />In other words, I vote to let people enlarge their blocks <span style="font-style: italic">slightly</span>, as needed, but in a way that doesn't throw off the overall scale of the map.  Then, adjust the roads as a final step to account for the changes and perfect the map's scale.

<br /><br />Agreed.

I intentionally picked a small building, because I dont think I have time to work one of the really big ones. Probably same with everyone since most of the big ones are still open.
<br /><br />However, even though I picked a small one, I was thinking it would be nice if I could extend it vertically to like around 150% of the original size. Not a trivial amount. If this is a problem, could someone let me know before I really get started.
<br /><br />Also, I agree with option #1 above as well. Changing the roads around at the end of the whole thing has got to be the easiest way to do it. This way also, things like benches and street signs can be more integrated rather than slapped on an existing road and footpath that haven't been designed with them in mind.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p67106" date="Posted: Fri Dec 10, 2004 3:14 pm "><author>goliathvt</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Maybe the thing to do then, is to define a maximum value that people could extend their buildings.  One thing to remember is that on most city blocks, buildings aren't lined up perfectly anyway, so a little variation here and there won't really hurt much.  And, any large "gaps" that might arise from moving buildings around could be filled with appropriate things... like, say... putting a garden or row of bushes in front of the "shorter" buildlings.
<br /><br />GuyBrave:  I think people have agreed that it's fine to increase or decrease your building in the Z-direction any way you see fit, as that will not impact the placement of other neighboring buildings.

I'm at work now so these are, unfortunately, the most recent shots I have here:

<br /><br />They are just quick and dirty test textures...

<br /><br />You should see them better in these shots... Just some quick photoshop and nvidia plugin experimentation.

And no, we don't need to see work/a resume or any of that.  This is a community project and people contribute whatever they can, whenever they can.  
<br /><br />While there might be some overall "quality" goals that we strive to meet for the project, we have folks that are veteran mappers and folks that are just starting out.  Personally, I've noticed that anyone who is uncertain about their modding skills will quickly find that just by taking part in the community here, their work will improve in quality.  
<br /><br />That said, as soon as we hear back from Dante_uk regarding Block 10a (he wanted to work on it and one point, so I want to check with him first), we'll know if we have an opening.  Also, there may be some folks who haven't replied to me yet whose real lives are a bit too busy and they need a break from the project.  If that's the case, I'll post here or edit the first post with any openings.  
<br /><br />And, of course, mapping is only a fraction of what goes into the project.  If you'd like to help in any other way, just post about it and go for it.  Some of the things I know we're short of off the top of my head are:
<br /><br />static models... 
<br />animated models/characters...
<br />textures/materials... 
<br />GUI scripters (esp. arcade stuff)...
<br />realistic sound effects (the sounds in test-build 3 are placeholders)

<br /><br />This is a really, really bad idea since the player.def and a few vanilla sound shaders and materials will get overwritten if you do this.
<br /><br />Set up the files as a mod.  If you don't want to create a shortcut with +fs_game eurowhatever in it, you can just unpack all of the files except for the vehcile gamex86.pk4... that way, it will show up in the Load Mod menu.

<br /><br />First, there are some missing textures:
<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">WARNING: Couldn't load image: textures/euro/concrete001a<br />WARNING: Couldn't load image: textures/euro/brick01<br />WARNING: Couldn't load image: textures/euro/brick02<br />WARNING: Couldn't load image: textures/euro/brick02b</div>

<br /><br />That's somewhere between 4 and 7, however, since the city map is not adhering exactly to Trafalgar sq. it ended being off.

<br />I'd like to make my block slightly bigger too. Just to add a small wall with railling and gateway to go across infront of my main building. ( I can proberly get a away with just moving the whole building further back, I'll try that first.
<br /><br />I mentioned a while back that the roads were too narrow in places for the buggy to drive down. This means the overall scale is slightly off for the spacing of the builds etc. Someone said they were going to re-work the base map to correct this but leave all the blocks the same(just more spaced).  I can't remember who's doing that or if they are still doing it.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p67008" date="Posted: Thu Dec 09, 2004 1:55 pm "><author>goliathvt</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I mentioned doing that, but that was before I saw the latest re-work by idiom, which did widen the roads and fix some scaling issues.  
<br /><br />To fix what is being discussed now, I think we have two options... share other ideas if you have them:
<br /><br />1) Map the roads and other environments last, as was suggested above, once we have all of the blocks completely done or nearly complete.  That way, we can designate one person to put all of the blocks and buildings together and adjust the road sizes appropriately.
<br /><br />2) Rework the "template map" now and have everyone copy over their work into the new one and make adjustments now.  
<br /><br />I see some problems or difficulties with both options:
<br /><br />With Opt. 1, it means that, beyond textures, it's probably not a good idea to work on the roads very much, because any work will likely be changed while we wait to get the final block versions mapped.
<br /><br />With Opt 2, there's always a chance that the "template map" will need more changing, which will mean people have to copy over their work all over again.
<br /><br />Personally, I'd vote for Option 1, since it seems logical to carve up the road (add hills, cracks, potholes, etc.) last anyway.  
<br /><br />In other words, I vote to let people enlarge their blocks <span style="font-style: italic">slightly</span>, as needed, but in a way that doesn't throw off the overall scale of the map.  Then, adjust the roads as a final step to account for the changes and perfect the map's scale.

I intentionally picked a small building, because I dont think I have time to work one of the really big ones. Probably same with everyone since most of the big ones are still open.
<br /><br />However, even though I picked a small one, I was thinking it would be nice if I could extend it vertically to like around 150% of the original size. Not a trivial amount. If this is a problem, could someone let me know before I really get started.
<br /><br />Also, I agree with option #1 above as well. Changing the roads around at the end of the whole thing has got to be the easiest way to do it. This way also, things like benches and street signs can be more integrated rather than slapped on an existing road and footpath that haven't been designed with them in mind.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p67106" date="Posted: Fri Dec 10, 2004 3:14 pm "><author>goliathvt</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Maybe the thing to do then, is to define a maximum value that people could extend their buildings.  One thing to remember is that on most city blocks, buildings aren't lined up perfectly anyway, so a little variation here and there won't really hurt much.  And, any large "gaps" that might arise from moving buildings around could be filled with appropriate things... like, say... putting a garden or row of bushes in front of the "shorter" buildlings.
<br /><br />GuyBrave:  I think people have agreed that it's fine to increase or decrease your building in the Z-direction any way you see fit, as that will not impact the placement of other neighboring buildings.

Don't feel guilty for using your talents and creativity... the job on your first block is outstanding (as is everyone else's for that matter).  It's cool that you are offering it to someone else if they want it, though, so I'll leave it up to you and whoever that may be to sort out what you want to do if that case comes up.  
<br /><br />Also, I'm fairly certain we can iron out any performance issues if they arise.  I'm going to spend some free time over the next few days to see if I can fix the spots where there are less-than ideal FPS scores.

If that's fine, I'll be more than happy to join in.
<br /><br />Little side note for anyone interested: Here are some (rather old) shots of my testbed/outdoor/half-life 2 inspired map which kind of fits in with the whole D3CDIT theme. I know most of it is untextured and rather simple, but it runs fine on my old Ti4200 and XP2000+, even with most of the world textured, several monsters and no optimisation... It's an idustrial type area with a train loading station with silos, a canal, train bridge, a little junk yard, garage, gas station... I'm at work now so these are, unfortunately, the most recent shots I have here:

<br /><br />Basically it's a listing of theatres in London with a picture of each one. It's amazing many different styles of facades there are in just the one city.
<br />It also tells you things like:

And no, we don't need to see work/a resume or any of that.  This is a community project and people contribute whatever they can, whenever they can.  
<br /><br />While there might be some overall "quality" goals that we strive to meet for the project, we have folks that are veteran mappers and folks that are just starting out.  Personally, I've noticed that anyone who is uncertain about their modding skills will quickly find that just by taking part in the community here, their work will improve in quality.  
<br /><br />That said, as soon as we hear back from Dante_uk regarding Block 10a (he wanted to work on it and one point, so I want to check with him first), we'll know if we have an opening.  Also, there may be some folks who haven't replied to me yet whose real lives are a bit too busy and they need a break from the project.  If that's the case, I'll post here or edit the first post with any openings.  
<br /><br />And, of course, mapping is only a fraction of what goes into the project.  If you'd like to help in any other way, just post about it and go for it.  Some of the things I know we're short of off the top of my head are:
<br /><br />static models... 
<br />animated models/characters...
<br />textures/materials... 
<br />GUI scripters (esp. arcade stuff)...
<br />realistic sound effects (the sounds in test-build 3 are placeholders)

<br /><br />This is a really, really bad idea since the player.def and a few vanilla sound shaders and materials will get overwritten if you do this.
<br /><br />Set up the files as a mod.  If you don't want to create a shortcut with +fs_game eurowhatever in it, you can just unpack all of the files except for the vehcile gamex86.pk4... that way, it will show up in the Load Mod menu.
