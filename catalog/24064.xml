I've been reading just about every tutorial here in search of the answer to this - no luck (but I might easily have missed it).<br /><br />I'm sure you can recall the numerous cables and wires in Doom3 and RoE; they often adorn walls and floors, sometimes connecting up lighting systems, sometimes running from generators into opened panels in the floor or wall.<br /><br />I wonder if anyone here can explain how this was done?

Does D3Edit allow something similar for the creating of very thin wiring and cables?<br /><br />I understand how to create curved pipes and hoses with patch meshes in D3Edit (thanks to the tutorials here), but surely those often very long and thin multicurved wires and cables in Doom3 must have been drawn differently..?<br /><br />Any help or advice gratefully received, as always.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p228536" date="Posted: Sat Nov 20, 2010 10:18 pm "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Many cables in D3 are just flat patches with a double sided texture on it.<br />Walk exactly beneath such a hanging wire micxture and look up - nothing.<br /><br />Of course designers have mixed them nicely up with very few cylindrical patches. <br />You can spot the flat cable textures by pointing the flashlight at them - alpha masks don't cast shadows accordingly to the non-transparent details.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p228545" date="Posted: Sun Nov 21, 2010 2:20 pm "><author>reko</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Yeah, <br />Do a simple patch mesh and then choose a texture from decals I believe.
