About the incendiary ammo, yes it uses standard MP40 ammo, as because I can't place new type of ammo on the maps, but only on the black market.<br />As for the upgrade you already have it is because I haven't added a new upgrade type, but replaced an existent one, so if you already have this upgrade on your save games, it will make automatically have icendiary ammo. You have to restart a new game to make the upgrade to be buyable after Castle.<br /><br />Hope the SDK come soon, as I can tweak those features better and quicker, the def files aren't enough. But I'll look into making the nazi females npcs killable, should be doable with only the defs.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p218306" date="Posted: Sat Sep 05, 2009 9:55 am "><author>Dafama2k7</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Please, i think that <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-style: italic">removing the directional indicator of grenade throw will be a very good feature</span></span>, this kind of things are too console childish, so removing anything like this will be fine i think.<br /><br />It's strange that it isn't any console command to do﻿ this with easy. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320002350im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Note !...: I am referring to the minute 1:36 on your second new 2k9 Wolfenstein mod video.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p218307" date="Posted: Sat Sep 05, 2009 9:59 am "><author>Dafama2k7</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Also, i have seen on many videos that when you are selecting weapons from the circle, the sounds and/or music stops, automatically killing the immersion feel, so, can fix this kind of things also ?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p218310" date="Posted: Sat Sep 05, 2009 10:47 am "><author>vertex007</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Dafama2k7 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Please, i think that <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-style: italic">removing the directional indicator of grenade throw will be a very good feature</span></span></div><br /><br />not necessarily, game becomes pretty busy later on, you really can´t take notice of every granade you are thrown at without the indicator,  I would make it optional at best.<br /><br />but the veil amulet thing could go away, you always know how much and which powers you use anyway, it just too intrusive and cheesy looking imo.<br /><br />some indicators do make sense, others don´t  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320002350im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p218314" date="Posted: Sat Sep 05, 2009 11:29 am "><author>Megazoid</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">vertex007 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">on my wishlist : - Remove the cheesy amulet !<br />                      - nazi females npc killable </div><br /><br />I was playing the other day, and one of the "general's mistresses" was killed by an enemy grenade which I thought was funny.

But I'll look into making the nazi females npcs killable, should be doable with only the defs.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p218306" date="Posted: Sat Sep 05, 2009 9:55 am "><author>Dafama2k7</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Please, i think that <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-style: italic">removing the directional indicator of grenade throw will be a very good feature</span></span>, this kind of things are too console childish, so removing anything like this will be fine i think.<br /><br />It's strange that it isn't any console command to do﻿ this with easy. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320002657im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Note !...: I am referring to the minute 1:36 on your second new 2k9 Wolfenstein mod video.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p218307" date="Posted: Sat Sep 05, 2009 9:59 am "><author>Dafama2k7</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Also, i have seen on many videos that when you are selecting weapons from the circle, the sounds and/or music stops, automatically killing the immersion feel, so, can fix this kind of things also ?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p218310" date="Posted: Sat Sep 05, 2009 10:47 am "><author>vertex007</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Dafama2k7 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Please, i think that <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-style: italic">removing the directional indicator of grenade throw will be a very good feature</span></span></div><br /><br />not necessarily, game becomes pretty busy later on, you really can´t take notice of every granade you are thrown at without the indicator,  I would make it optional at best.<br /><br />but the veil amulet thing could go away, you always know how much and which powers you use anyway, it just too intrusive and cheesy looking imo.<br /><br />some indicators do make sense, others don´t  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320002657im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p218314" date="Posted: Sat Sep 05, 2009 11:29 am "><author>Megazoid</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">vertex007 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">on my wishlist : - Remove the cheesy amulet !<br />                      - nazi females npc killable </div><br /><br />I was playing the other day, and one of the "general's mistresses" was killed by an enemy grenade which I thought was funny.

I tried to balance it a little, when you take the upgrade the carryable ammo drop from 200 to 80 and the precision is lowered, the price of the ammo is higher and weapons and ammo pickups give less ammo, plus the upgrade can be taken only after Castle. But yeah is overpowered still. <br /><br />I would like to tweak it more, any suggestion is appreciated.<br /><br />As for the postprocess thing, yeah it break the overall looks, but for now I think is better than nothing.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p218296" date="Posted: Fri Sep 04, 2009 7:59 pm "><author>Neurological</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Sorry for double post, but I've updated the first post with a new version of the mod.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p218303" date="Posted: Sat Sep 05, 2009 1:31 am "><author>goliathvt</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">No problem at all w/ extra posts.

About the incendiary ammo, yes it uses standard MP40 ammo, as because I can't place new type of ammo on the maps, but only on the black market.<br />As for the upgrade you already have it is because I haven't added a new upgrade type, but replaced an existent one, so if you already have this upgrade on your save games, it will make automatically have icendiary ammo. You have to restart a new game to make the upgrade to be buyable after Castle.<br /><br />Hope the SDK come soon, as I can tweak those features better and quicker, the def files aren't enough. But I'll look into making the nazi females npcs killable, should be doable with only the defs.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p218306" date="Posted: Sat Sep 05, 2009 9:55 am "><author>Dafama2k7</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Please, i think that <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-style: italic">removing the directional indicator of grenade throw will be a very good feature</span></span>, this kind of things are too console childish, so removing anything like this will be fine i think.<br /><br />It's strange that it isn't any console command to do﻿ this with easy. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225010131im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Note !...: I am referring to the minute 1:36 on your second new 2k9 Wolfenstein mod video.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p218307" date="Posted: Sat Sep 05, 2009 9:59 am "><author>Dafama2k7</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Also, i have seen on many videos that when you are selecting weapons from the circle, the sounds and/or music stops, automatically killing the immersion feel, so, can fix this kind of things also ?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p218310" date="Posted: Sat Sep 05, 2009 10:47 am "><author>vertex007</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Dafama2k7 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Please, i think that <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-style: italic">removing the directional indicator of grenade throw will be a very good feature</span></span></div><br /><br />not necessarily, game becomes pretty busy later on, you really can´t take notice of every granade you are thrown at without the indicator,  I would make it optional at best.<br /><br />but the veil amulet thing could go away, you always know how much and which powers you use anyway, it just too intrusive and cheesy looking imo.<br /><br />some indicators do make sense, others don´t  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225010131im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p218314" date="Posted: Sat Sep 05, 2009 11:29 am "><author>Megazoid</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">vertex007 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">on my wishlist : - Remove the cheesy amulet !<br />                      - nazi females npc killable </div><br /><br />I was playing the other day, and one of the "general's mistresses" was killed by an enemy grenade which I thought was funny.
