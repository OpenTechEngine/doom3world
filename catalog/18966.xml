<br />I'm trying to make a render of my normal map, but it wont load my model. I'm not sure of the reason as I havent done this before, but perhaps its because the model is not tripled. I'm using 3dsmax 6, how is tripling done in this? I searched for triple/tripling here and in the max help files but didnt find an answer.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p172910" date="Posted: Tue Mar 13, 2007 3:50 pm "><author>MuD</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Oops!

<br /><br />Its for a metal sign, the circle is an elevated piece, with 4 screws around the sign holding it on the wall. I know this texture could be made with renderbumpflat, but I want to learn how to generate one from a high and low poly model, this is just a test. I'm going to search around for solutions but if anyone knows what the problem may be, please post and tell me. Thanks!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p206370" date="Posted: Tue Oct 21, 2008 12:02 am "><author>LDAsh</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">(oops, accidental necro'd, this thread showed up in the "most active" list for some reason) <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203061521im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />Looks like you've got some "smoothing" on your low-poly model that's exaggerating the normalmap along what should be a flat surface, you can try just selecthing those faces and just giving them flat smoothing, should fix it.  You can weld and smooth again when you're done.  And it also looks incorrect around the elevated circular part, the rim shouldn't be 1 colour like that.  I don't know why that would be though, not without inspecting both models.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p172842" date="Posted: Mon Mar 12, 2007 7:22 pm "><author>MuD</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Hi
