By root bone do you mean the origin? If I assign each piece of the gun to a bone, do I still need an origin bone? If so, do I assign the whole thing to the origin bone? Also, can I apply the skin modifier to everything, and insert the bones where I need them, or do I have to skin each piece along with its respective bone? I know I'm asking a lot of questions, and I appreciate your help. Hopefully I'll have something to show for it soon.<br /><br />Edit: Ok, here's what I've been doing. I've been using the group button to fuse pieces of the gun into the groups that I want. One for the barrel of the gun, another for the receiver, and then a third for the pump (the animated part). Then, I have inserted bones. I have not touched the envelopes. After that, I have gone one group at a time, using the skin modifier, and then assigning each group its own bone. Then I run beserkers exporter, and I have to select each piece of the gun, despite the groups. And I always get error messages. I also have not inserted an origin bone. I tried putting one in, naming it origin, and then adding it to the list of bones for each group, but nothing happened. Please explain to me, like a four year old, what I am doing wrong in those steps? Without visual aids telling me exactly what to do, I'm a lost puppy.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p204965" date="Posted: Wed Sep 17, 2008 12:38 am "><author>thedarkwolf333</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I am attempting to create a new weapon for Doom 3, and I have my model pretty much in 3DS Max.
