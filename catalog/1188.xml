<br/><br/>
- The usual way is to export a model from gmax to one of the file formats that's included when you load up a <span style="font-weight: bold">gamepack</span>, MD3 that comes with the Quake3 <span style="font-weight: bold">Tempest</span> plugin for example.&#13;
<br/><br/>
- You then need to open that known format either directly by using an import plugin to MAX or <span style="font-weight: bold">convert</span> it using one of the file converters that are floating around the web.&#13;
<br/><br/>
- There are limitaions though and they have to do with the MD3 format itself.... models can't be bigger than 1024x1024 otherwise they bork up, and you can't animate an MD3.&#13;
<br/><br/>
The other way to export is to output your gmax file to the *.pls (plasma) file format from gmax and again import that into MAX.

To make a this you can use program called 3D Exploration: 1. Make a model in gmax and export it in .MD3-format (there are many export-plug-in available). 2. Open 3D Exploration and use open/MD3. Then export model in .3DS-format (or DXF). Now open studio max and use import/.3DS.&#13;
<br/><br/>
But you can use Studio Max MD3.import-plug-in too.&#13;
<br/><br/>
In Studio Max use export/3DS. Then you can import that in gmax.</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>
