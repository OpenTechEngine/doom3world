The only drawback = the game is old and looks pretty bad.
<br /><br />The gameplay for those who don't know of it:
<br />You can play as one of the 3 races brought together by a crossover by 20th Century Fox: Alien, Marine, or Predator.
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Marines</span> are standard FPS. They get some guns, and are set out to be killed.
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">The Predators</span> behave as their counterparts from the movies. They can jump high, fight with retractable claws, become invisible, pin people to walls.
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">The Aliens</span> can run on walls, jump high, and get hitpoints from eating corpses.
<br /><br />AvP mods get "foxed", that means Fox forbids them to use their intellectual property, and they get shut down. So one might muse the gameplay of the brilliant AvP2 to create something on Doom3?
<br /><br />Only 2 teams this time: Doom3 USMC Marines, against the demons of hell.
<br />All models, textures and sounds are taken from Doom3. 
<br /><br />Marines play as marines, get several "classes" or weapon loadouts, and act as cannonfodder  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil" /><br />Demons on the other hand can do the wall-crawl stuff (as Imps and those 2headed things do in Doom3) Throw fireballs, spawn AI Trites/Ticks/Lostsouls to attack the marines.
<br /><br />As for gameplay? Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Objective of some sort.
<br /><br />All this set in the dark and brooding athmosphere of Doom3. Even in "vanilla" Doom3, with max 4 players on a MP server this would work IMO.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p154006" date="Posted: Thu Aug 17, 2006 10:48 pm "><author>Bo$bevok</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">sounds interesting but have u got any screenshots or concept art?

<br />Like, lots of innocent people (Mars city -like levels) and you (imp/hellknight/lostsoul ?) messing around. Oh yeah, beware of marines, they shoot back sometimes <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p154118" date="Posted: Fri Aug 18, 2006 6:08 pm "><author>zenarion</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Bo$bevok wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">sounds interesting but have u got any screenshots or concept art?<br /><br />....or are u waiting for sum1 else to do it  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /></div>
<br /><br />I was just tossing ideas. Tied down with too much work as it is, learning about the D3 engine. Maybe when i can stand my ground i will make something of this.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p154156" date="Posted: Sat Aug 19, 2006 12:08 am "><author>Phobos</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">=NoMercy= wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I dont consider it dated either I consider it out-dated  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /></div>

<br /><br />Nah, outdated usually means that it is obselete, whereas something that is just dated is old but can still be good/useful.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p154233" date="Posted: Sat Aug 19, 2006 4:05 pm "><author>zenarion</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">It is still good and useful. AvP2 that is. But the awesome looking aliens, and the murderous predator deserve a revamp. Imagine them with normal+spec maps, better animations, and new sounds <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post></posts></thread></xml>
