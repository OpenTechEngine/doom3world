I've been working in a variety of game engines in the last couple of months, from CryEngine to UDK, to Torque. However, I still like the structure and feel of idTech engines. With the BFG release hopefully fixing the networking bugs I'd like to try to get a nice outdoor map going as a proof of concept for a later game.  My one problem with idTech games is they always seem to be rather drab and gloomy, so I'd like to try doing a map that looks exactly the opposite as kind of a study.  The question is, what do I need to do this, engine and mods wise?  When I've tried to fake outdoor lighting with ambient lights it seems to fail.  <br /><br />The goals for this map:<br /><br />Detailed outdoor terrain using Worldmachine and sculpting/mesh painting.  This will probably be on the order of 20k polys (At least) and with split large textures (4096 x 4 or something).<br />Grass and Trees.<br />Water.<br />Bright, cheery sunshine. The ability to fake ambient light. <br /><br />To make it more complicated, I'd rather not use radiant. Rather, I'd like to import everything using .ase as static models.  The question is, how should I construct things for efficiency? Do I use separate collision models?  Also, I think some of Sikkmod's shaders can make this map work, like the HDR shader.<br /><br />So, I'm throwing this to you, the Doom3 modding community, hopefully you can help.  If anyone's interested in collaborating that would be great too.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p243441" date="Posted: Fri Oct 26, 2012 4:17 am "><author>Tron</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">No time to look up the details right now but Sikkpin has come up with some better light shaders (which give you the ability to use a cubemap for ambient lighting)  and that combined with soft shadows and color grading would help.

I plan on knocking out the tutorial today and release tomarrow, that mixed with DXT compression, and the massive speed boosts I put in the megatexture code its pretty close to being practical for production use. <br /><br />I made some changes just now actually that might allow for a megatexture to have the same size normal map, I might try to get that in before release, but that double the space requirement.

This is more of a proof of concept with the current D3 code and any easily applicable mods. Same goes with megatexture, it's just too complicated for me to handle. <br /><br />What I'm more concerned about now is the lighting with the current D3 code, the ambient looks bad for outdoor stuff. <br /><br />But as far as your mod is concerned my workflow will probably be using World Machine or something like that to generate a 32k (or so) texture and using it as the terrain cover, then importing models and using the texture paint/VT tool to cover the gaps between the terrain and models.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p243701" date="Posted: Tue Oct 30, 2012 4:25 am "><author>Oneofthe8devilz</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">The following scenes below all include some form of outdoor scene integration, so if you like something, feel free to private message me and I can fill you into details of what was involved in getting those scenes built... <br /><br />...

I plan on knocking out the tutorial today and release tomarrow, that mixed with DXT compression, and the massive speed boosts I put in the megatexture code its pretty close to being practical for production use. <br /><br />I made some changes just now actually that might allow for a megatexture to have the same size normal map, I might try to get that in before release, but that double the space requirement. As it is each megatexture will only take up 682mb a piece.</div>]]></body></post></posts></thread></xml>
