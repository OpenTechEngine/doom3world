<br /><br />I can't remeber my exaxt details, but I've been as "audio" as you're visual.
<br /><br />I found it pretty surprising - I always thought I'm oh so visual, but now I start to understand why I dislike people who tend to choose wrong words while meaning the right thing.
<br /><br />I'll give it a try some time later in the future.
<br /><br />There are some interesting personality tests here as well:

<br /><br />I pretty much knew it would work out that way for me - fairly decent at art and design and good with sound, but only average at math.
<br /><br />Interesting side note - I went clay pigeon shooting the other day for the first time (never really shot a gun before) - there's a dominant eye in shooting and I wonder whether it relates to your left / right brain hemispheres ?
<br /><br />To test, point at a distant object - even across the room, as long as it's over 10 feet away (the further the better)
<br />Now, close your right eye -  does the object you are pointing at 'move' ?
<br />Close your right and open your left  -  does the object you are pointing at 'move' ?
<br /><br />Whichever eye that doesn't see the object move, if your dominant eye and one you should always use when aiming.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p152113" date="Posted: Thu Aug 03, 2006 1:16 pm "><author>makc</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I 've got something like

<br /><br />I pretty much knew it would work out that way for me - fairly decent at art and design and good with sound, but only average at math.
<br /><br />Interesting side note - I went clay pigeon shooting the other day for the first time (never really shot a gun before) - there's a dominant eye in shooting and I wonder whether it relates to your left / right brain hemispheres ?
<br /><br />To test, point at a distant object - even across the room, as long as it's over 10 feet away (the further the better)
<br />Now, close your right eye -  does the object you are pointing at 'move' ?
<br />Close your right and open your left  -  does the object you are pointing at 'move' ?

<br /><br />I admit that 2nd/3rd run was a bit quicker and perhaps more spontaneous, but I cannot say I answered "against my brain". 
<br />Now the funny thing is that the personal evaluations for ALL three results were quite appealing in the sense that I could indentify with many or most of the stuff.
<br /><br />So here's my question for the author of the test:

It just feels quite unnatural.
<br />Of course, my personality traits would say otherwise.

<br /><br />waccy-baccy - it's so widely used in this country, it's ridiculous. We still have some strict laws, but they are getting more liberal about it. You can now be caught smoking or in the possession of maybe 2 or 3 joints and you'll just get a warning - they won't even confiscate your stuff.

<br /><br />Yeah no kidding.  While I always vote, I can understand peoples' disenchantment with the supposed thing we US Americans call "democracy".  R's and D's are so alike in their desire to line their pockets and cow-tow to big businesses (where the real power lies in the US) that I can hardly stomach voting for a Dem just to get a certain "rich white boy who has failed at everything all his life but had a rich white daddy to bail him out at every turn" out of office.  And that as$hole is against affirmative action... rofl.  His whole life has been a case study in it!  Of course, we just don't call rich white boy privilege anything, because that might muck up the assumption that rich white brats are entitled to everything they didn't earn.  But I digress....
<br /><br />Of course, things are changing.  I give talks on US foreign policy in my spare time (yes, seriously... hey, someone's got to do it) and last year was the first time the NY Times was forced to say something like, "There may still be two superpowers on the planet: the United States and world public opinion" (2/17/03).  It's pretty much unprecedented for such a mainstream partyline-toting paper to have to acknowledge world public opinion so blatantly.  Usually it's marginalized to a much greater extent.  Similarly, while anti-war folks like myself were unable to prevent the Bush administration from carrying out their plans, it was amazing to have the overwhelming majority of the world, let alone hundreds of thousands in the US, protest a war before it even broke out.  Recall that it took several years and the deaths of thousands of US troops before people cared about or protested Viet Nam.  
<br /><br />But anyway...

<br />1.: 66% left, 66% auditory
<br />2.: 58% left, 75% visual
<br />3.: 77% right, 78% visual
<br /><br />I admit that 2nd/3rd run was a bit quicker and perhaps more spontaneous, but I cannot say I answered "against my brain". 
<br />Now the funny thing is that the personal evaluations for ALL three results were quite appealing in the sense that I could indentify with many or most of the stuff.
<br /><br />So here's my question for the author of the test:
<br />"Which of the following three words do you like most:"

<br />anyways, i always thought myself to be strongly left brained. mostly because I have olmost no usage of my left hand/arm and left leg. that is, its not like i'm paralyzed or anything actually physically. its things like kicking a ball with my left leg is near impossible to control. or if i were to throw a ball with my left arm. It just feels quite unnatural.
<br />Of course, my personality traits would say otherwise.
<br /><br />I might take it agian when i'm more tired and confused.

<br /><br />waccy-baccy - it's so widely used in this country, it's ridiculous. We still have some strict laws, but they are getting more liberal about it. You can now be caught smoking or in the possession of maybe 2 or 3 joints and you'll just get a warning - they won't even confiscate your stuff.
<br /><br />Dunno about Europe, but drinking where I live is a big passtime and a source of jokes of the variety of "I got so hammered last night I....." type thing.

<br /><br />"Why vote when electoral votes are all that count and you have to choose between puppet #1 and puppet #2?" said the informed few.
<br /><br />Anyway, someone take the silly brain test and post your results. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081113043658im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p18476" date="Posted: Wed Feb 11, 2004 9:37 pm "><author>goliathvt</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">To hijack this thread further...
<br /><br />Yeah no kidding.  While I always vote, I can understand peoples' disenchantment with the supposed thing we US Americans call "democracy".  R's and D's are so alike in their desire to line their pockets and cow-tow to big businesses (where the real power lies in the US) that I can hardly stomach voting for a Dem just to get a certain "rich white boy who has failed at everything all his life but had a rich white daddy to bail him out at every turn" out of office.  And that as$hole is against affirmative action... rofl.  His whole life has been a case study in it!  Of course, we just don't call rich white boy privilege anything, because that might muck up the assumption that rich white brats are entitled to everything they didn't earn.  But I digress....
<br /><br />Of course, things are changing.  I give talks on US foreign policy in my spare time (yes, seriously... hey, someone's got to do it) and last year was the first time the NY Times was forced to say something like, "There may still be two superpowers on the planet: the United States and world public opinion" (2/17/03).  It's pretty much unprecedented for such a mainstream partyline-toting paper to have to acknowledge world public opinion so blatantly.  Usually it's marginalized to a much greater extent.  Similarly, while anti-war folks like myself were unable to prevent the Bush administration from carrying out their plans, it was amazing to have the overwhelming majority of the world, let alone hundreds of thousands in the US, protest a war before it even broke out.  Recall that it took several years and the deaths of thousands of US troops before people cared about or protested Viet Nam.  
<br /><br />But anyway... 
<br /><br />*ahem*

<br /><br />I admit that 2nd/3rd run was a bit quicker and perhaps more spontaneous, but I cannot say I answered "against my brain". 
<br />Now the funny thing is that the personal evaluations for ALL three results were quite appealing in the sense that I could indentify with many or most of the stuff.
<br /><br />So here's my question for the author of the test:
<br />"Which of the following three words do you like most:"
<br /><span style="font-style: italic">(a) Horoscope<br />(b) Popularism<br />(c) Crap </span> <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081118040036im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p18206" date="Posted: Fri Feb 06, 2004 10:35 am "><author>Qwertys</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I'm too lazy to post my scores. that test hurt my brain. I was like "WTF?!^^"
<br />anyways, i always thought myself to be strongly left brained. mostly because I have olmost no usage of my left hand/arm and left leg. that is, its not like i'm paralyzed or anything actually physically. its things like kicking a ball with my left leg is near impossible to control. or if i were to throw a ball with my left arm. It just feels quite unnatural.
<br />Of course, my personality traits would say otherwise.
<br /><br />I might take it agian when i'm more tired and confused.
<br />Try the Emode tests though, they are quite good.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p18213" date="Posted: Sat Feb 07, 2004 1:05 am "><author>Renholder</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Is this test some kind of initiation ?

<br /><br />waccy-baccy - it's so widely used in this country, it's ridiculous. We still have some strict laws, but they are getting more liberal about it. You can now be caught smoking or in the possession of maybe 2 or 3 joints and you'll just get a warning - they won't even confiscate your stuff.
<br /><br />Dunno about Europe, but drinking where I live is a big passtime and a source of jokes of the variety of "I got so hammered last night I....." type thing.
<br /><br />I tried an IQ test whilst inebriated once and suffice to say, I went down from the 130's to the 90's

<br /><br />"Bush is the sheeit! You teach dem muslims what for! Yeehaw!" said the ignorant masses.
<br /><br />"Why vote when electoral votes are all that count and you have to choose between puppet #1 and puppet #2?" said the informed few.
<br /><br />Anyway, someone take the silly brain test and post your results. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081118040527im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p18476" date="Posted: Wed Feb 11, 2004 9:37 pm "><author>goliathvt</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">To hijack this thread further...
<br /><br />Yeah no kidding.  While I always vote, I can understand peoples' disenchantment with the supposed thing we US Americans call "democracy".  R's and D's are so alike in their desire to line their pockets and cow-tow to big businesses (where the real power lies in the US) that I can hardly stomach voting for a Dem just to get a certain "rich white boy who has failed at everything all his life but had a rich white daddy to bail him out at every turn" out of office.  And that as$hole is against affirmative action... rofl.  His whole life has been a case study in it!  Of course, we just don't call rich white boy privilege anything, because that might muck up the assumption that rich white brats are entitled to everything they didn't earn.  But I digress....
<br /><br />Of course, things are changing.  I give talks on US foreign policy in my spare time (yes, seriously... hey, someone's got to do it) and last year was the first time the NY Times was forced to say something like, "There may still be two superpowers on the planet: the United States and world public opinion" (2/17/03).  It's pretty much unprecedented for such a mainstream partyline-toting paper to have to acknowledge world public opinion so blatantly.  Usually it's marginalized to a much greater extent.  Similarly, while anti-war folks like myself were unable to prevent the Bush administration from carrying out their plans, it was amazing to have the overwhelming majority of the world, let alone hundreds of thousands in the US, protest a war before it even broke out.  Recall that it took several years and the deaths of thousands of US troops before people cared about or protested Viet Nam.  
<br /><br />But anyway... 
<br /><br />*ahem*
<br /><br />So... that brain test thingy.... <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081118040527im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />Goliath</div>]]></body></post><post id="p19814" date="Posted: Thu Mar 04, 2004 7:36 am "><author>Antony_Ace</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">The most surprising brain/char test was the one posted afterwards.

<br /><br />waccy-baccy - it's so widely used in this country, it's ridiculous. We still have some strict laws, but they are getting more liberal about it.

<br />1.: 66% left, 66% auditory

<br />3.: 77% right, 78% visual
<br /><br />I admit that 2nd/3rd run was a bit quicker and perhaps more spontaneous, but I cannot say I answered "against my brain". 
<br />Now the funny thing is that the personal evaluations for ALL three results were quite appealing in the sense that I could indentify with many or most of the stuff.
<br /><br />So here's my question for the author of the test:
<br />"Which of the following three words do you like most:"

<br />anyways, i always thought myself to be strongly left brained. mostly because I have olmost no usage of my left hand/arm and left leg. that is, its not like i'm paralyzed or anything actually physically. its things like kicking a ball with my left leg is near impossible to control. or if i were to throw a ball with my left arm. It just feels quite unnatural.
<br />Of course, my personality traits would say otherwise.

<br /><br />waccy-baccy - it's so widely used in this country, it's ridiculous. We still have some strict laws, but they are getting more liberal about it. You can now be caught smoking or in the possession of maybe 2 or 3 joints and you'll just get a warning - they won't even confiscate your stuff.
<br /><br />Dunno about Europe, but drinking where I live is a big passtime and a source of jokes of the variety of "I got so hammered last night I....." type thing.

<br /><br />I pretty much knew it would work out that way for me - fairly decent at art and design and good with sound, but only average at math.
<br /><br />Interesting side note - I went clay pigeon shooting the other day for the first time (never really shot a gun before) - there's a dominant eye in shooting and I wonder whether it relates to your left / right brain hemispheres ?
<br /><br />To test, point at a distant object - even across the room, as long as it's over 10 feet away (the further the better)
<br />Now, close your right eye -  does the object you are pointing at 'move' ?
<br />Close your right and open your left  -  does the object you are pointing at 'move' ?
<br /><br />Whichever eye that doesn't see the object move, if your dominant eye and one you should always use when aiming.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p96" date="Posted: Mon Jul 29, 2002 12:10 pm "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">

<br /><br />I found it pretty surprising - I always thought I'm oh so visual, but now I start to understand why I dislike people who tend to choose wrong words while meaning the right thing.
<br /><br />I'll give it a try some time later in the future.

<br /><br />I pretty much knew it would work out that way for me - fairly decent at art and design and good with sound, but only average at math.
<br /><br />Interesting side note - I went clay pigeon shooting the other day for the first time (never really shot a gun before) - there's a dominant eye in shooting and I wonder whether it relates to your left / right brain hemispheres ?
<br /><br />To test, point at a distant object - even across the room, as long as it's over 10 feet away (the further the better)
<br />Now, close your right eye -  does the object you are pointing at 'move' ?

<br /><br />Yeah no kidding.  While I always vote, I can understand peoples' disenchantment with the supposed thing we US Americans call "democracy".  R's and D's are so alike in their desire to line their pockets and cow-tow to big businesses (where the real power lies in the US) that I can hardly stomach voting for a Dem just to get a certain "rich white boy who has failed at everything all his life but had a rich white daddy to bail him out at every turn" out of office.  And that as$hole is against affirmative action... rofl.  His whole life has been a case study in it!  Of course, we just don't call rich white boy privilege anything, because that might muck up the assumption that rich white brats are entitled to everything they didn't earn.  But I digress....
<br /><br />Of course, things are changing.  I give talks on US foreign policy in my spare time (yes, seriously... hey, someone's got to do it) and last year was the first time the NY Times was forced to say something like, "There may still be two superpowers on the planet: the United States and world public opinion" (2/17/03).

<br /><br />Yeah no kidding.  While I always vote, I can understand peoples' disenchantment with the supposed thing we US Americans call "democracy".  R's and D's are so alike in their desire to line their pockets and cow-tow to big businesses (where the real power lies in the US) that I can hardly stomach voting for a Dem just to get a certain "rich white boy who has failed at everything all his life but had a rich white daddy to bail him out at every turn" out of office.  And that as$hole is against affirmative action... rofl.  His whole life has been a case study in it!  Of course, we just don't call rich white boy privilege anything, because that might muck up the assumption that rich white brats are entitled to everything they didn't earn.  But I digress....
<br /><br />Of course, things are changing.  I give talks on US foreign policy in my spare time (yes, seriously... hey, someone's got to do it) and last year was the first time the NY Times was forced to say something like, "There may still be two superpowers on the planet: the United States and world public opinion" (2/17/03).  It's pretty much unprecedented for such a mainstream partyline-toting paper to have to acknowledge world public opinion so blatantly.  Usually it's marginalized to a much greater extent.  Similarly, while anti-war folks like myself were unable to prevent the Bush administration from carrying out their plans, it was amazing to have the overwhelming majority of the world, let alone hundreds of thousands in the US, protest a war before it even broke out.  Recall that it took several years and the deaths of thousands of US troops before people cared about or protested Viet Nam.

<br /><br />Yeah no kidding.  While I always vote, I can understand peoples' disenchantment with the supposed thing we US Americans call "democracy".  R's and D's are so alike in their desire to line their pockets and cow-tow to big businesses (where the real power lies in the US) that I can hardly stomach voting for a Dem just to get a certain "rich white boy who has failed at everything all his life but had a rich white daddy to bail him out at every turn" out of office.  And that as$hole is against affirmative action... rofl.  His whole life has been a case study in it!  Of course, we just don't call rich white boy privilege anything, because that might muck up the assumption that rich white brats are entitled to everything they didn't earn.  But I digress....
<br /><br />Of course, things are changing.  I give talks on US foreign policy in my spare time (yes, seriously... hey, someone's got to do it) and last year was the first time the NY Times was forced to say something like, "There may still be two superpowers on the planet: the United States and world public opinion" (2/17/03).  It's pretty much unprecedented for such a mainstream partyline-toting paper to have to acknowledge world public opinion so blatantly.  Usually it's marginalized to a much greater extent.  Similarly, while anti-war folks like myself were unable to prevent the Bush administration from carrying out their plans, it was amazing to have the overwhelming majority of the world, let alone hundreds of thousands in the US, protest a war before it even broke out.  Recall that it took several years and the deaths of thousands of US troops before people cared about or protested Viet Nam.

<br /><br />I pretty much knew it would work out that way for me - fairly decent at art and design and good with sound, but only average at math.
<br /><br />Interesting side note - I went clay pigeon shooting the other day for the first time (never really shot a gun before) - there's a dominant eye in shooting and I wonder whether it relates to your left / right brain hemispheres ?
<br /><br />To test, point at a distant object - even across the room, as long as it's over 10 feet away (the further the better)
<br />Now, close your right eye -  does the object you are pointing at 'move' ?
<br />Close your right and open your left  -  does the object you are pointing at 'move' ?
<br /><br />Whichever eye that doesn't see the object move, if your dominant eye and one you should always use when aiming.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p18246" date="Posted: Sun Feb 08, 2004 9:37 pm "><author>Qwertys</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">its because we wonder what it feels like to be part of the general american populus.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p18256" date="Posted: Mon Feb 09, 2004 1:31 am "><author>rich_is_bored</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">HI! <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081118035735im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />* Waves *

<br /><br />"Bush is the sheeit! You teach dem muslims what for! Yeehaw!" said the ignorant masses.
<br /><br />"Why vote when electoral votes are all that count and you have to choose between puppet #1 and puppet #2?" said the informed few.
<br /><br />Anyway, someone take the silly brain test and post your results. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081118035735im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p18476" date="Posted: Wed Feb 11, 2004 9:37 pm "><author>goliathvt</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">To hijack this thread further...
<br /><br />Yeah no kidding.  While I always vote, I can understand peoples' disenchantment with the supposed thing we US Americans call "democracy".  R's and D's are so alike in their desire to line their pockets and cow-tow to big businesses (where the real power lies in the US) that I can hardly stomach voting for a Dem just to get a certain "rich white boy who has failed at everything all his life but had a rich white daddy to bail him out at every turn" out of office.  And that as$hole is against affirmative action... rofl.  His whole life has been a case study in it!  Of course, we just don't call rich white boy privilege anything, because that might muck up the assumption that rich white brats are entitled to everything they didn't earn.  But I digress....
<br /><br />Of course, things are changing.  I give talks on US foreign policy in my spare time (yes, seriously... hey, someone's got to do it) and last year was the first time the NY Times was forced to say something like, "There may still be two superpowers on the planet: the United States and world public opinion" (2/17/03).  It's pretty much unprecedented for such a mainstream partyline-toting paper to have to acknowledge world public opinion so blatantly.  Usually it's marginalized to a much greater extent.  Similarly, while anti-war folks like myself were unable to prevent the Bush administration from carrying out their plans, it was amazing to have the overwhelming majority of the world, let alone hundreds of thousands in the US, protest a war before it even broke out.  Recall that it took several years and the deaths of thousands of US troops before people cared about or protested Viet Nam.  
<br /><br />But anyway... 
<br /><br />*ahem*
<br /><br />So... that brain test thingy.... <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081118035735im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />Goliath</div>]]></body></post><post id="p19814" date="Posted: Thu Mar 04, 2004 7:36 am "><author>Antony_Ace</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">The most surprising brain/char test was the one posted afterwards.

<br /><br />"Why vote when electoral votes are all that count and you have to choose between puppet #1 and puppet #2?" said the informed few.
<br /><br />Anyway, someone take the silly brain test and post your results. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081118040851im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p18476" date="Posted: Wed Feb 11, 2004 9:37 pm "><author>goliathvt</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">To hijack this thread further...
<br /><br />Yeah no kidding.  While I always vote, I can understand peoples' disenchantment with the supposed thing we US Americans call "democracy".  R's and D's are so alike in their desire to line their pockets and cow-tow to big businesses (where the real power lies in the US) that I can hardly stomach voting for a Dem just to get a certain "rich white boy who has failed at everything all his life but had a rich white daddy to bail him out at every turn" out of office.  And that as$hole is against affirmative action... rofl.  His whole life has been a case study in it!  Of course, we just don't call rich white boy privilege anything, because that might muck up the assumption that rich white brats are entitled to everything they didn't earn.  But I digress....
<br /><br />Of course, things are changing.  I give talks on US foreign policy in my spare time (yes, seriously... hey, someone's got to do it) and last year was the first time the NY Times was forced to say something like, "There may still be two superpowers on the planet: the United States and world public opinion" (2/17/03).  It's pretty much unprecedented for such a mainstream partyline-toting paper to have to acknowledge world public opinion so blatantly.  Usually it's marginalized to a much greater extent.  Similarly, while anti-war folks like myself were unable to prevent the Bush administration from carrying out their plans, it was amazing to have the overwhelming majority of the world, let alone hundreds of thousands in the US, protest a war before it even broke out.  Recall that it took several years and the deaths of thousands of US troops before people cared about or protested Viet Nam.  
<br /><br />But anyway... 
<br /><br />*ahem*
<br /><br />So... that brain test thingy.... <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081118040851im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />Goliath</div>]]></body></post><post id="p19814" date="Posted: Thu Mar 04, 2004 7:36 am "><author>Antony_Ace</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">The most surprising brain/char test was the one posted afterwards.

<br /><br />I pretty much knew it would work out that way for me - fairly decent at art and design and good with sound, but only average at math.
<br /><br />Interesting side note - I went clay pigeon shooting the other day for the first time (never really shot a gun before) - there's a dominant eye in shooting and I wonder whether it relates to your left / right brain hemispheres ?
<br /><br />To test, point at a distant object - even across the room, as long as it's over 10 feet away (the further the better)
<br />Now, close your right eye -  does the object you are pointing at 'move' ?
<br />Close your right and open your left  -  does the object you are pointing at 'move' ?
<br /><br />Whichever eye that doesn't see the object move, if your dominant eye and one you should always use when aiming.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p152113" date="Posted: Thu Aug 03, 2006 1:16 pm "><author>makc</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I 've got something like

<br />3.: 77% right, 78% visual
<br /><br />I admit that 2nd/3rd run was a bit quicker and perhaps more spontaneous, but I cannot say I answered "against my brain". 
<br />Now the funny thing is that the personal evaluations for ALL three results were quite appealing in the sense that I could indentify with many or most of the stuff.
<br /><br />So here's my question for the author of the test:
<br />"Which of the following three words do you like most:"

<br />anyways, i always thought myself to be strongly left brained. mostly because I have olmost no usage of my left hand/arm and left leg. that is, its not like i'm paralyzed or anything actually physically. its things like kicking a ball with my left leg is near impossible to control. or if i were to throw a ball with my left arm. It just feels quite unnatural.
<br />Of course, my personality traits would say otherwise.

<br /><br />waccy-baccy - it's so widely used in this country, it's ridiculous. We still have some strict laws, but they are getting more liberal about it. You can now be caught smoking or in the possession of maybe 2 or 3 joints and you'll just get a warning - they won't even confiscate your stuff.
<br /><br />Dunno about Europe, but drinking where I live is a big passtime and a source of jokes of the variety of "I got so hammered last night I....." type thing.
<br /><br />I tried an IQ test whilst inebriated once and suffice to say, I went down from the 130's to the 90's

<br />1.: 66% left, 66% auditory
<br />2.: 58% left, 75% visual
<br />3.: 77% right, 78% visual
<br /><br />I admit that 2nd/3rd run was a bit quicker and perhaps more spontaneous, but I cannot say I answered "against my brain". 
<br />Now the funny thing is that the personal evaluations for ALL three results were quite appealing in the sense that I could indentify with many or most of the stuff.
<br /><br />So here's my question for the author of the test:
<br />"Which of the following three words do you like most:"
<br /><span style="font-style: italic">(a) Horoscope<br />(b) Popularism<br />(c) Crap </span> <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081119110524im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p18206" date="Posted: Fri Feb 06, 2004 10:35 am "><author>Qwertys</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I'm too lazy to post my scores. that test hurt my brain. I was like "WTF?!^^"
<br />anyways, i always thought myself to be strongly left brained. mostly because I have olmost no usage of my left hand/arm and left leg. that is, its not like i'm paralyzed or anything actually physically. its things like kicking a ball with my left leg is near impossible to control. or if i were to throw a ball with my left arm. It just feels quite unnatural.
<br />Of course, my personality traits would say otherwise.
<br /><br />I might take it agian when i'm more tired and confused.

<br /><br />waccy-baccy - it's so widely used in this country, it's ridiculous. We still have some strict laws, but they are getting more liberal about it. You can now be caught smoking or in the possession of maybe 2 or 3 joints and you'll just get a warning - they won't even confiscate your stuff.
<br /><br />Dunno about Europe, but drinking where I live is a big passtime and a source of jokes of the variety of "I got so hammered last night I....." type thing.
<br /><br />I tried an IQ test whilst inebriated once and suffice to say, I went down from the 130's to the 90's 
<br /><br />Perhaps that's why I like getting drunk <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081119110524im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />"So you ride yourselves over the fields and

<br /><br />I pretty much knew it would work out that way for me - fairly decent at art and design and good with sound, but only average at math.
<br /><br />Interesting side note - I went clay pigeon shooting the other day for the first time (never really shot a gun before) - there's a dominant eye in shooting and I wonder whether it relates to your left / right brain hemispheres ?
<br /><br />To test, point at a distant object - even across the room, as long as it's over 10 feet away (the further the better)
<br />Now, close your right eye -  does the object you are pointing at 'move' ?
<br />Close your right and open your left  -  does the object you are pointing at 'move' ?
<br /><br />Whichever eye that doesn't see the object move, if your dominant eye and one you should always use when aiming.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p96" date="Posted: Mon Jul 29, 2002 12:10 pm "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">

<br /><br />I pretty much knew it would work out that way for me - fairly decent at art and design and good with sound, but only average at math.
<br /><br />Interesting side note - I went clay pigeon shooting the other day for the first time (never really shot a gun before) - there's a dominant eye in shooting and I wonder whether it relates to your left / right brain hemispheres ?
<br /><br />To test, point at a distant object - even across the room, as long as it's over 10 feet away (the further the better)
<br />Now, close your right eye -  does the object you are pointing at 'move' ?
<br />Close your right and open your left  -  does the object you are pointing at 'move' ?

<br /><br />I admit that 2nd/3rd run was a bit quicker and perhaps more spontaneous, but I cannot say I answered "against my brain". 
<br />Now the funny thing is that the personal evaluations for ALL three results were quite appealing in the sense that I could indentify with many or most of the stuff.
<br /><br />So here's my question for the author of the test:
<br />"Which of the following three words do you like most:"

<br />anyways, i always thought myself to be strongly left brained. mostly because I have olmost no usage of my left hand/arm and left leg. that is, its not like i'm paralyzed or anything actually physically. its things like kicking a ball with my left leg is near impossible to control. or if i were to throw a ball with my left arm. It just feels quite unnatural.
<br />Of course, my personality traits would say otherwise.

<br /><br />waccy-baccy - it's so widely used in this country, it's ridiculous. We still have some strict laws, but they are getting more liberal about it. You can now be caught smoking or in the possession of maybe 2 or 3 joints and you'll just get a warning - they won't even confiscate your stuff.

<br />anyways, i always thought myself to be strongly left brained. mostly because I have olmost no usage of my left hand/arm and left leg. that is, its not like i'm paralyzed or anything actually physically. its things like kicking a ball with my left leg is near impossible to control. or if i were to throw a ball with my left arm. It just feels quite unnatural.
<br />Of course, my personality traits would say otherwise.

It just feels quite unnatural.
<br />Of course, my personality traits would say otherwise.

It just feels quite unnatural.
<br />Of course, my personality traits would say otherwise.

<br /><br />"Bush is the sheeit! You teach dem muslims what for! Yeehaw!" said the ignorant masses.
<br /><br />"Why vote when electoral votes are all that count and you have to choose between puppet #1 and puppet #2?" said the informed few.
<br /><br />Anyway, someone take the silly brain test and post your results. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081118035910im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p18476" date="Posted: Wed Feb 11, 2004 9:37 pm "><author>goliathvt</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">To hijack this thread further...
<br /><br />Yeah no kidding.  While I always vote, I can understand peoples' disenchantment with the supposed thing we US Americans call "democracy".  R's and D's are so alike in their desire to line their pockets and cow-tow to big businesses (where the real power lies in the US) that I can hardly stomach voting for a Dem just to get a certain "rich white boy who has failed at everything all his life but had a rich white daddy to bail him out at every turn" out of office.  And that as$hole is against affirmative action... rofl.  His whole life has been a case study in it!  Of course, we just don't call rich white boy privilege anything, because that might muck up the assumption that rich white brats are entitled to everything they didn't earn.  But I digress....
<br /><br />Of course, things are changing.  I give talks on US foreign policy in my spare time (yes, seriously... hey, someone's got to do it) and last year was the first time the NY Times was forced to say something like, "There may still be two superpowers on the planet: the United States and world public opinion" (2/17/03).  It's pretty much unprecedented for such a mainstream partyline-toting paper to have to acknowledge world public opinion so blatantly.  Usually it's marginalized to a much greater extent.  Similarly, while anti-war folks like myself were unable to prevent the Bush administration from carrying out their plans, it was amazing to have the overwhelming majority of the world, let alone hundreds of thousands in the US, protest a war before it even broke out.  Recall that it took several years and the deaths of thousands of US troops before people cared about or protested Viet Nam.  
<br /><br />But anyway... 
<br /><br />*ahem*
<br /><br />So... that brain test thingy.... <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081118035910im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />Goliath</div>]]></body></post><post id="p19814" date="Posted: Thu Mar 04, 2004 7:36 am "><author>Antony_Ace</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">The most surprising brain/char test was the one posted afterwards.

<br /><br />Yeah no kidding.  While I always vote, I can understand peoples' disenchantment with the supposed thing we US Americans call "democracy".  R's and D's are so alike in their desire to line their pockets and cow-tow to big businesses (where the real power lies in the US) that I can hardly stomach voting for a Dem just to get a certain "rich white boy who has failed at everything all his life but had a rich white daddy to bail him out at every turn" out of office.  And that as$hole is against affirmative action... rofl.  His whole life has been a case study in it!  Of course, we just don't call rich white boy privilege anything, because that might muck up the assumption that rich white brats are entitled to everything they didn't earn.  But I digress....
<br /><br />Of course, things are changing.  I give talks on US foreign policy in my spare time (yes, seriously... hey, someone's got to do it) and last year was the first time the NY Times was forced to say something like, "There may still be two superpowers on the planet: the United States and world public opinion" (2/17/03).  It's pretty much unprecedented for such a mainstream partyline-toting paper to have to acknowledge world public opinion so blatantly.  Usually it's marginalized to a much greater extent.  Similarly, while anti-war folks like myself were unable to prevent the Bush administration from carrying out their plans, it was amazing to have the overwhelming majority of the world, let alone hundreds of thousands in the US, protest a war before it even broke out.  Recall that it took several years and the deaths of thousands of US troops before people cared about or protested Viet Nam.

Similarly, while anti-war folks like myself were unable to prevent the Bush administration from carrying out their plans, it was amazing to have the overwhelming majority of the world, let alone hundreds of thousands in the US, protest a war before it even broke out.  Recall that it took several years and the deaths of thousands of US troops before people cared about or protested Viet Nam.  
<br /><br />But anyway...

<br /><br />I pretty much knew it would work out that way for me - fairly decent at art and design and good with sound, but only average at math.
<br /><br />Interesting side note - I went clay pigeon shooting the other day for the first time (never really shot a gun before) - there's a dominant eye in shooting and I wonder whether it relates to your left / right brain hemispheres ?
<br /><br />To test, point at a distant object - even across the room, as long as it's over 10 feet away (the further the better)
<br />Now, close your right eye -  does the object you are pointing at 'move' ?
<br />Close your right and open your left  -  does the object you are pointing at 'move' ?
<br /><br />Whichever eye that doesn't see the object move, if your dominant eye and one you should always use when aiming.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p152113" date="Posted: Thu Aug 03, 2006 1:16 pm "><author>makc</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I 've got something like

<br /><br />I pretty much knew it would work out that way for me - fairly decent at art and design and good with sound, but only average at math.
<br /><br />Interesting side note - I went clay pigeon shooting the other day for the first time (never really shot a gun before) - there's a dominant eye in shooting and I wonder whether it relates to your left / right brain hemispheres ?
<br /><br />To test, point at a distant object - even across the room, as long as it's over 10 feet away (the further the better)
<br />Now, close your right eye -  does the object you are pointing at 'move' ?
<br />Close your right and open your left  -  does the object you are pointing at 'move' ?
<br /><br />Whichever eye that doesn't see the object move, if your dominant eye and one you should always use when aiming.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p18246" date="Posted: Sun Feb 08, 2004 9:37 pm "><author>Qwertys</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">its because we wonder what it feels like to be part of the general american populus.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p18256" date="Posted: Mon Feb 09, 2004 1:31 am "><author>rich_is_bored</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">HI! <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081118041219im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />* Waves *

<br /><br />"Why vote when electoral votes are all that count and you have to choose between puppet #1 and puppet #2?" said the informed few.
<br /><br />Anyway, someone take the silly brain test and post your results. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081118041219im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p18476" date="Posted: Wed Feb 11, 2004 9:37 pm "><author>goliathvt</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">To hijack this thread further...
<br /><br />Yeah no kidding.  While I always vote, I can understand peoples' disenchantment with the supposed thing we US Americans call "democracy".  R's and D's are so alike in their desire to line their pockets and cow-tow to big businesses (where the real power lies in the US) that I can hardly stomach voting for a Dem just to get a certain "rich white boy who has failed at everything all his life but had a rich white daddy to bail him out at every turn" out of office.  And that as$hole is against affirmative action... rofl.  His whole life has been a case study in it!  Of course, we just don't call rich white boy privilege anything, because that might muck up the assumption that rich white brats are entitled to everything they didn't earn.  But I digress....
<br /><br />Of course, things are changing.  I give talks on US foreign policy in my spare time (yes, seriously... hey, someone's got to do it) and last year was the first time the NY Times was forced to say something like, "There may still be two superpowers on the planet: the United States and world public opinion" (2/17/03).  It's pretty much unprecedented for such a mainstream partyline-toting paper to have to acknowledge world public opinion so blatantly.  Usually it's marginalized to a much greater extent.  Similarly, while anti-war folks like myself were unable to prevent the Bush administration from carrying out their plans, it was amazing to have the overwhelming majority of the world, let alone hundreds of thousands in the US, protest a war before it even broke out.  Recall that it took several years and the deaths of thousands of US troops before people cared about or protested Viet Nam.  
<br /><br />But anyway... 
<br /><br />*ahem*
<br /><br />So... that brain test thingy.... <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081118041219im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />Goliath</div>]]></body></post><post id="p19814" date="Posted: Thu Mar 04, 2004 7:36 am "><author>Antony_Ace</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">The most surprising brain/char test was the one posted afterwards.

<br /><br />Interesting side note - I went clay pigeon shooting the other day for the first time (never really shot a gun before) - there's a dominant eye in shooting and I wonder whether it relates to your left / right brain hemispheres ?
<br /><br />To test, point at a distant object - even across the room, as long as it's over 10 feet away (the further the better)
<br />Now, close your right eye -  does the object you are pointing at 'move' ?
<br />Close your right and open your left  -  does the object you are pointing at 'move' ?
<br /><br />Whichever eye that doesn't see the object move, if your dominant eye and one you should always use when aiming.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p96" date="Posted: Mon Jul 29, 2002 12:10 pm "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">

<br /><br />I can't remeber my exaxt details, but I've been as "audio" as you're visual.
<br /><br />I found it pretty surprising - I always thought I'm oh so visual, but now I start to understand why I dislike people who tend to choose wrong words while meaning the right thing.
<br /><br />I'll give it a try some time later in the future.
<br /><br />There are some interesting personality tests here as well:

<br /><br />Yeah no kidding.  While I always vote, I can understand peoples' disenchantment with the supposed thing we US Americans call "democracy".  R's and D's are so alike in their desire to line their pockets and cow-tow to big businesses (where the real power lies in the US) that I can hardly stomach voting for a Dem just to get a certain "rich white boy who has failed at everything all his life but had a rich white daddy to bail him out at every turn" out of office.  And that as$hole is against affirmative action... rofl.  His whole life has been a case study in it!  Of course, we just don't call rich white boy privilege anything, because that might muck up the assumption that rich white brats are entitled to everything they didn't earn.  But I digress....
<br /><br />Of course, things are changing.  I give talks on US foreign policy in my spare time (yes, seriously... hey, someone's got to do it) and last year was the first time the NY Times was forced to say something like, "There may still be two superpowers on the planet: the United States and world public opinion" (2/17/03).  It's pretty much unprecedented for such a mainstream partyline-toting paper to have to acknowledge world public opinion so blatantly.  Usually it's marginalized to a much greater extent.  Similarly, while anti-war folks like myself were unable to prevent the Bush administration from carrying out their plans, it was amazing to have the overwhelming majority of the world, let alone hundreds of thousands in the US, protest a war before it even broke out.

<br /><br />"Bush is the sheeit! You teach dem muslims what for! Yeehaw!" said the ignorant masses.
<br /><br />"Why vote when electoral votes are all that count and you have to choose between puppet #1 and puppet #2?" said the informed few.
<br /><br />Anyway, someone take the silly brain test and post your results. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081118040444im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p18476" date="Posted: Wed Feb 11, 2004 9:37 pm "><author>goliathvt</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">To hijack this thread further...
<br /><br />Yeah no kidding.  While I always vote, I can understand peoples' disenchantment with the supposed thing we US Americans call "democracy".  R's and D's are so alike in their desire to line their pockets and cow-tow to big businesses (where the real power lies in the US) that I can hardly stomach voting for a Dem just to get a certain "rich white boy who has failed at everything all his life but had a rich white daddy to bail him out at every turn" out of office.  And that as$hole is against affirmative action... rofl.  His whole life has been a case study in it!  Of course, we just don't call rich white boy privilege anything, because that might muck up the assumption that rich white brats are entitled to everything they didn't earn.  But I digress....
<br /><br />Of course, things are changing.  I give talks on US foreign policy in my spare time (yes, seriously... hey, someone's got to do it) and last year was the first time the NY Times was forced to say something like, "There may still be two superpowers on the planet: the United States and world public opinion" (2/17/03).  It's pretty much unprecedented for such a mainstream partyline-toting paper to have to acknowledge world public opinion so blatantly.  Usually it's marginalized to a much greater extent.  Similarly, while anti-war folks like myself were unable to prevent the Bush administration from carrying out their plans, it was amazing to have the overwhelming majority of the world, let alone hundreds of thousands in the US, protest a war before it even broke out.  Recall that it took several years and the deaths of thousands of US troops before people cared about or protested Viet Nam.  
<br /><br />But anyway... 
<br /><br />*ahem*
<br /><br />So... that brain test thingy.... <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081118040444im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />Goliath</div>]]></body></post><post id="p19814" date="Posted: Thu Mar 04, 2004 7:36 am "><author>Antony_Ace</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">The most surprising brain/char test was the one posted afterwards.

<br /><br />I admit that 2nd/3rd run was a bit quicker and perhaps more spontaneous, but I cannot say I answered "against my brain". 
<br />Now the funny thing is that the personal evaluations for ALL three results were quite appealing in the sense that I could indentify with many or most of the stuff.
<br /><br />So here's my question for the author of the test:
<br />"Which of the following three words do you like most:"

<br /><br />waccy-baccy - it's so widely used in this country, it's ridiculous. We still have some strict laws, but they are getting more liberal about it.

<br /><br />"Bush is the sheeit! You teach dem muslims what for! Yeehaw!" said the ignorant masses.
<br /><br />"Why vote when electoral votes are all that count and you have to choose between puppet #1 and puppet #2?" said the informed few.
<br /><br />Anyway, someone take the silly brain test and post your results. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081118040106im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p18476" date="Posted: Wed Feb 11, 2004 9:37 pm "><author>goliathvt</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">To hijack this thread further...
<br /><br />Yeah no kidding.  While I always vote, I can understand peoples' disenchantment with the supposed thing we US Americans call "democracy".  R's and D's are so alike in their desire to line their pockets and cow-tow to big businesses (where the real power lies in the US) that I can hardly stomach voting for a Dem just to get a certain "rich white boy who has failed at everything all his life but had a rich white daddy to bail him out at every turn" out of office.  And that as$hole is against affirmative action... rofl.  His whole life has been a case study in it!  Of course, we just don't call rich white boy privilege anything, because that might muck up the assumption that rich white brats are entitled to everything they didn't earn.  But I digress....
<br /><br />Of course, things are changing.  I give talks on US foreign policy in my spare time (yes, seriously... hey, someone's got to do it) and last year was the first time the NY Times was forced to say something like, "There may still be two superpowers on the planet: the United States and world public opinion" (2/17/03).  It's pretty much unprecedented for such a mainstream partyline-toting paper to have to acknowledge world public opinion so blatantly.  Usually it's marginalized to a much greater extent.  Similarly, while anti-war folks like myself were unable to prevent the Bush administration from carrying out their plans, it was amazing to have the overwhelming majority of the world, let alone hundreds of thousands in the US, protest a war before it even broke out.  Recall that it took several years and the deaths of thousands of US troops before people cared about or protested Viet Nam.  
<br /><br />But anyway... 
<br /><br />*ahem*
<br /><br />So... that brain test thingy.... <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081118040106im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />Goliath</div>]]></body></post><post id="p19814" date="Posted: Thu Mar 04, 2004 7:36 am "><author>Antony_Ace</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">The most surprising brain/char test was the one posted afterwards.

<br /><br />Perhaps that's why I like getting drunk <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081119110206im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />"So you ride yourselves over the fields and

<br /><br />Yeah no kidding.  While I always vote, I can understand peoples' disenchantment with the supposed thing we US Americans call "democracy".  R's and D's are so alike in their desire to line their pockets and cow-tow to big businesses (where the real power lies in the US) that I can hardly stomach voting for a Dem just to get a certain "rich white boy who has failed at everything all his life but had a rich white daddy to bail him out at every turn" out of office.  And that as$hole is against affirmative action... rofl.  His whole life has been a case study in it!  Of course, we just don't call rich white boy privilege anything, because that might muck up the assumption that rich white brats are entitled to everything they didn't earn.  But I digress....
<br /><br />Of course, things are changing.  I give talks on US foreign policy in my spare time (yes, seriously... hey, someone's got to do it) and last year was the first time the NY Times was forced to say something like, "There may still be two superpowers on the planet: the United States and world public opinion" (2/17/03).  It's pretty much unprecedented for such a mainstream partyline-toting paper to have to acknowledge world public opinion so blatantly.  Usually it's marginalized to a much greater extent.  Similarly, while anti-war folks like myself were unable to prevent the Bush administration from carrying out their plans, it was amazing to have the overwhelming majority of the world, let alone hundreds of thousands in the US, protest a war before it even broke out.  Recall that it took several years and the deaths of thousands of US troops before people cared about or protested Viet Nam.

<br /><br />I pretty much knew it would work out that way for me - fairly decent at art and design and good with sound, but only average at math.
<br /><br />Interesting side note - I went clay pigeon shooting the other day for the first time (never really shot a gun before) - there's a dominant eye in shooting and I wonder whether it relates to your left / right brain hemispheres ?
<br /><br />To test, point at a distant object - even across the room, as long as it's over 10 feet away (the further the better)
<br />Now, close your right eye -  does the object you are pointing at 'move' ?
<br />Close your right and open your left  -  does the object you are pointing at 'move' ?
<br /><br />Whichever eye that doesn't see the object move, if your dominant eye and one you should always use when aiming.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p96" date="Posted: Mon Jul 29, 2002 12:10 pm "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">

<br /><br />I can't remeber my exaxt details, but I've been as "audio" as you're visual.
<br /><br />I found it pretty surprising - I always thought I'm oh so visual, but now I start to understand why I dislike people who tend to choose wrong words while meaning the right thing.
<br /><br />I'll give it a try some time later in the future.
<br /><br />There are some interesting personality tests here as well:

All this stuff reminds me of a 'compatability test' I did when at school as it was used to guide you in the direction of a possible career, at the time I could have been a park ranger (which I quite liked the idea of being..!)
<br /><br />I often think it's funny that although these things are devised as 'general guide' to personality it amazing how we all seem to fit into one or more catagories/pigeon holes when we tend to think we so individual, very interesting stuff imho.. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081118134419im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_idea.gif" alt=":idea:" title="Idea" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p117" date="Posted: Tue Aug 06, 2002 4:55 pm "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Yes dammit!
