<br/><br/>
I'm attempting to modle some objects in lightwave then place them in doom, pretty straight forward you'd think. However, I'm doing my modelling on a seperate machine (in this case a Mac) and trying to bring the objects across. My problem is that no matter what I try I can't seem to get the objects to use their UV maps, which leaves me with light absorbing black shapes, which isn'tt really the look I'm going for&#13;
<br/><br/>
Anybody able to shed some light on this for me?&#13;

A black object suggests a problem with your material shader or the reference to the material shader.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Just for shits and giggles make sure you name your surfaces to match the corrisponding material shader.&#13;
<br/><br/>
For instance, if I want to apply the material "textures\custom\foo" to my model, the surface name in Lightwave should read "textures\custom\foo".<br/>_________________<br/><a href="/web/20061012184010/http://www.doom3world.org/" target="_blank" class="postlink"><img src="/web/20061012184010im_/http://www.doom3world.org/site/img/d3w.gif" border="0"/>  Staff</a>&#13;

<br/>
 Do you mean you have a copy of lightwave on the PC as well, or are you just using the lwo you saved out from the mac and putting it in Doom?&#13;
<br/>
 What I do to sort out glitches in UV maps, since sometimes doom will show errors that don't show up in lightwave, is I open them with Deep Exploration, save them out as a .mb file, open the .mb file and export it to lwo again. This always solves any UV map problems in doom.&#13;

I'm just saving the object files out of the Mac and dropping them into doom on a Windows box.&#13;
<br/>
I'll try rich's suggestion, if that fails I'll give deep exploration a go, thank you.&#13;

If there are compatibility issues between Mac and PC lightwave I'm unaware of them too.  When I said "bringing them across" I didn't mean from lightwave to lightwave, just from lightwave (Mac) to Doom (PC).&#13;
<br/>
The only reason I'm doing it this way is because I know how to model in lightwave and the only version I have access to is on a Mac.&#13;
<br/><br/>
I wouldn't be at all surprised if it's naming issue (this is my first attempt at this), I'll try renaming the surfaces and see what I get.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Thanks, both of you.&#13;
