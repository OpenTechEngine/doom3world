<br /><br />I started by baking diffuse, specular, normal and ambient occlusion maps from high poly geometry to get the first layer; the underlying earth and leaves.
<br />The earth is a flat plane with _d, _s and a bump map and the leaves are highpoly models also with the 3 maps applied.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img204.imageshack.us/my.php?image=veiwport03cs5.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img204.imageshack.us/img204/3046/veiwport03cs5.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />After its been baked I use the earth and leaves texture for the base of the next layer where I placed models of grass, twigs, small weeds, and some less dead looking leaves to create a realistic looking ground texture, all these models have the 3 maps also.
<br /><br />I bake it for a second time. All the diffuse, specular and normal maps are combined and the ambient occlusion map is then multiplied onto the diffuse.

<br /><br />One reason I baked it twice is because; If I dont divide up the work like this my pc will simply run out of virtual memory and grind to a halt, im sure alot of you have more up to date computers than I do so it may not be a problem.
<br />Another reason is that I can build upon the leaves base texture multiple times to create many variants of ground textures to be used for vertex blended terrain and ultimatly megatexture.
<br /><br /><br />Heres the final result in quake4, the textures are 1024, and Ive put a single light above where the player is standing in these pics, theres a few specular highlights which were put in unintentually but Ive grown to like them, it makes the grass look wet like a morning dew in low light conditions and they disapear when the lights are brighter.

<br /><br />There is an over-reliance on photo-wrapping everything these days, in my opinion. It can look great, but there's something to be said for how building assets up like this helps everything appear as if it is made from the same "stuff."</div>]]></body></post><post id="p175263" date="Posted: Thu Apr 05, 2007 3:37 pm "><author>Dinky</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">What's everyone talking about? Everyone's heard of this.... From what I'm seeing this just looks like information being baked onto a single polygon from a higher resolution model... Doom 3 can do this with Renderbump...
<br /><br />And I don't know about 3dsmax, but in Maya the grass and stuff can all be created very easily using Maya's Paint tools which allow you to paint a curve and apply objects to them, and later you can turn them into geometry if you like (which you would have to if you wanted to bake them into a material like this). What's really cool about this tool is that you could model your own 3d objects (more than one normally to create variation) then tell Maya you want your objects to be placed in Maya's Paint Tool Library, and you can paint your own objects instead of painting Maya's default load out (which are awesome without any custom addition anyway).
<br /><br />I'm not saying Mikebart did a bad job or anything, I think it was awesome he took the time to get this down but it's not THAT hard because I'm sure he didn't have to model every individual grass thingy. I just want to be clear I'm not trying to put someone's work down, but infact I think it looks really great and the result is better than I would've imagined, but it's not as hard as some people are making it out to be here.

To my knowledge, Doom3 Renderbump is only useful for rendering normal maps but in saying that I really havent spent much time using it, so it may have other uses im unaware of.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">And I don't know about 3dsmax, but in Maya the grass and stuff can all be created very easily using Maya's Paint tools which allow you to paint a curve and apply objects to them, and later you can turn them into geometry if you like (which you would have to if you wanted to bake them into a material like this).

<br /><br />Well, im glad you found that amusing, lets just try and be real about this, 
<br />I've just read through the whole thread again and im looking hard to find any posts indicating that somebody thought I modeled each blade of grass individualy, thats just ridiculous Dinky <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /><br />Think before you post man.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p175435" date="Posted: Sat Apr 07, 2007 8:18 pm "><author>parsonsbear</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">While renderbumpflat isn't anything new, the devil's in the details with this stuff. When you actually sit down and attempt to make one of these things- especially something unusual, you have to make a ton of little choices that make or break the final result. I think the big news here is using traditional photoshop/texture techniques like mirroring borders in a 3d modeling package. Also, using normal mapped geometry in your highpoly model adds another level of complexity that you haven't seen in quake4 or d3. I think the only packages that do this are maya and 3dsmax? I've never used lightwave's solution, but i know renderbump and modo don't. 
<br /><br />Leads me to another question- your 3ds max normalmaps look great- i haven't had so much success in modo or maya generated maps, so i've been sticking to renderbump/flat, which means a lot of material writing while i'm working. Any idea why tangentspace maps vary so much?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p175075" date="Posted: Wed Apr 04, 2007 5:12 am "><author>mikebart</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Ive been doing a few expirements with grass in 3dsmax8 and getting some pretty convincing results.

<br /><br />I started by baking diffuse, specular, normal and ambient occlusion maps from high poly geometry to get the first layer; the underlying earth and leaves.
<br />The earth is a flat plane with _d, _s and a bump map and the leaves are highpoly models also with the 3 maps applied.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205110556/http://img204.imageshack.us/my.php?image=veiwport03cs5.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205110556im_/http://img204.imageshack.us/img204/3046/veiwport03cs5.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />After its been baked I use the earth and leaves texture for the base of the next layer where I placed models of grass, twigs, small weeds, and some less dead looking leaves to create a realistic looking ground texture, all these models have the 3 maps also.
<br /><br />I bake it for a second time. All the diffuse, specular and normal maps are combined and the ambient occlusion map is then multiplied onto the diffuse.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205110556/http://img204.imageshack.us/my.php?image=veiwport01ew9.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205110556im_/http://img204.imageshack.us/img204/2315/veiwport01ew9.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />Wireframe.

<br /><br />One reason I baked it twice is because; If I dont divide up the work like this my pc will simply run out of virtual memory and grind to a halt, im sure alot of you have more up to date computers than I do so it may not be a problem.
<br />Another reason is that I can build upon the leaves base texture multiple times to create many variants of ground textures to be used for vertex blended terrain and ultimatly megatexture.
<br /><br /><br />Heres the final result in quake4, the textures are 1024, and Ive put a single light above where the player is standing in these pics, theres a few specular highlights which were put in unintentually but Ive grown to like them, it makes the grass look wet like a morning dew in low light conditions and they disapear when the lights are brighter.

<br /><br /><br />Im not sure whether normalmaps were baked twice in doom3/quake4 like with the grass, but im pretty certain they were baking diffusemaps or atleast masks for some of the textures which is a pretty common thing, particularly some of the materials used in hell with the skulls and bones, bricks sticking out of the ground, that sort of thing, but this is really just speculation I find it pretty hard to tell how a texture's been made without seeing the workflow.
<br /><br />You're probably asking the wrong guy about why tangent space maps vary so much in different apps.
<br />I never really got into using renderbumpflat and I haven't explored many other apps in terms of normalmapping. 3dsmax is all pretty automated as far as baking multiple bumpmaps and normalmaps go, I just drop textures into the map slots and they get rendered out, bumpmaps can be combined with RGBmultiply and some other procedural effects can be applied too, but I havent gotten much more advanced than that, its just something I haven't fully explored yet.
<br />Render to texture in max is really quite simplified compared to some other apps, its not nearly as complicated as Zbrushes Zmapper which opens up a whole new level of complexity for normalmaps.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p175592" date="Posted: Mon Apr 09, 2007 10:52 am "><author>Tron</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Dinky wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">Tron wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Those shots look nice, going to <span style="font-weight: bold">all the effort of modelling all the blades of grass</span> definitely seems to have paid off in terms of the final normalmap.</div><br /><br />I thought before I posted.

<br /><br />I'd suggest adding in some grass that actually stands up(on some planes). Not lots and lots just a few dotted around so it enhances the feeling. And stops the viewer from thinking theres something not quite right.

<br /><br />@Happy friar; Theres a good chance im going to be selling the grass/terrain assets so I cant really hand out the maps, ill try and post some vids of it in action, but what you see in the screens and the descriptions that go with them is pretty much it, with the exception that you'd probably want to drop the resolution to atleast half for todays games.
<br /><br />@kit89; The grass will appear a bit flat when a light is shining directly onto it because its normal mapped, the ambient occlusion layer does help to give it some depth in those situations, without the ao it definitely would appear much flatter.
<br />You're right about the standing up grass, I still need to create some alphaplaned grass from the highpoly models, having them baked from the same models as the flat texture should really help to blend everything together.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p176197" date="Posted: Thu Apr 19, 2007 12:05 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">mikebart, cool and good luck with earning some money from your work, you deserve it imo.

<br /><br />I started by baking diffuse, specular, normal and ambient occlusion maps from high poly geometry to get the first layer; the underlying earth and leaves.
<br />The earth is a flat plane with _d, _s and a bump map and the leaves are highpoly models also with the 3 maps applied.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205143613/http://img204.imageshack.us/my.php?image=veiwport03cs5.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205143613im_/http://img204.imageshack.us/img204/3046/veiwport03cs5.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />After its been baked I use the earth and leaves texture for the base of the next layer where I placed models of grass, twigs, small weeds, and some less dead looking leaves to create a realistic looking ground texture, all these models have the 3 maps also.
<br /><br />I bake it for a second time. All the diffuse, specular and normal maps are combined and the ambient occlusion map is then multiplied onto the diffuse.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205143613/http://img204.imageshack.us/my.php?image=veiwport01ew9.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205143613im_/http://img204.imageshack.us/img204/2315/veiwport01ew9.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>

<br /><br />One reason I baked it twice is because; If I dont divide up the work like this my pc will simply run out of virtual memory and grind to a halt, im sure alot of you have more up to date computers than I do so it may not be a problem.
<br />Another reason is that I can build upon the leaves base texture multiple times to create many variants of ground textures to be used for vertex blended terrain and ultimatly megatexture.
<br /><br /><br />Heres the final result in quake4, the textures are 1024, and Ive put a single light above where the player is standing in these pics, theres a few specular highlights which were put in unintentually but Ive grown to like them, it makes the grass look wet like a morning dew in low light conditions and they disapear when the lights are brighter.

<br />I just got asked a few questions about making the grass and I thought that they might be useful here.
<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"> <br />I was wondering if you are having to use photoshop to get your texture to tile, or if there's something you are doing before baking. <br /></div><br /><br />I found getting this texture to tile nicely quite tricky, If I had a more powerful machine I could have used 9 instances set up on a grid (3 by 3) and projected the centre one, if anyone has any ideas regarding that id love to hear them but heres how I did it;<br /><br /> Once I was happy with the grass I made a copy, (the grass is made up of lots of clumps of various shapes and sizes, and the other weeds are individual models aswell.)<br /><br /> I then selected all the models around the edges of the copy (all the ones that over lapped the edge of the projection plane) keeping locked to the grid, I then copied the models to their opposite sides. <br /><br /> if you check out step 4.4 of <a href="viewtopic.php?t=17688" class="postlink">this tutoria</a>you should see what I mean, except in the case of the grass it must tile on both axis and it was a bit more fiddly because the models are more complex and there are more of them too.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I'd also like to know what kind of lighting setup you are using for baking. <br /></div>

<br /><br />And I don't know about 3dsmax, but in Maya the grass and stuff can all be created very easily using Maya's Paint tools which allow you to paint a curve and apply objects to them, and later you can turn them into geometry if you like (which you would have to if you wanted to bake them into a material like this). What's really cool about this tool is that you could model your own 3d objects (more than one normally to create variation) then tell Maya you want your objects to be placed in Maya's Paint Tool Library, and you can paint your own objects instead of painting Maya's default load out (which are awesome without any custom addition anyway).

When you actually sit down and attempt to make one of these things- especially something unusual, you have to make a ton of little choices that make or break the final result. I think the big news here is using traditional photoshop/texture techniques like mirroring borders in a 3d modeling package. Also, using normal mapped geometry in your highpoly model adds another level of complexity that you haven't seen in quake4 or d3. I think the only packages that do this are maya and 3dsmax?

<br /><br /><br />Im not sure whether normalmaps were baked twice in doom3/quake4 like with the grass, but im pretty certain they were baking diffusemaps or atleast masks for some of the textures which is a pretty common thing, particularly some of the materials used in hell with the skulls and bones, bricks sticking out of the ground, that sort of thing, but this is really just speculation I find it pretty hard to tell how a texture's been made without seeing the workflow.
<br /><br />You're probably asking the wrong guy about why tangent space maps vary so much in different apps.
<br />I never really got into using renderbumpflat and I haven't explored many other apps in terms of normalmapping. 3dsmax is all pretty automated as far as baking multiple bumpmaps and normalmaps go, I just drop textures into the map slots and they get rendered out, bumpmaps can be combined with RGBmultiply and some other procedural effects can be applied too, but I havent gotten much more advanced than that, its just something I haven't fully explored yet.
<br />Render to texture in max is really quite simplified compared to some other apps, its not nearly as complicated as Zbrushes Zmapper which opens up a whole new level of complexity for normalmaps.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p175592" date="Posted: Mon Apr 09, 2007 10:52 am "><author>Tron</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Dinky wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">Tron wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Those shots look nice, going to <span style="font-weight: bold">all the effort of modelling all the blades of grass</span> definitely seems to have paid off in terms of the final normalmap.</div><br /><br />I thought before I posted.

<br /><br />I started by baking diffuse, specular, normal and ambient occlusion maps from high poly geometry to get the first layer; the underlying earth and leaves.
<br />The earth is a flat plane with _d, _s and a bump map and the leaves are highpoly models also with the 3 maps applied.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205143613/http://img204.imageshack.us/my.php?image=veiwport03cs5.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205143613im_/http://img204.imageshack.us/img204/3046/veiwport03cs5.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />After its been baked I use the earth and leaves texture for the base of the next layer where I placed models of grass, twigs, small weeds, and some less dead looking leaves to create a realistic looking ground texture, all these models have the 3 maps also.
<br /><br />I bake it for a second time. All the diffuse, specular and normal maps are combined and the ambient occlusion map is then multiplied onto the diffuse.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205143613/http://img204.imageshack.us/my.php?image=veiwport01ew9.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205143613im_/http://img204.imageshack.us/img204/2315/veiwport01ew9.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />Wireframe.

<br /><br />One reason I baked it twice is because; If I dont divide up the work like this my pc will simply run out of virtual memory and grind to a halt, im sure alot of you have more up to date computers than I do so it may not be a problem.
<br />Another reason is that I can build upon the leaves base texture multiple times to create many variants of ground textures to be used for vertex blended terrain and ultimatly megatexture.
<br /><br /><br />Heres the final result in quake4, the textures are 1024, and Ive put a single light above where the player is standing in these pics, theres a few specular highlights which were put in unintentually but Ive grown to like them, it makes the grass look wet like a morning dew in low light conditions and they disapear when the lights are brighter.

<br />I just got asked a few questions about making the grass and I thought that they might be useful here.
<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"> <br />I was wondering if you are having to use photoshop to get your texture to tile, or if there's something you are doing before baking. <br /></div><br /><br />I found getting this texture to tile nicely quite tricky, If I had a more powerful machine I could have used 9 instances set up on a grid (3 by 3) and projected the centre one, if anyone has any ideas regarding that id love to hear them but heres how I did it;<br /><br /> Once I was happy with the grass I made a copy, (the grass is made up of lots of clumps of various shapes and sizes, and the other weeds are individual models aswell.)<br /><br /> I then selected all the models around the edges of the copy (all the ones that over lapped the edge of the projection plane) keeping locked to the grid, I then copied the models to their opposite sides. <br /><br /> if you check out step 4.4 of <a href="viewtopic.php?t=17688" class="postlink">this tutoria</a>you should see what I mean, except in the case of the grass it must tile on both axis and it was a bit more fiddly because the models are more complex and there are more of them too.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I'd also like to know what kind of lighting setup you are using for baking. <br /></div>
<br /><br />theres no lighting setup at all, I rendered 2 ambient occlusion maps, one for each layer</div>]]></body></post><post id="p175256" date="Posted: Thu Apr 05, 2007 3:23 pm "><author>BJA</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Seems that it was quite a lot of work but I think it was worth it.

<br /><br />There is an over-reliance on photo-wrapping everything these days, in my opinion.

Everyone's heard of this.... From what I'm seeing this just looks like information being baked onto a single polygon from a higher resolution model... Doom 3 can do this with Renderbump...
<br /><br />And I don't know about 3dsmax, but in Maya the grass and stuff can all be created very easily using Maya's Paint tools which allow you to paint a curve and apply objects to them, and later you can turn them into geometry if you like (which you would have to if you wanted to bake them into a material like this). What's really cool about this tool is that you could model your own 3d objects (more than one normally to create variation) then tell Maya you want your objects to be placed in Maya's Paint Tool Library, and you can paint your own objects instead of painting Maya's default load out (which are awesome without any custom addition anyway).
<br /><br />I'm not saying Mikebart did a bad job or anything, I think it was awesome he took the time to get this down but it's not THAT hard because I'm sure he didn't have to model every individual grass thingy. I just want to be clear I'm not trying to put someone's work down, but infact I think it looks really great and the result is better than I would've imagined, but it's not as hard as some people are making it out to be here.

<br /><br /><br />Im not sure whether normalmaps were baked twice in doom3/quake4 like with the grass, but im pretty certain they were baking diffusemaps or atleast masks for some of the textures which is a pretty common thing, particularly some of the materials used in hell with the skulls and bones, bricks sticking out of the ground, that sort of thing, but this is really just speculation I find it pretty hard to tell how a texture's been made without seeing the workflow.
<br /><br />You're probably asking the wrong guy about why tangent space maps vary so much in different apps.
<br />I never really got into using renderbumpflat and I haven't explored many other apps in terms of normalmapping. 3dsmax is all pretty automated as far as baking multiple bumpmaps and normalmaps go, I just drop textures into the map slots and they get rendered out, bumpmaps can be combined with RGBmultiply and some other procedural effects can be applied too, but I havent gotten much more advanced than that, its just something I haven't fully explored yet.
<br />Render to texture in max is really quite simplified compared to some other apps, its not nearly as complicated as Zbrushes Zmapper which opens up a whole new level of complexity for normalmaps.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p175592" date="Posted: Mon Apr 09, 2007 10:52 am "><author>Tron</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Dinky wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">Tron wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Those shots look nice, going to <span style="font-weight: bold">all the effort of modelling all the blades of grass</span> definitely seems to have paid off in terms of the final normalmap.</div><br /><br />I thought before I posted.

<br /><br />I'd suggest adding in some grass that actually stands up(on some planes). Not lots and lots just a few dotted around so it enhances the feeling. And stops the viewer from thinking theres something not quite right.

<br /><br />@Happy friar; Theres a good chance im going to be selling the grass/terrain assets so I cant really hand out the maps, ill try and post some vids of it in action, but what you see in the screens and the descriptions that go with them is pretty much it, with the exception that you'd probably want to drop the resolution to atleast half for todays games.
<br /><br />@kit89; The grass will appear a bit flat when a light is shining directly onto it because its normal mapped, the ambient occlusion layer does help to give it some depth in those situations, without the ao it definitely would appear much flatter.
<br />You're right about the standing up grass, I still need to create some alphaplaned grass from the highpoly models, having them baked from the same models as the flat texture should really help to blend everything together.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p176197" date="Posted: Wed Apr 18, 2007 11:05 pm "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">mikebart, cool and good luck with earning some money from your work, you deserve it imo.

<br /><br />I started by baking diffuse, specular, normal and ambient occlusion maps from high poly geometry to get the first layer; the underlying earth and leaves.
<br />The earth is a flat plane with _d, _s and a bump map and the leaves are highpoly models also with the 3 maps applied.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205110618/http://img204.imageshack.us/my.php?image=veiwport03cs5.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205110618im_/http://img204.imageshack.us/img204/3046/veiwport03cs5.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />After its been baked I use the earth and leaves texture for the base of the next layer where I placed models of grass, twigs, small weeds, and some less dead looking leaves to create a realistic looking ground texture, all these models have the 3 maps also.
<br /><br />I bake it for a second time. All the diffuse, specular and normal maps are combined and the ambient occlusion map is then multiplied onto the diffuse.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205110618/http://img204.imageshack.us/my.php?image=veiwport01ew9.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205110618im_/http://img204.imageshack.us/img204/2315/veiwport01ew9.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>

<br /><br />One reason I baked it twice is because; If I dont divide up the work like this my pc will simply run out of virtual memory and grind to a halt, im sure alot of you have more up to date computers than I do so it may not be a problem.
<br />Another reason is that I can build upon the leaves base texture multiple times to create many variants of ground textures to be used for vertex blended terrain and ultimatly megatexture.
<br /><br /><br />Heres the final result in quake4, the textures are 1024, and Ive put a single light above where the player is standing in these pics, theres a few specular highlights which were put in unintentually but Ive grown to like them, it makes the grass look wet like a morning dew in low light conditions and they disapear when the lights are brighter.

<br />I just got asked a few questions about making the grass and I thought that they might be useful here.
<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"> <br />I was wondering if you are having to use photoshop to get your texture to tile, or if there's something you are doing before baking. <br /></div><br /><br />I found getting this texture to tile nicely quite tricky, If I had a more powerful machine I could have used 9 instances set up on a grid (3 by 3) and projected the centre one, if anyone has any ideas regarding that id love to hear them but heres how I did it;<br /><br /> Once I was happy with the grass I made a copy, (the grass is made up of lots of clumps of various shapes and sizes, and the other weeds are individual models aswell.)<br /><br /> I then selected all the models around the edges of the copy (all the ones that over lapped the edge of the projection plane) keeping locked to the grid, I then copied the models to their opposite sides. <br /><br /> if you check out step 4.4 of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205110618/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=17688" class="postlink">this tutoria</a>you should see what I mean, except in the case of the grass it must tile on both axis and it was a bit more fiddly because the models are more complex and there are more of them too.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I'd also like to know what kind of lighting setup you are using for baking. <br /></div>

<br /><br />And I don't know about 3dsmax, but in Maya the grass and stuff can all be created very easily using Maya's Paint tools which allow you to paint a curve and apply objects to them, and later you can turn them into geometry if you like (which you would have to if you wanted to bake them into a material like this). What's really cool about this tool is that you could model your own 3d objects (more than one normally to create variation) then tell Maya you want your objects to be placed in Maya's Paint Tool Library, and you can paint your own objects instead of painting Maya's default load out (which are awesome without any custom addition anyway).
<br /><br />I'm not saying Mikebart did a bad job or anything, I think it was awesome he took the time to get this down but it's not THAT hard because I'm sure he didn't have to model every individual grass thingy.

<br /><br /><br />Im not sure whether normalmaps were baked twice in doom3/quake4 like with the grass, but im pretty certain they were baking diffusemaps or atleast masks for some of the textures which is a pretty common thing, particularly some of the materials used in hell with the skulls and bones, bricks sticking out of the ground, that sort of thing, but this is really just speculation I find it pretty hard to tell how a texture's been made without seeing the workflow.
<br /><br />You're probably asking the wrong guy about why tangent space maps vary so much in different apps.
<br />I never really got into using renderbumpflat and I haven't explored many other apps in terms of normalmapping. 3dsmax is all pretty automated as far as baking multiple bumpmaps and normalmaps go, I just drop textures into the map slots and they get rendered out, bumpmaps can be combined with RGBmultiply and some other procedural effects can be applied too, but I havent gotten much more advanced than that, its just something I haven't fully explored yet.
<br />Render to texture in max is really quite simplified compared to some other apps, its not nearly as complicated as Zbrushes Zmapper which opens up a whole new level of complexity for normalmaps.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p175592" date="Posted: Mon Apr 09, 2007 10:52 am "><author>Tron</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Dinky wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">Tron wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Those shots look nice, going to <span style="font-weight: bold">all the effort of modelling all the blades of grass</span> definitely seems to have paid off in terms of the final normalmap.</div><br /><br />I thought before I posted.

Any idea why tangentspace maps vary so much?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p175453" date="Posted: Sat Apr 07, 2007 10:22 pm "><author>Dinky</author><body><![CDATA[<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>

						<div class="postbody">Ive been doing a few expirements with grass in 3dsmax8 and getting some pretty convincing results.&#13;<br /><br />I started by baking diffuse, specular, normal and ambient occlusion maps from high poly geometry to get the first layer; the underlying earth and leaves.&#13;<br />The earth is a flat plane with _d, _s and a bump map and the leaves are highpoly models also with the 3 maps applied.&#13;<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img204.imageshack.us/my.php?image=veiwport03cs5.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img204.imageshack.us/img204/3046/veiwport03cs5.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>&#13;<br /><br />After its been baked I use the earth and leaves texture for the base of the next layer where I placed models of grass, twigs, small weeds, and some less dead looking leaves to create a realistic looking ground texture, all these models have the 3 maps also.&#13;<br /><br />I bake it for a second time. All the diffuse, specular and normal maps are combined and the ambient occlusion map is then multiplied onto the diffuse.&#13;<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img204.imageshack.us/my.php?image=veiwport01ew9.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img204.imageshack.us/img204/2315/veiwport01ew9.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>&#13;<br /><br />Wireframe.&#13;<br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img204.imageshack.us/my.php?image=veiwport02oe7.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img204.imageshack.us/img204/8355/veiwport02oe7.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>&#13;<br /><br />One reason I baked it twice is because; If I dont divide up the work like this my pc will simply run out of virtual memory and grind to a halt, im sure alot of you have more up to date computers than I do so it may not be a problem.&#13;<br />Another reason is that I can build upon the leaves base texture multiple times to create many variants of ground textures to be used for vertex blended terrain and ultimatly megatexture.&#13;<br /><br /><br />Heres the final result in quake4, the textures are 1024, and Ive put a single light above where the player is standing in these pics, theres a few specular highlights which were put in unintentually but Ive grown to like them, it makes the grass look wet like a morning dew in low light conditions and they disapear when the lights are brighter.&#13;<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img204.imageshack.us/my.php?image=shot00091mq9.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img204.imageshack.us/img204/3472/shot00091mq9.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img204.imageshack.us/my.php?image=shot00090lf8.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img204.imageshack.us/img204/2816/shot00090lf8.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a></div>

						<div class="postbody">so it's layers of grass/ground on top of each other in the level (physically on top of each other, like layers of patchs)?  I did something similar in a Q4 CTF map I made a while ago.  The results weren't bad but it still didn't look as nice as having grass stand up from the ground (ala Stalker or Serious Sam).&#13;<br /><br />Still looks better then flat land though.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>

						<div class="postbody">No, thats just one material, the layers I refered to were baked together in max, Ill still have to make some alpha planes for taller grass, but I think I wont need as much because of the amount of detail already in the ground material.&#13;<br />It definitly renders much better in a night time scene especially with a flashlight because all the normals adjacent to the player get lit up and that creates the illusion of them standing up strait no matter what direction they're veiwed from.</div>

						<div class="postbody">cheers for the feedback&#13;<br />I just got asked a few questions about making the grass and I thought that they might be useful here.&#13;<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"> <br />I was wondering if you are having to use photoshop to get your texture to tile, or if there's something you are doing before baking. <br /></div><br /><br />I found getting this texture to tile nicely quite tricky, If I had a more powerful machine I could have used 9 instances set up on a grid (3 by 3) and projected the centre one, if anyone has any ideas regarding that id love to hear them but heres how I did it;<br /><br /> Once I was happy with the grass I made a copy, (the grass is made up of lots of clumps of various shapes and sizes, and the other weeds are individual models aswell.)<br /><br /> I then selected all the models around the edges of the copy (all the ones that over lapped the edge of the projection plane) keeping locked to the grid, I then copied the models to their opposite sides. <br /><br /> if you check out step 4.4 of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=17688" class="postlink">this tutoria</a>you should see what I mean, except in the case of the grass it must tile on both axis and it was a bit more fiddly because the models are more complex and there are more of them too.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I'd also like to know what kind of lighting setup you are using for baking. <br /></div>&#13;<br /><br />theres no lighting setup at all, I rendered 2 ambient occlusion maps, one for each layer</div>

						<div class="postbody">What's everyone talking about? Everyone's heard of this.... From what I'm seeing this just looks like information being baked onto a single polygon from a higher resolution model... Doom 3 can do this with Renderbump...&#13;<br /><br />And I don't know about 3dsmax, but in Maya the grass and stuff can all be created very easily using Maya's Paint tools which allow you to paint a curve and apply objects to them, and later you can turn them into geometry if you like (which you would have to if you wanted to bake them into a material like this). What's really cool about this tool is that you could model your own 3d objects (more than one normally to create variation) then tell Maya you want your objects to be placed in Maya's Paint Tool Library, and you can paint your own objects instead of painting Maya's default load out (which are awesome without any custom addition anyway).&#13;<br /><br />I'm not saying Mikebart did a bad job or anything, I think it was awesome he took the time to get this down but it's not THAT hard because I'm sure he didn't have to model every individual grass thingy. I just want to be clear I'm not trying to put someone's work down, but infact I think it looks really great and the result is better than I would've imagined, but it's not as hard as some people are making it out to be here.&#13;<br /><br />Nice job though ^_^.</div>

						<div class="postbody">While renderbumpflat isn't anything new, the devil's in the details with this stuff. When you actually sit down and attempt to make one of these things- especially something unusual, you have to make a ton of little choices that make or break the final result. I think the big news here is using traditional photoshop/texture techniques like mirroring borders in a 3d modeling package. Also, using normal mapped geometry in your highpoly model adds another level of complexity that you haven't seen in quake4 or d3. I think the only packages that do this are maya and 3dsmax? I've never used lightwave's solution, but i know renderbump and modo don't. &#13;<br /><br />Leads me to another question- your 3ds max normalmaps look great- i haven't had so much success in modo or maya generated maps, so i've been sticking to renderbump/flat, which means a lot of material writing while i'm working. Any idea why tangentspace maps vary so much?</div>

<br /><br />I started by baking diffuse, specular, normal and ambient occlusion maps from high poly geometry to get the first layer; the underlying earth and leaves.
<br />The earth is a flat plane with _d, _s and a bump map and the leaves are highpoly models also with the 3 maps applied.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img204.imageshack.us/my.php?image=veiwport03cs5.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img204.imageshack.us/img204/3046/veiwport03cs5.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />After its been baked I use the earth and leaves texture for the base of the next layer where I placed models of grass, twigs, small weeds, and some less dead looking leaves to create a realistic looking ground texture, all these models have the 3 maps also.
<br /><br />I bake it for a second time. All the diffuse, specular and normal maps are combined and the ambient occlusion map is then multiplied onto the diffuse.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img204.imageshack.us/my.php?image=veiwport01ew9.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img204.imageshack.us/img204/2315/veiwport01ew9.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>

<br /><br />One reason I baked it twice is because; If I dont divide up the work like this my pc will simply run out of virtual memory and grind to a halt, im sure alot of you have more up to date computers than I do so it may not be a problem.
<br />Another reason is that I can build upon the leaves base texture multiple times to create many variants of ground textures to be used for vertex blended terrain and ultimatly megatexture.
<br /><br /><br />Heres the final result in quake4, the textures are 1024, and Ive put a single light above where the player is standing in these pics, theres a few specular highlights which were put in unintentually but Ive grown to like them, it makes the grass look wet like a morning dew in low light conditions and they disapear when the lights are brighter.

<br />I just got asked a few questions about making the grass and I thought that they might be useful here.
<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"> <br />I was wondering if you are having to use photoshop to get your texture to tile, or if there's something you are doing before baking. <br /></div><br /><br />I found getting this texture to tile nicely quite tricky, If I had a more powerful machine I could have used 9 instances set up on a grid (3 by 3) and projected the centre one, if anyone has any ideas regarding that id love to hear them but heres how I did it;<br /><br /> Once I was happy with the grass I made a copy, (the grass is made up of lots of clumps of various shapes and sizes, and the other weeds are individual models aswell.)<br /><br /> I then selected all the models around the edges of the copy (all the ones that over lapped the edge of the projection plane) keeping locked to the grid, I then copied the models to their opposite sides. <br /><br /> if you check out step 4.4 of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=17688" class="postlink">this tutoria</a>you should see what I mean, except in the case of the grass it must tile on both axis and it was a bit more fiddly because the models are more complex and there are more of them too.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I'd also like to know what kind of lighting setup you are using for baking. <br /></div>
<br /><br />theres no lighting setup at all, I rendered 2 ambient occlusion maps, one for each layer</div>]]></body></post><post id="p175256" date="Posted: Thu Apr 05, 2007 3:23 pm "><author>BJA</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Seems that it was quite a lot of work but I think it was worth it.

<br /><br />There is an over-reliance on photo-wrapping everything these days, in my opinion. It can look great, but there's something to be said for how building assets up like this helps everything appear as if it is made from the same "stuff."</div>]]></body></post><post id="p175263" date="Posted: Thu Apr 05, 2007 3:37 pm "><author>Dinky</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">What's everyone talking about? Everyone's heard of this.... From what I'm seeing this just looks like information being baked onto a single polygon from a higher resolution model... Doom 3 can do this with Renderbump...
<br /><br />And I don't know about 3dsmax, but in Maya the grass and stuff can all be created very easily using Maya's Paint tools which allow you to paint a curve and apply objects to them, and later you can turn them into geometry if you like (which you would have to if you wanted to bake them into a material like this). What's really cool about this tool is that you could model your own 3d objects (more than one normally to create variation) then tell Maya you want your objects to be placed in Maya's Paint Tool Library, and you can paint your own objects instead of painting Maya's default load out (which are awesome without any custom addition anyway).
<br /><br />I'm not saying Mikebart did a bad job or anything, I think it was awesome he took the time to get this down but it's not THAT hard because I'm sure he didn't have to model every individual grass thingy. I just want to be clear I'm not trying to put someone's work down, but infact I think it looks really great and the result is better than I would've imagined, but it's not as hard as some people are making it out to be here.

<br />I've just read through the whole thread again and im looking hard to find any posts indicating that somebody thought I modeled each blade of grass individualy, thats just ridiculous Dinky <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /><br />Think before you post man.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p175435" date="Posted: Sat Apr 07, 2007 8:18 pm "><author>parsonsbear</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">While renderbumpflat isn't anything new, the devil's in the details with this stuff. When you actually sit down and attempt to make one of these things- especially something unusual, you have to make a ton of little choices that make or break the final result. I think the big news here is using traditional photoshop/texture techniques like mirroring borders in a 3d modeling package. Also, using normal mapped geometry in your highpoly model adds another level of complexity that you haven't seen in quake4 or d3. I think the only packages that do this are maya and 3dsmax? I've never used lightwave's solution, but i know renderbump and modo don't. 
<br /><br />Leads me to another question- your 3ds max normalmaps look great- i haven't had so much success in modo or maya generated maps, so i've been sticking to renderbump/flat, which means a lot of material writing while i'm working. Any idea why tangentspace maps vary so much?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p175075" date="Posted: Wed Apr 04, 2007 5:12 am "><author>mikebart</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Ive been doing a few expirements with grass in 3dsmax8 and getting some pretty convincing results.

<br /><br />And I don't know about 3dsmax, but in Maya the grass and stuff can all be created very easily using Maya's Paint tools which allow you to paint a curve and apply objects to them, and later you can turn them into geometry if you like (which you would have to if you wanted to bake them into a material like this). What's really cool about this tool is that you could model your own 3d objects (more than one normally to create variation) then tell Maya you want your objects to be placed in Maya's Paint Tool Library, and you can paint your own objects instead of painting Maya's default load out (which are awesome without any custom addition anyway).

<br />I've just read through the whole thread again and im looking hard to find any posts indicating that somebody thought I modeled each blade of grass individualy, thats just ridiculous Dinky <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /><br />Think before you post man.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p175435" date="Posted: Sat Apr 07, 2007 8:18 pm "><author>parsonsbear</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">While renderbumpflat isn't anything new, the devil's in the details with this stuff. When you actually sit down and attempt to make one of these things- especially something unusual, you have to make a ton of little choices that make or break the final result. I think the big news here is using traditional photoshop/texture techniques like mirroring borders in a 3d modeling package. Also, using normal mapped geometry in your highpoly model adds another level of complexity that you haven't seen in quake4 or d3. I think the only packages that do this are maya and 3dsmax? I've never used lightwave's solution, but i know renderbump and modo don't. 
<br /><br />Leads me to another question- your 3ds max normalmaps look great- i haven't had so much success in modo or maya generated maps, so i've been sticking to renderbump/flat, which means a lot of material writing while i'm working. Any idea why tangentspace maps vary so much?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p175075" date="Posted: Wed Apr 04, 2007 5:12 am "><author>mikebart</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Ive been doing a few expirements with grass in 3dsmax8 and getting some pretty convincing results.
<br /><br />I started by baking diffuse, specular, normal and ambient occlusion maps from high poly geometry to get the first layer; the underlying earth and leaves.
<br />The earth is a flat plane with _d, _s and a bump map and the leaves are highpoly models also with the 3 maps applied.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img204.imageshack.us/my.php?image=veiwport03cs5.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img204.imageshack.us/img204/3046/veiwport03cs5.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />After its been baked I use the earth and leaves texture for the base of the next layer where I placed models of grass, twigs, small weeds, and some less dead looking leaves to create a realistic looking ground texture, all these models have the 3 maps also.
<br /><br />I bake it for a second time. All the diffuse, specular and normal maps are combined and the ambient occlusion map is then multiplied onto the diffuse.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img204.imageshack.us/my.php?image=veiwport01ew9.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img204.imageshack.us/img204/2315/veiwport01ew9.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />Wireframe.

<br /><br />One reason I baked it twice is because; If I dont divide up the work like this my pc will simply run out of virtual memory and grind to a halt, im sure alot of you have more up to date computers than I do so it may not be a problem.
<br />Another reason is that I can build upon the leaves base texture multiple times to create many variants of ground textures to be used for vertex blended terrain and ultimatly megatexture.
<br /><br /><br />Heres the final result in quake4, the textures are 1024, and Ive put a single light above where the player is standing in these pics, theres a few specular highlights which were put in unintentually but Ive grown to like them, it makes the grass look wet like a morning dew in low light conditions and they disapear when the lights are brighter.

<br /><br />I started by baking diffuse, specular, normal and ambient occlusion maps from high poly geometry to get the first layer; the underlying earth and leaves.
<br />The earth is a flat plane with _d, _s and a bump map and the leaves are highpoly models also with the 3 maps applied.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img204.imageshack.us/my.php?image=veiwport03cs5.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img204.imageshack.us/img204/3046/veiwport03cs5.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />After its been baked I use the earth and leaves texture for the base of the next layer where I placed models of grass, twigs, small weeds, and some less dead looking leaves to create a realistic looking ground texture, all these models have the 3 maps also.
<br /><br />I bake it for a second time. All the diffuse, specular and normal maps are combined and the ambient occlusion map is then multiplied onto the diffuse.

<br /><br />One reason I baked it twice is because; If I dont divide up the work like this my pc will simply run out of virtual memory and grind to a halt, im sure alot of you have more up to date computers than I do so it may not be a problem.
<br />Another reason is that I can build upon the leaves base texture multiple times to create many variants of ground textures to be used for vertex blended terrain and ultimatly megatexture.
<br /><br /><br />Heres the final result in quake4, the textures are 1024, and Ive put a single light above where the player is standing in these pics, theres a few specular highlights which were put in unintentually but Ive grown to like them, it makes the grass look wet like a morning dew in low light conditions and they disapear when the lights are brighter.

<br />I just got asked a few questions about making the grass and I thought that they might be useful here.
<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"> <br />I was wondering if you are having to use photoshop to get your texture to tile, or if there's something you are doing before baking. <br /></div><br /><br />I found getting this texture to tile nicely quite tricky, If I had a more powerful machine I could have used 9 instances set up on a grid (3 by 3) and projected the centre one, if anyone has any ideas regarding that id love to hear them but heres how I did it;<br /><br /> Once I was happy with the grass I made a copy, (the grass is made up of lots of clumps of various shapes and sizes, and the other weeds are individual models aswell.)<br /><br /> I then selected all the models around the edges of the copy (all the ones that over lapped the edge of the projection plane) keeping locked to the grid, I then copied the models to their opposite sides. <br /><br /> if you check out step 4.4 of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=17688" class="postlink">this tutoria</a>you should see what I mean, except in the case of the grass it must tile on both axis and it was a bit more fiddly because the models are more complex and there are more of them too.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I'd also like to know what kind of lighting setup you are using for baking. <br /></div>
<br /><br />theres no lighting setup at all, I rendered 2 ambient occlusion maps, one for each layer</div>]]></body></post><post id="p175256" date="Posted: Thu Apr 05, 2007 3:23 pm "><author>BJA</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Seems that it was quite a lot of work but I think it was worth it.

<br /><br />There is an over-reliance on photo-wrapping everything these days, in my opinion.

<br /><br />And I don't know about 3dsmax, but in Maya the grass and stuff can all be created very easily using Maya's Paint tools which allow you to paint a curve and apply objects to them, and later you can turn them into geometry if you like (which you would have to if you wanted to bake them into a material like this).

<br /><br />And I don't know about 3dsmax, but in Maya the grass and stuff can all be created very easily using Maya's Paint tools which allow you to paint a curve and apply objects to them, and later you can turn them into geometry if you like (which you would have to if you wanted to bake them into a material like this). What's really cool about this tool is that you could model your own 3d objects (more than one normally to create variation) then tell Maya you want your objects to be placed in Maya's Paint Tool Library, and you can paint your own objects instead of painting Maya's default load out (which are awesome without any custom addition anyway).

<br />I've just read through the whole thread again and im looking hard to find any posts indicating that somebody thought I modeled each blade of grass individualy, thats just ridiculous Dinky <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /><br />Think before you post man.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p175435" date="Posted: Sat Apr 07, 2007 8:18 pm "><author>parsonsbear</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">While renderbumpflat isn't anything new, the devil's in the details with this stuff. When you actually sit down and attempt to make one of these things- especially something unusual, you have to make a ton of little choices that make or break the final result. I think the big news here is using traditional photoshop/texture techniques like mirroring borders in a 3d modeling package. Also, using normal mapped geometry in your highpoly model adds another level of complexity that you haven't seen in quake4 or d3. I think the only packages that do this are maya and 3dsmax? I've never used lightwave's solution, but i know renderbump and modo don't. 
<br /><br />Leads me to another question- your 3ds max normalmaps look great- i haven't had so much success in modo or maya generated maps, so i've been sticking to renderbump/flat, which means a lot of material writing while i'm working. Any idea why tangentspace maps vary so much?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p175075" date="Posted: Wed Apr 04, 2007 5:12 am "><author>mikebart</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Ive been doing a few expirements with grass in 3dsmax8 and getting some pretty convincing results.
<br /><br />I started by baking diffuse, specular, normal and ambient occlusion maps from high poly geometry to get the first layer; the underlying earth and leaves.
<br />The earth is a flat plane with _d, _s and a bump map and the leaves are highpoly models also with the 3 maps applied.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img204.imageshack.us/my.php?image=veiwport03cs5.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img204.imageshack.us/img204/3046/veiwport03cs5.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />After its been baked I use the earth and leaves texture for the base of the next layer where I placed models of grass, twigs, small weeds, and some less dead looking leaves to create a realistic looking ground texture, all these models have the 3 maps also.
<br /><br />I bake it for a second time. All the diffuse, specular and normal maps are combined and the ambient occlusion map is then multiplied onto the diffuse.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img204.imageshack.us/my.php?image=veiwport01ew9.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img204.imageshack.us/img204/2315/veiwport01ew9.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />Wireframe.

<br /><br />One reason I baked it twice is because; If I dont divide up the work like this my pc will simply run out of virtual memory and grind to a halt, im sure alot of you have more up to date computers than I do so it may not be a problem.
<br />Another reason is that I can build upon the leaves base texture multiple times to create many variants of ground textures to be used for vertex blended terrain and ultimatly megatexture.
<br /><br /><br />Heres the final result in quake4, the textures are 1024, and Ive put a single light above where the player is standing in these pics, theres a few specular highlights which were put in unintentually but Ive grown to like them, it makes the grass look wet like a morning dew in low light conditions and they disapear when the lights are brighter.

<br /><br />I started by baking diffuse, specular, normal and ambient occlusion maps from high poly geometry to get the first layer; the underlying earth and leaves.
<br />The earth is a flat plane with _d, _s and a bump map and the leaves are highpoly models also with the 3 maps applied.

<br /><br />One reason I baked it twice is because; If I dont divide up the work like this my pc will simply run out of virtual memory and grind to a halt, im sure alot of you have more up to date computers than I do so it may not be a problem.
<br />Another reason is that I can build upon the leaves base texture multiple times to create many variants of ground textures to be used for vertex blended terrain and ultimatly megatexture.
<br /><br /><br />Heres the final result in quake4, the textures are 1024, and Ive put a single light above where the player is standing in these pics, theres a few specular highlights which were put in unintentually but Ive grown to like them, it makes the grass look wet like a morning dew in low light conditions and they disapear when the lights are brighter.

<br /><br />And I don't know about 3dsmax, but in Maya the grass and stuff can all be created very easily using Maya's Paint tools which allow you to paint a curve and apply objects to them, and later you can turn them into geometry if you like (which you would have to if you wanted to bake them into a material like this). What's really cool about this tool is that you could model your own 3d objects (more than one normally to create variation) then tell Maya you want your objects to be placed in Maya's Paint Tool Library, and you can paint your own objects instead of painting Maya's default load out (which are awesome without any custom addition anyway).

<br />I've just read through the whole thread again and im looking hard to find any posts indicating that somebody thought I modeled each blade of grass individualy, thats just ridiculous Dinky <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /><br />Think before you post man.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p175435" date="Posted: Sat Apr 07, 2007 8:18 pm "><author>parsonsbear</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">While renderbumpflat isn't anything new, the devil's in the details with this stuff. When you actually sit down and attempt to make one of these things- especially something unusual, you have to make a ton of little choices that make or break the final result. I think the big news here is using traditional photoshop/texture techniques like mirroring borders in a 3d modeling package. Also, using normal mapped geometry in your highpoly model adds another level of complexity that you haven't seen in quake4 or d3. I think the only packages that do this are maya and 3dsmax? I've never used lightwave's solution, but i know renderbump and modo don't. 
<br /><br />Leads me to another question- your 3ds max normalmaps look great- i haven't had so much success in modo or maya generated maps, so i've been sticking to renderbump/flat, which means a lot of material writing while i'm working. Any idea why tangentspace maps vary so much?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p175075" date="Posted: Wed Apr 04, 2007 5:12 am "><author>mikebart</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Ive been doing a few expirements with grass in 3dsmax8 and getting some pretty convincing results.
<br /><br />I started by baking diffuse, specular, normal and ambient occlusion maps from high poly geometry to get the first layer; the underlying earth and leaves.
<br />The earth is a flat plane with _d, _s and a bump map and the leaves are highpoly models also with the 3 maps applied.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img204.imageshack.us/my.php?image=veiwport03cs5.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img204.imageshack.us/img204/3046/veiwport03cs5.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />After its been baked I use the earth and leaves texture for the base of the next layer where I placed models of grass, twigs, small weeds, and some less dead looking leaves to create a realistic looking ground texture, all these models have the 3 maps also.
<br /><br />I bake it for a second time. All the diffuse, specular and normal maps are combined and the ambient occlusion map is then multiplied onto the diffuse.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img204.imageshack.us/my.php?image=veiwport01ew9.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img204.imageshack.us/img204/2315/veiwport01ew9.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>

<br /><br />One reason I baked it twice is because; If I dont divide up the work like this my pc will simply run out of virtual memory and grind to a halt, im sure alot of you have more up to date computers than I do so it may not be a problem.
<br />Another reason is that I can build upon the leaves base texture multiple times to create many variants of ground textures to be used for vertex blended terrain and ultimatly megatexture.
<br /><br /><br />Heres the final result in quake4, the textures are 1024, and Ive put a single light above where the player is standing in these pics, theres a few specular highlights which were put in unintentually but Ive grown to like them, it makes the grass look wet like a morning dew in low light conditions and they disapear when the lights are brighter.

All the diffuse, specular and normal maps are combined and the ambient occlusion map is then multiplied onto the diffuse.&#13;<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img204.imageshack.us/my.php?image=veiwport01ew9.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img204.imageshack.us/img204/2315/veiwport01ew9.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>&#13;<br /><br />Wireframe.&#13;<br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img204.imageshack.us/my.php?image=veiwport02oe7.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img204.imageshack.us/img204/8355/veiwport02oe7.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>&#13;<br /><br />One reason I baked it twice is because; If I dont divide up the work like this my pc will simply run out of virtual memory and grind to a halt, im sure alot of you have more up to date computers than I do so it may not be a problem.&#13;<br />Another reason is that I can build upon the leaves base texture multiple times to create many variants of ground textures to be used for vertex blended terrain and ultimatly megatexture.&#13;<br /><br /><br />Heres the final result in quake4, the textures are 1024, and Ive put a single light above where the player is standing in these pics, theres a few specular highlights which were put in unintentually but Ive grown to like them, it makes the grass look wet like a morning dew in low light conditions and they disapear when the lights are brighter.&#13;<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img204.imageshack.us/my.php?image=shot00091mq9.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img204.imageshack.us/img204/3472/shot00091mq9.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img204.imageshack.us/my.php?image=shot00090lf8.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img204.imageshack.us/img204/2816/shot00090lf8.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a></div>]]></body></post><post id="p175076" date="Posted: Wed Apr 04, 2007 5:36 am "><author>The Happy Friar</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">so it's layers of grass/ground on top of each other in the level (physically on top of each other, like layers of patchs)?

						<div class="postbody">Ive been doing a few expirements with grass in 3dsmax8 and getting some pretty convincing results.&#13;<br /><br />I started by baking diffuse, specular, normal and ambient occlusion maps from high poly geometry to get the first layer; the underlying earth and leaves.&#13;<br />The earth is a flat plane with _d, _s and a bump map and the leaves are highpoly models also with the 3 maps applied.&#13;<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img204.imageshack.us/my.php?image=veiwport03cs5.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img204.imageshack.us/img204/3046/veiwport03cs5.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>&#13;<br /><br />After its been baked I use the earth and leaves texture for the base of the next layer where I placed models of grass, twigs, small weeds, and some less dead looking leaves to create a realistic looking ground texture, all these models have the 3 maps also.&#13;<br /><br />I bake it for a second time. All the diffuse, specular and normal maps are combined and the ambient occlusion map is then multiplied onto the diffuse.&#13;<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img204.imageshack.us/my.php?image=veiwport01ew9.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img204.imageshack.us/img204/2315/veiwport01ew9.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>&#13;<br /><br />Wireframe.&#13;<br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img204.imageshack.us/my.php?image=veiwport02oe7.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img204.imageshack.us/img204/8355/veiwport02oe7.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>&#13;<br /><br />One reason I baked it twice is because; If I dont divide up the work like this my pc will simply run out of virtual memory and grind to a halt, im sure alot of you have more up to date computers than I do so it may not be a problem.&#13;<br />Another reason is that I can build upon the leaves base texture multiple times to create many variants of ground textures to be used for vertex blended terrain and ultimatly megatexture.&#13;<br /><br /><br />Heres the final result in quake4, the textures are 1024, and Ive put a single light above where the player is standing in these pics, theres a few specular highlights which were put in unintentually but Ive grown to like them, it makes the grass look wet like a morning dew in low light conditions and they disapear when the lights are brighter.&#13;<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img204.imageshack.us/my.php?image=shot00091mq9.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img204.imageshack.us/img204/3472/shot00091mq9.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img204.imageshack.us/my.php?image=shot00090lf8.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img204.imageshack.us/img204/2816/shot00090lf8.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a></div>

						<div class="postbody">so it's layers of grass/ground on top of each other in the level (physically on top of each other, like layers of patchs)?  I did something similar in a Q4 CTF map I made a while ago.  The results weren't bad but it still didn't look as nice as having grass stand up from the ground (ala Stalker or Serious Sam).&#13;<br /><br />Still looks better then flat land though.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>

						<div class="postbody">No, thats just one material, the layers I refered to were baked together in max, Ill still have to make some alpha planes for taller grass, but I think I wont need as much because of the amount of detail already in the ground material.&#13;<br />It definitly renders much better in a night time scene especially with a flashlight because all the normals adjacent to the player get lit up and that creates the illusion of them standing up strait no matter what direction they're veiwed from.</div>

						<div class="postbody">cheers for the feedback&#13;<br />I just got asked a few questions about making the grass and I thought that they might be useful here.&#13;<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"> <br />I was wondering if you are having to use photoshop to get your texture to tile, or if there's something you are doing before baking. <br /></div><br /><br />I found getting this texture to tile nicely quite tricky, If I had a more powerful machine I could have used 9 instances set up on a grid (3 by 3) and projected the centre one, if anyone has any ideas regarding that id love to hear them but heres how I did it;<br /><br /> Once I was happy with the grass I made a copy, (the grass is made up of lots of clumps of various shapes and sizes, and the other weeds are individual models aswell.)<br /><br /> I then selected all the models around the edges of the copy (all the ones that over lapped the edge of the projection plane) keeping locked to the grid, I then copied the models to their opposite sides. <br /><br /> if you check out step 4.4 of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=17688" class="postlink">this tutoria</a>you should see what I mean, except in the case of the grass it must tile on both axis and it was a bit more fiddly because the models are more complex and there are more of them too.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I'd also like to know what kind of lighting setup you are using for baking. <br /></div>&#13;<br /><br />theres no lighting setup at all, I rendered 2 ambient occlusion maps, one for each layer</div>

						<div class="postbody">What's everyone talking about? Everyone's heard of this.... From what I'm seeing this just looks like information being baked onto a single polygon from a higher resolution model... Doom 3 can do this with Renderbump...&#13;<br /><br />And I don't know about 3dsmax, but in Maya the grass and stuff can all be created very easily using Maya's Paint tools which allow you to paint a curve and apply objects to them, and later you can turn them into geometry if you like (which you would have to if you wanted to bake them into a material like this). What's really cool about this tool is that you could model your own 3d objects (more than one normally to create variation) then tell Maya you want your objects to be placed in Maya's Paint Tool Library, and you can paint your own objects instead of painting Maya's default load out (which are awesome without any custom addition anyway).&#13;<br /><br />I'm not saying Mikebart did a bad job or anything, I think it was awesome he took the time to get this down but it's not THAT hard because I'm sure he didn't have to model every individual grass thingy. I just want to be clear I'm not trying to put someone's work down, but infact I think it looks really great and the result is better than I would've imagined, but it's not as hard as some people are making it out to be here.&#13;<br /><br />Nice job though ^_^.</div>

						<div class="postbody">While renderbumpflat isn't anything new, the devil's in the details with this stuff. When you actually sit down and attempt to make one of these things- especially something unusual, you have to make a ton of little choices that make or break the final result. I think the big news here is using traditional photoshop/texture techniques like mirroring borders in a 3d modeling package. Also, using normal mapped geometry in your highpoly model adds another level of complexity that you haven't seen in quake4 or d3. I think the only packages that do this are maya and 3dsmax? I've never used lightwave's solution, but i know renderbump and modo don't. &#13;<br /><br />Leads me to another question- your 3ds max normalmaps look great- i haven't had so much success in modo or maya generated maps, so i've been sticking to renderbump/flat, which means a lot of material writing while i'm working. Any idea why tangentspace maps vary so much?</div>

<br /><br />I started by baking diffuse, specular, normal and ambient occlusion maps from high poly geometry to get the first layer; the underlying earth and leaves.
<br />The earth is a flat plane with _d, _s and a bump map and the leaves are highpoly models also with the 3 maps applied.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img204.imageshack.us/my.php?image=veiwport03cs5.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img204.imageshack.us/img204/3046/veiwport03cs5.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />After its been baked I use the earth and leaves texture for the base of the next layer where I placed models of grass, twigs, small weeds, and some less dead looking leaves to create a realistic looking ground texture, all these models have the 3 maps also.
<br /><br />I bake it for a second time. All the diffuse, specular and normal maps are combined and the ambient occlusion map is then multiplied onto the diffuse.

<br /><br />One reason I baked it twice is because; If I dont divide up the work like this my pc will simply run out of virtual memory and grind to a halt, im sure alot of you have more up to date computers than I do so it may not be a problem.
<br />Another reason is that I can build upon the leaves base texture multiple times to create many variants of ground textures to be used for vertex blended terrain and ultimatly megatexture.
<br /><br /><br />Heres the final result in quake4, the textures are 1024, and Ive put a single light above where the player is standing in these pics, theres a few specular highlights which were put in unintentually but Ive grown to like them, it makes the grass look wet like a morning dew in low light conditions and they disapear when the lights are brighter.

<br />I just got asked a few questions about making the grass and I thought that they might be useful here.
<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"> <br />I was wondering if you are having to use photoshop to get your texture to tile, or if there's something you are doing before baking. <br /></div><br /><br />I found getting this texture to tile nicely quite tricky, If I had a more powerful machine I could have used 9 instances set up on a grid (3 by 3) and projected the centre one, if anyone has any ideas regarding that id love to hear them but heres how I did it;<br /><br /> Once I was happy with the grass I made a copy, (the grass is made up of lots of clumps of various shapes and sizes, and the other weeds are individual models aswell.)<br /><br /> I then selected all the models around the edges of the copy (all the ones that over lapped the edge of the projection plane) keeping locked to the grid, I then copied the models to their opposite sides. <br /><br /> if you check out step 4.4 of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=17688" class="postlink">this tutoria</a>you should see what I mean, except in the case of the grass it must tile on both axis and it was a bit more fiddly because the models are more complex and there are more of them too.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I'd also like to know what kind of lighting setup you are using for baking. <br /></div>
<br /><br />theres no lighting setup at all, I rendered 2 ambient occlusion maps, one for each layer</div>]]></body></post><post id="p175256" date="Posted: Thu Apr 05, 2007 3:23 pm "><author>BJA</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Seems that it was quite a lot of work but I think it was worth it.

<br /><br />There is an over-reliance on photo-wrapping everything these days, in my opinion. It can look great, but there's something to be said for how building assets up like this helps everything appear as if it is made from the same "stuff."</div>]]></body></post><post id="p175263" date="Posted: Thu Apr 05, 2007 3:37 pm "><author>Dinky</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">What's everyone talking about? Everyone's heard of this.... From what I'm seeing this just looks like information being baked onto a single polygon from a higher resolution model... Doom 3 can do this with Renderbump...
<br /><br />And I don't know about 3dsmax, but in Maya the grass and stuff can all be created very easily using Maya's Paint tools which allow you to paint a curve and apply objects to them, and later you can turn them into geometry if you like (which you would have to if you wanted to bake them into a material like this). What's really cool about this tool is that you could model your own 3d objects (more than one normally to create variation) then tell Maya you want your objects to be placed in Maya's Paint Tool Library, and you can paint your own objects instead of painting Maya's default load out (which are awesome without any custom addition anyway).
<br /><br />I'm not saying Mikebart did a bad job or anything, I think it was awesome he took the time to get this down but it's not THAT hard because I'm sure he didn't have to model every individual grass thingy. I just want to be clear I'm not trying to put someone's work down, but infact I think it looks really great and the result is better than I would've imagined, but it's not as hard as some people are making it out to be here.

<br /><br />Well, im glad you found that amusing, lets just try and be real about this, 
<br />I've just read through the whole thread again and im looking hard to find any posts indicating that somebody thought I modeled each blade of grass individualy, thats just ridiculous Dinky <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /><br />Think before you post man.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p175435" date="Posted: Sat Apr 07, 2007 8:18 pm "><author>parsonsbear</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">While renderbumpflat isn't anything new, the devil's in the details with this stuff. When you actually sit down and attempt to make one of these things- especially something unusual, you have to make a ton of little choices that make or break the final result. I think the big news here is using traditional photoshop/texture techniques like mirroring borders in a 3d modeling package. Also, using normal mapped geometry in your highpoly model adds another level of complexity that you haven't seen in quake4 or d3. I think the only packages that do this are maya and 3dsmax? I've never used lightwave's solution, but i know renderbump and modo don't. 
<br /><br />Leads me to another question- your 3ds max normalmaps look great- i haven't had so much success in modo or maya generated maps, so i've been sticking to renderbump/flat, which means a lot of material writing while i'm working. Any idea why tangentspace maps vary so much?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p175075" date="Posted: Wed Apr 04, 2007 5:12 am "><author>mikebart</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Ive been doing a few expirements with grass in 3dsmax8 and getting some pretty convincing results.

<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent"> <br />I was wondering if you are having to use photoshop to get your texture to tile, or if there's something you are doing before baking. <br /></div><br /><br />I found getting this texture to tile nicely quite tricky, If I had a more powerful machine I could have used 9 instances set up on a grid (3 by 3) and projected the centre one, if anyone has any ideas regarding that id love to hear them but heres how I did it;<br /><br /> Once I was happy with the grass I made a copy, (the grass is made up of lots of clumps of various shapes and sizes, and the other weeds are individual models aswell.)<br /><br /> I then selected all the models around the edges of the copy (all the ones that over lapped the edge of the projection plane) keeping locked to the grid, I then copied the models to their opposite sides. <br /><br /> if you check out step 4.4 of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=17688" class="postlink">this tutoria</a>you should see what I mean, except in the case of the grass it must tile on both axis and it was a bit more fiddly because the models are more complex and there are more of them too.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I'd also like to know what kind of lighting setup you are using for baking. <br /></div>
<br /><br />theres no lighting setup at all, I rendered 2 ambient occlusion maps, one for each layer</div>]]></body></post><post id="p175256" date="Posted: Thu Apr 05, 2007 3:23 pm "><author>BJA</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Seems that it was quite a lot of work but I think it was worth it.

Everyone's heard of this.... From what I'm seeing this just looks like information being baked onto a single polygon from a higher resolution model... Doom 3 can do this with Renderbump...
<br /><br />And I don't know about 3dsmax, but in Maya the grass and stuff can all be created very easily using Maya's Paint tools which allow you to paint a curve and apply objects to them, and later you can turn them into geometry if you like (which you would have to if you wanted to bake them into a material like this). What's really cool about this tool is that you could model your own 3d objects (more than one normally to create variation) then tell Maya you want your objects to be placed in Maya's Paint Tool Library, and you can paint your own objects instead of painting Maya's default load out (which are awesome without any custom addition anyway).
<br /><br />I'm not saying Mikebart did a bad job or anything, I think it was awesome he took the time to get this down but it's not THAT hard because I'm sure he didn't have to model every individual grass thingy. I just want to be clear I'm not trying to put someone's work down, but infact I think it looks really great and the result is better than I would've imagined, but it's not as hard as some people are making it out to be here.

<br />I've just read through the whole thread again and im looking hard to find any posts indicating that somebody thought I modeled each blade of grass individualy, thats just ridiculous Dinky <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /><br />Think before you post man.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p175435" date="Posted: Sat Apr 07, 2007 8:18 pm "><author>parsonsbear</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">While renderbumpflat isn't anything new, the devil's in the details with this stuff. When you actually sit down and attempt to make one of these things- especially something unusual, you have to make a ton of little choices that make or break the final result. I think the big news here is using traditional photoshop/texture techniques like mirroring borders in a 3d modeling package. Also, using normal mapped geometry in your highpoly model adds another level of complexity that you haven't seen in quake4 or d3. I think the only packages that do this are maya and 3dsmax? I've never used lightwave's solution, but i know renderbump and modo don't. 
<br /><br />Leads me to another question- your 3ds max normalmaps look great- i haven't had so much success in modo or maya generated maps, so i've been sticking to renderbump/flat, which means a lot of material writing while i'm working. Any idea why tangentspace maps vary so much?</div>]]></body></post><post id="175739" date="Posted: Wed Apr 11, 2007 5:59 pm    Post subject: "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<tr><td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">mikebart may not be here to make fans, but I'm happy to say I am one.

@kit89; The grass will appear a bit flat when a light is shining directly onto it because its normal mapped, the ambient occlusion layer does help to give it some depth in those situations, without the ao it definitely would appear much flatter.&#13;
<br/>
You're right about the standing up grass, I still need to create some alphaplaned grass from the highpoly models, having them baked from the same models as the flat texture should really help to blend everything together.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?p=160978#160978" target="_blank" class="postlink">Tutorial; Baking Multiple Maps in 3dsmax8. </a></span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

@Happy friar; Theres a good chance im going to be selling the grass/terrain assets so I cant really hand out the maps, ill try and post some vids of it in action, but what you see in the screens and the descriptions that go with them is pretty much it, with the exception that you'd probably want to drop the resolution to atleast half for todays games.&#13;
<br/><br/>
@kit89; The grass will appear a bit flat when a light is shining directly onto it because its normal mapped, the ambient occlusion layer does help to give it some depth in those situations, without the ao it definitely would appear much flatter.&#13;
<br/>
You're right about the standing up grass, I still need to create some alphaplaned grass from the highpoly models, having them baked from the same models as the flat texture should really help to blend everything together.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?p=160978#160978" target="_blank" class="postlink">Tutorial; Baking Multiple Maps in 3dsmax8. </a></span><span class="gensmall"/></td>
