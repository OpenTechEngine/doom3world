<br /><br />A Bone should appear, place this bone somewhere inside the model. If you want to add more bones select the top of the bone and press "E" to extrude.
<br /><br />Select the model then the Bone. In that exact order. Then press "Ctrl" + "p" to parent them a small dialog window should appear. Saying: "Parent to:" "Armature" &gt; "Name Groups"
<br /><br />You have now parented the Bone to The Model. Now select the model and go to the menus at the bottom. Click on the image that looks like a square with 4 vertices. Go ove to you left and you should see a windows with a few buttons like "Remove" &amp;  "Assign" &amp; a drop down menu with the names of your Bones you have created. 
<br /><br />Select the vertices you want, and select the Bone you want to assign the vertices too, once done press "Assign".
<br /><br />To see if the vertices have been assigned to the specified Bone, select the Bones then go into Pose mode, Select the Bone you want to move and press "G" to move it or "R" to rotate.
<br /><br />If it works just repeat the process.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p164302" date="Posted: Sun Dec 10, 2006 11:23 pm "><author>ajm113</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Now a reply?
