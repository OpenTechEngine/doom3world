Is it Rage, an idMobile project, or something completly different? Has the game been announced? I realize you've most likely singed NDA's and don't want to piss your bosses off this early in the game, that's why I'm keeping the questions vague and about stuff most of us already know, if you can't answer anything I understand. I'm just happy for you, when I play that upcoming game that you're contributing to I can say: "hey, I know those guys!", it just makes the game all that more special to me for some reason.</div>]]></body></post></posts></thread></xml>
