Everything up to this point looks good.&#13;
<br/><br/>
I UVW map the low polygon model. Generating the normal map from 3ds Max and the normal map does not tile along the UVW seam - the normals look mismatched. So I export both models out to ORB and render the normal map from there. ORB does a perfect job, no seams on the normal map.&#13;
<br/><br/>
To test, I import the normal map from ORB into Max and apply it to the low polygon model, and the normal map looks as if it would tile perfectly... no visible seams or anything. However, exporting the model in game, there again, is an obvious edge where ever there is a seam on the UVW map.&#13;
<br/><br/>
From what I can gather...<ul><br/><li>There is no problem with the mesh itself&#13;
<br/></li><li>There is nothing wrong with the normal map I'm using from ORB&#13;
<br/></li><li>There is probably something wrong with the UVW map seams and I have to "weld" them somehow so Max recognizes that it should be a "soft" edge</li></ul><br/><br/>
I don't know how I should do this, so if anyone has any insights or if you can point me to a handy tutorial that would help.<br/>_________________<br/><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/site/img/d3w.gif" border="0"/>The Obsidian Order | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://quake3world.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=10" target="_blank" class="postlink">Q3W LEM</a></span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

High poly and low poly models (they are usually occupying the same space, but I moved them around for illustrative purposes)&#13;

You can see where I have the UVW seams here&#13;
