I do in fact render them out like I would normal maps. It's actually something I did a little bit before but started recently doing in much more detail and it does work great in duplicating the high poly in the game. The shot is of the high poly model in this case though. I haven't actually made the low poly model just yet.<br /><br />I basically try and make the high poly what I want it to be as a final piece and then render out all textures from there. Even though I reserve the option of course to make changes in the texture after rendering them. I like doing this because I always hated painting textures for models and dealing with seams and all that. So this way I can do what I like on the high poly and in the final rendered texture it's all seamless.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p203148" date="Posted: Tue Aug 05, 2008 10:29 am "><author>Kristus</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">obihb wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"> The shot is of the high poly model in this case though.</div><br /><br />Yeah, that's why I asked.<br />Great, now that I know it works.

One way I try and use is to place seams in places where a seam is expected in the object. Trying to paint them out directly on the texture can work to some degree but it's not a great way. Some software can allow you to paint on the model so that is helpful to go and get rid of seams. But then of course it means more software. And then of course some methods of render to texture can help out there even just using the low poly mesh without any high poly to render from.<br /><br />The most hassle free for me is to use render to texture when you have those seams that you just can't put any other place. And you always get those. But the fact is that using render to texture doesn't matter then where you have seams, it will work fine. It's much easier to make the texture look seamless inside Max using some multilayer materials and then render those out to one texture, than sitting and painting stuff out after the fact. But then I don't like painting textures to begin with so it's a preference there for me and not a "rule" really.<br /><br />The other thing I liked about using render to texture is the fact that you can pelt map stuff with less hassle about painting on those maps afterward. They may have some stretches some places and stuff like that, that would affect the texture if it's just mapped on directly. Having this kind of texture that is basically complete, or very near complete it can be enhanced very easily then on top of that. And I even will render out various mapping on one model and then layer them in on already rendered textures, just to build it up in a faster way without having to remake the high poly stuff or whatever. I mean, it's about what is fastest when it comes to that. Works really great when you want to use some procedurally generated stuff. It comes out 100% seamless. <br /><br />I like to use procedurals for mixing and blending things and then that will be seamless. It's also great for painting masks inside the vertex channel and then render them out seamlessly. <br /><br />I think though as with most 3D stuff, it's a matter of preference, a matter of choosing a method with the level of control you need and so on. I don't like to texture stuff so I find shortcuts where I can just to get out of it.. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081117211851im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p203168" date="Posted: Tue Aug 05, 2008 6:13 pm "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">thanks obihb, I'll need to read through your post a few times, but I think I understand the main principles <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081117211851im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p205947" date="Posted: Sat Oct 11, 2008 1:24 pm "><author>Bejiita</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">That chaingun looks like it's taken straight off the old game!<br />It looks perfect!<br />You might also want to try some blue tints on it and post some screens for the fun of it.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p159045" date="Posted: Sat Oct 07, 2006 10:36 am "><author>obihb</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">A while back I got my hands on the Opengl port for the old Wolf3d.

<br /><br />So I'm sort of working on a little Wolf mod when I get the chance. It's actually cool to work on since it is so simple. Following the original game's look and just upgrading the quality of the graphics, in a sense.

If anyone can write a program to convert the Wolf levels into full 3D, with proper normal mapped textures and 3D models, then.. go for it. I have a feeling I'll be done before that person. Anyway, it's not a matter of recreating the levels it's a matter of recreating the graphics that makes the levels.
<br /><br />Once the graphics are made, it'll take less than a day to make one level because of it's simplicity.
<br /><br />So I'm in the process of making the graphics for the first level of the game. Not sure if I'll take it further then that.

<br /><br />I also took what you said Kamikazee, about the squareness. It actually was a decision I made in the beginning to keep it square, although in Wolf all textures are square, it is actually squashed in the game to a rectangle. But what actually happened is that the rooms in my map ended up huge..  too huge really. So I also went back and made it the same there as in Wolf. Works out much better, the scale of the map is more accurate.
<br /><br />Don't have a crap load of new stuff in yet. I spent some time looking at physics objects. So for props, like the plant, tables, chairs, those things could be movable objects.
<br /><br />So just 2 new shots to show some small progress here. Got the level built up into the first big room. I basically build the level and make the models and textures as I need them, so got a few new things to make there.

<br /><br />So I'm sort of working on a little Wolf mod when I get the chance. It's actually cool to work on since it is so simple. Following the original game's look and just upgrading the quality of the graphics, in a sense.

I do in fact render them out like I would normal maps. It's actually something I did a little bit before but started recently doing in much more detail and it does work great in duplicating the high poly in the game. The shot is of the high poly model in this case though. I haven't actually made the low poly model just yet.<br /><br />I basically try and make the high poly what I want it to be as a final piece and then render out all textures from there. Even though I reserve the option of course to make changes in the texture after rendering them. I like doing this because I always hated painting textures for models and dealing with seams and all that. So this way I can do what I like on the high poly and in the final rendered texture it's all seamless.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p203148" date="Posted: Tue Aug 05, 2008 10:29 am "><author>Kristus</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">obihb wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"> The shot is of the high poly model in this case though.</div><br /><br />Yeah, that's why I asked.<br />Great, now that I know it works.

One way I try and use is to place seams in places where a seam is expected in the object. Trying to paint them out directly on the texture can work to some degree but it's not a great way. Some software can allow you to paint on the model so that is helpful to go and get rid of seams. But then of course it means more software. And then of course some methods of render to texture can help out there even just using the low poly mesh without any high poly to render from.<br /><br />The most hassle free for me is to use render to texture when you have those seams that you just can't put any other place. And you always get those. But the fact is that using render to texture doesn't matter then where you have seams, it will work fine. It's much easier to make the texture look seamless inside Max using some multilayer materials and then render those out to one texture, than sitting and painting stuff out after the fact. But then I don't like painting textures to begin with so it's a preference there for me and not a "rule" really.<br /><br />The other thing I liked about using render to texture is the fact that you can pelt map stuff with less hassle about painting on those maps afterward. They may have some stretches some places and stuff like that, that would affect the texture if it's just mapped on directly. Having this kind of texture that is basically complete, or very near complete it can be enhanced very easily then on top of that. And I even will render out various mapping on one model and then layer them in on already rendered textures, just to build it up in a faster way without having to remake the high poly stuff or whatever. I mean, it's about what is fastest when it comes to that. Works really great when you want to use some procedurally generated stuff. It comes out 100% seamless. <br /><br />I like to use procedurals for mixing and blending things and then that will be seamless. It's also great for painting masks inside the vertex channel and then render them out seamlessly. <br /><br />I think though as with most 3D stuff, it's a matter of preference, a matter of choosing a method with the level of control you need and so on. I don't like to texture stuff so I find shortcuts where I can just to get out of it.. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205150031im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p203168" date="Posted: Tue Aug 05, 2008 6:13 pm "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">thanks obihb, I'll need to read through your post a few times, but I think I understand the main principles <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205150031im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p205947" date="Posted: Sat Oct 11, 2008 1:24 pm "><author>Bejiita</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">That chaingun looks like it's taken straight off the old game!<br />It looks perfect!<br />You might also want to try some blue tints on it and post some screens for the fun of it.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p223148" date="Posted: Sat Mar 20, 2010 9:09 am "><author>obihb</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Yes, I have all the files but, sorry, no, I don't give that away.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p223262" date="Posted: Thu Mar 25, 2010 12:02 am "><author>adasdasf</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Ok, still hoping you will finish him.<br />Anyway, are you Obihb or Neurological releasing the textures for Wolf3D?

So I started to make some high res textures for it. But then I decided it would be much cooler to actually make a direct remake in the Doom3 engine, since the lighting and shaders are, well.. just so much cooler.
<br /><br />So I'm sort of working on a little Wolf mod when I get the chance. It's actually cool to work on since it is so simple. Following the original game's look and just upgrading the quality of the graphics, in a sense.
<br /><br />Here's 2 shots just to show what I've got going so far. It's the first section of the first level.

If anyone can write a program to convert the Wolf levels into full 3D, with proper normal mapped textures and 3D models, then.. go for it. I have a feeling I'll be done before that person. Anyway, it's not a matter of recreating the levels it's a matter of recreating the graphics that makes the levels.
<br /><br />Once the graphics are made, it'll take less than a day to make one level because of it's simplicity.
<br /><br />So I'm in the process of making the graphics for the first level of the game. Not sure if I'll take it further then that.

<br /><br />I also took what you said Kamikazee, about the squareness. It actually was a decision I made in the beginning to keep it square, although in Wolf all textures are square, it is actually squashed in the game to a rectangle. But what actually happened is that the rooms in my map ended up huge..  too huge really. So I also went back and made it the same there as in Wolf. Works out much better, the scale of the map is more accurate.
<br /><br />Don't have a crap load of new stuff in yet. I spent some time looking at physics objects. So for props, like the plant, tables, chairs, those things could be movable objects.
<br /><br />So just 2 new shots to show some small progress here. Got the level built up into the first big room. I basically build the level and make the models and textures as I need them, so got a few new things to make there.

The one thing I thought of doing is to release existing content and people can do with that what they want and if I get to finishing it the way I wanted, I release the final thing.<br /><br />The other thing is to hold off on releasing anything until I've completed what I set out to do.<br /><br />The real idea behind this really was to make the content rather than making a full mod. I guess I ended up making more stuff by going on to make the model for the guard as well, which never really was the plan, although I had it in the back of my head to maybe do it anyway.<br /><br />But, yeah, I've just left it alone for now, not releasing anything yet. I actually would like more to release it finished. The reason all this is on hold is simply that I'm busy with a real big project for work doing CG and if I do get some time free, I don't do even more CG stuff like modding Doom. Under normal circumstances I would have more time for myself and my own projects.<br /><br />I can't really say when I'll get back to this though. I really don't wanna just kill it, I do want to get it to a release point some time.<br /><br />About the Quake thing, it's in the same boat. Although the reason why I do the Quake stuff is for the monsters. I like to make them and that's about all. Joining the Quake mod team meant I was more obligated to give it preference in stead of doing other stuff, like the Wolf mod. That's the way I see it. But in the end, real work take top spot at this point in time.

I still check this thread from time to time to drool over the screenies (please don't take them down!) and get inspired, so I'll be around to encourage if you ever need it <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225093318im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />I hope that once the Quake mod is done, you will take a couple of months or how much more time is needed to complete the last items and other models. I don't think you'll need to work too much on coding the weapons; the D3 fist, pistol, machinegun and chaingun basically function like updated Wolf3d weapons, so they just need the models and new animations.<br /><br />Oh, and I'm also looking forward to the Quake mod, although I'm not actively checking out progress on that so much. I know it will be exciting to play once it's done.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p202524" date="Posted: Thu Jul 24, 2008 4:49 am "><author>Bejiita</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">How about some status update cuz some serious months have passed since your last comment.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p203110" date="Posted: Mon Aug 04, 2008 7:35 pm "><author>obihb</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Sorry, long time.. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225093318im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />The mod is not exactly dead and I realize that the longer it takes the more interest is lost and so on but I can't do much about that. I have been messing with some little things here and there just a bit recently and made some choices about how the level is put together in the interest of getting maybe some extra detail in general. It's not a huge change in the look of it at all. It's just something that I wanted to mess with since hardware are much better these days at running Doom3.<br /><br />Even though I guess classic Wolfenstein is not really supposed to push your hardware to it's limits.. I guess I'm crazy like that.. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225093318im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />So the mod is still floating around my hard drive and I still put some time towards it now and then. It's one of those things I can't just drop it and I really don't want to even though a lot of time has gone by since I started it. And I really don't usually drag on something like this. I just like it too much to drop it I guess...  it's Wolfenstein!.. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225093318im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />So then, with all that said and just because I haven't posted anything for so long.. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225093318/http://www.open-reset.com/temp/wolf3d_minigun_08.jpg" class="postlink">HERE</a> is a little shot of something I've been working on the side of the other side of other stuff I work on the side of.

I do in fact render them out like I would normal maps. It's actually something I did a little bit before but started recently doing in much more detail and it does work great in duplicating the high poly in the game. The shot is of the high poly model in this case though. I haven't actually made the low poly model just yet.<br /><br />I basically try and make the high poly what I want it to be as a final piece and then render out all textures from there. Even though I reserve the option of course to make changes in the texture after rendering them. I like doing this because I always hated painting textures for models and dealing with seams and all that. So this way I can do what I like on the high poly and in the final rendered texture it's all seamless.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p203148" date="Posted: Tue Aug 05, 2008 11:29 am "><author>Kristus</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">obihb wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"> The shot is of the high poly model in this case though.</div><br /><br />Yeah, that's why I asked.<br />Great, now that I know it works.

One way I try and use is to place seams in places where a seam is expected in the object. Trying to paint them out directly on the texture can work to some degree but it's not a great way. Some software can allow you to paint on the model so that is helpful to go and get rid of seams. But then of course it means more software. And then of course some methods of render to texture can help out there even just using the low poly mesh without any high poly to render from.<br /><br />The most hassle free for me is to use render to texture when you have those seams that you just can't put any other place. And you always get those. But the fact is that using render to texture doesn't matter then where you have seams, it will work fine. It's much easier to make the texture look seamless inside Max using some multilayer materials and then render those out to one texture, than sitting and painting stuff out after the fact. But then I don't like painting textures to begin with so it's a preference there for me and not a "rule" really.<br /><br />The other thing I liked about using render to texture is the fact that you can pelt map stuff with less hassle about painting on those maps afterward. They may have some stretches some places and stuff like that, that would affect the texture if it's just mapped on directly. Having this kind of texture that is basically complete, or very near complete it can be enhanced very easily then on top of that. And I even will render out various mapping on one model and then layer them in on already rendered textures, just to build it up in a faster way without having to remake the high poly stuff or whatever. I mean, it's about what is fastest when it comes to that. Works really great when you want to use some procedurally generated stuff. It comes out 100% seamless. <br /><br />I like to use procedurals for mixing and blending things and then that will be seamless. It's also great for painting masks inside the vertex channel and then render them out seamlessly. <br /><br />I think though as with most 3D stuff, it's a matter of preference, a matter of choosing a method with the level of control you need and so on. I don't like to texture stuff so I find shortcuts where I can just to get out of it.. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225091721im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p203168" date="Posted: Tue Aug 05, 2008 7:13 pm "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">thanks obihb, I'll need to read through your post a few times, but I think I understand the main principles <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225091721im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p205947" date="Posted: Sat Oct 11, 2008 2:24 pm "><author>Bejiita</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">That chaingun looks like it's taken straight off the old game!<br />It looks perfect!<br />You might also want to try some blue tints on it and post some screens for the fun of it.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p210518" date="Posted: Thu Jan 29, 2009 7:15 pm "><author>=FF=Sturm</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">*Killing Spree Resurrection*<br />How is this mod going on?  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225091721im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p210753" date="Posted: Mon Feb 02, 2009 3:20 pm "><author>Neurological</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Oh just noticed this project as I was making a similr thing, but if this is still on progress I just wait for this.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p211415" date="Posted: Tue Feb 17, 2009 7:31 pm "><author>Bejiita</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Neuro, this is definitely dead.<br />You should do that, don't wait for this to get finished, I know it will never be finished.<br />Go ahead and do it yourself if you can.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p211416" date="Posted: Tue Feb 17, 2009 7:43 pm "><author>=FF=Sturm</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">NOooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo...ooo<br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225091721im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_evil.gif" alt=":evil:" title="Evil or Very Mad" /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225091721im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil" /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225091721im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_evil.gif" alt=":evil:" title="Evil or Very Mad" /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225091721im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil" /><br /><br />Edit: Yeah, no.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p211454" date="Posted: Wed Feb 18, 2009 3:02 pm "><author>Neurological</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thats sad it was looking really promising.

So I started to make some high res textures for it. But then I decided it would be much cooler to actually make a direct remake in the Doom3 engine, since the lighting and shaders are, well.. just so much cooler.
<br /><br />So I'm sort of working on a little Wolf mod when I get the chance. It's actually cool to work on since it is so simple. Following the original game's look and just upgrading the quality of the graphics, in a sense.
<br /><br />Here's 2 shots just to show what I've got going so far. It's the first section of the first level.

If anyone can write a program to convert the Wolf levels into full 3D, with proper normal mapped textures and 3D models, then.. go for it. I have a feeling I'll be done before that person. Anyway, it's not a matter of recreating the levels it's a matter of recreating the graphics that makes the levels.
<br /><br />Once the graphics are made, it'll take less than a day to make one level because of it's simplicity.
<br /><br />So I'm in the process of making the graphics for the first level of the game. Not sure if I'll take it further then that.

<br /><br />I also took what you said Kamikazee, about the squareness. It actually was a decision I made in the beginning to keep it square, although in Wolf all textures are square, it is actually squashed in the game to a rectangle. But what actually happened is that the rooms in my map ended up huge..  too huge really. So I also went back and made it the same there as in Wolf. Works out much better, the scale of the map is more accurate.
<br /><br />Don't have a crap load of new stuff in yet. I spent some time looking at physics objects. So for props, like the plant, tables, chairs, those things could be movable objects.
<br /><br />So just 2 new shots to show some small progress here. Got the level built up into the first big room. I basically build the level and make the models and textures as I need them, so got a few new things to make there.

The one thing I thought of doing is to release existing content and people can do with that what they want and if I get to finishing it the way I wanted, I release the final thing.<br /><br />The other thing is to hold off on releasing anything until I've completed what I set out to do.<br /><br />The real idea behind this really was to make the content rather than making a full mod. I guess I ended up making more stuff by going on to make the model for the guard as well, which never really was the plan, although I had it in the back of my head to maybe do it anyway.<br /><br />But, yeah, I've just left it alone for now, not releasing anything yet. I actually would like more to release it finished. The reason all this is on hold is simply that I'm busy with a real big project for work doing CG and if I do get some time free, I don't do even more CG stuff like modding Doom. Under normal circumstances I would have more time for myself and my own projects.<br /><br />I can't really say when I'll get back to this though. I really don't wanna just kill it, I do want to get it to a release point some time.<br /><br />About the Quake thing, it's in the same boat. Although the reason why I do the Quake stuff is for the monsters. I like to make them and that's about all. Joining the Quake mod team meant I was more obligated to give it preference in stead of doing other stuff, like the Wolf mod. That's the way I see it. But in the end, real work take top spot at this point in time.

I still check this thread from time to time to drool over the screenies (please don't take them down!) and get inspired, so I'll be around to encourage if you ever need it <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225093318im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />I hope that once the Quake mod is done, you will take a couple of months or how much more time is needed to complete the last items and other models. I don't think you'll need to work too much on coding the weapons; the D3 fist, pistol, machinegun and chaingun basically function like updated Wolf3d weapons, so they just need the models and new animations.<br /><br />Oh, and I'm also looking forward to the Quake mod, although I'm not actively checking out progress on that so much.

I have been messing with some little things here and there just a bit recently and made some choices about how the level is put together in the interest of getting maybe some extra detail in general. It's not a huge change in the look of it at all. It's just something that I wanted to mess with since hardware are much better these days at running Doom3.<br /><br />Even though I guess classic Wolfenstein is not really supposed to push your hardware to it's limits.. I guess I'm crazy like that.. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225093318im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />So the mod is still floating around my hard drive and I still put some time towards it now and then. It's one of those things I can't just drop it and I really don't want to even though a lot of time has gone by since I started it. And I really don't usually drag on something like this. I just like it too much to drop it I guess...  it's Wolfenstein!.. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225093318im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />So then, with all that said and just because I haven't posted anything for so long.. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225093318/http://www.open-reset.com/temp/wolf3d_minigun_08.jpg" class="postlink">HERE</a> is a little shot of something I've been working on the side of the other side of other stuff I work on the side of.

I do in fact render them out like I would normal maps. It's actually something I did a little bit before but started recently doing in much more detail and it does work great in duplicating the high poly in the game. The shot is of the high poly model in this case though. I haven't actually made the low poly model just yet.<br /><br />I basically try and make the high poly what I want it to be as a final piece and then render out all textures from there. Even though I reserve the option of course to make changes in the texture after rendering them. I like doing this because I always hated painting textures for models and dealing with seams and all that. So this way I can do what I like on the high poly and in the final rendered texture it's all seamless.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p203148" date="Posted: Tue Aug 05, 2008 11:29 am "><author>Kristus</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">obihb wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"> The shot is of the high poly model in this case though.</div><br /><br />Yeah, that's why I asked.<br />Great, now that I know it works.

One way I try and use is to place seams in places where a seam is expected in the object. Trying to paint them out directly on the texture can work to some degree but it's not a great way. Some software can allow you to paint on the model so that is helpful to go and get rid of seams. But then of course it means more software. And then of course some methods of render to texture can help out there even just using the low poly mesh without any high poly to render from.<br /><br />The most hassle free for me is to use render to texture when you have those seams that you just can't put any other place. And you always get those. But the fact is that using render to texture doesn't matter then where you have seams, it will work fine. It's much easier to make the texture look seamless inside Max using some multilayer materials and then render those out to one texture, than sitting and painting stuff out after the fact. But then I don't like painting textures to begin with so it's a preference there for me and not a "rule" really.<br /><br />The other thing I liked about using render to texture is the fact that you can pelt map stuff with less hassle about painting on those maps afterward. They may have some stretches some places and stuff like that, that would affect the texture if it's just mapped on directly. Having this kind of texture that is basically complete, or very near complete it can be enhanced very easily then on top of that. And I even will render out various mapping on one model and then layer them in on already rendered textures, just to build it up in a faster way without having to remake the high poly stuff or whatever. I mean, it's about what is fastest when it comes to that. Works really great when you want to use some procedurally generated stuff. It comes out 100% seamless. <br /><br />I like to use procedurals for mixing and blending things and then that will be seamless. It's also great for painting masks inside the vertex channel and then render them out seamlessly. <br /><br />I think though as with most 3D stuff, it's a matter of preference, a matter of choosing a method with the level of control you need and so on. I don't like to texture stuff so I find shortcuts where I can just to get out of it.. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225091721im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p203168" date="Posted: Tue Aug 05, 2008 7:13 pm "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">thanks obihb, I'll need to read through your post a few times, but I think I understand the main principles <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225091721im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p205947" date="Posted: Sat Oct 11, 2008 2:24 pm "><author>Bejiita</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">That chaingun looks like it's taken straight off the old game!<br />It looks perfect!<br />You might also want to try some blue tints on it and post some screens for the fun of it.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p210518" date="Posted: Thu Jan 29, 2009 7:15 pm "><author>=FF=Sturm</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">*Killing Spree Resurrection*<br />How is this mod going on?  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225091721im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p210753" date="Posted: Mon Feb 02, 2009 3:20 pm "><author>Neurological</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Oh just noticed this project as I was making a similr thing, but if this is still on progress I just wait for this.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p211415" date="Posted: Tue Feb 17, 2009 7:31 pm "><author>Bejiita</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Neuro, this is definitely dead.<br />You should do that, don't wait for this to get finished, I know it will never be finished.<br />Go ahead and do it yourself if you can.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p211416" date="Posted: Tue Feb 17, 2009 7:43 pm "><author>=FF=Sturm</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">NOooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo...ooo<br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225091721im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_evil.gif" alt=":evil:" title="Evil or Very Mad" /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225091721im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil" /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225091721im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_evil.gif" alt=":evil:" title="Evil or Very Mad" /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225091721im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil" /><br /><br />Edit: Yeah, no.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p211454" date="Posted: Wed Feb 18, 2009 3:02 pm "><author>Neurological</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thats sad it was looking really promising.

<br /><br />So I'm sort of working on a little Wolf mod when I get the chance. It's actually cool to work on since it is so simple. Following the original game's look and just upgrading the quality of the graphics, in a sense.
<br /><br />Here's 2 shots just to show what I've got going so far. It's the first section of the first level.

If anyone can write a program to convert the Wolf levels into full 3D, with proper normal mapped textures and 3D models, then.. go for it. I have a feeling I'll be done before that person. Anyway, it's not a matter of recreating the levels it's a matter of recreating the graphics that makes the levels.
<br /><br />Once the graphics are made, it'll take less than a day to make one level because of it's simplicity.
<br /><br />So I'm in the process of making the graphics for the first level of the game. Not sure if I'll take it further then that.

<br /><br />I also took what you said Kamikazee, about the squareness. It actually was a decision I made in the beginning to keep it square, although in Wolf all textures are square, it is actually squashed in the game to a rectangle. But what actually happened is that the rooms in my map ended up huge..  too huge really. So I also went back and made it the same there as in Wolf. Works out much better, the scale of the map is more accurate.
<br /><br />Don't have a crap load of new stuff in yet. I spent some time looking at physics objects. So for props, like the plant, tables, chairs, those things could be movable objects.
<br /><br />So just 2 new shots to show some small progress here. Got the level built up into the first big room. I basically build the level and make the models and textures as I need them, so got a few new things to make there.

I'm not sure yet what I'm doing about enemy sounds. They are not as "usable" as normal sound effects since they're supposed to be voices. So that one is sort of not decided yet. Of course I will test them and see what works.&#13;<br /><br />Weapons and those things although not able to compare to todays standards, they still sound good and very distinctive of Wolf. It'll be hard for me to replace them completely unless it's by something that sounds very much like it. In my opinion pretty much all sounds are fine accept the enemy sounds may not be. But maybe it's fun to hear those sounds.&#13;<br /><br />The problem for me is I can make graphics but not sounds, so I use the old ones. The other problem is that if anyone did want to make sounds for this they would have to make them all and not just some of them and just quit. I won't accept half way stuff. So sound is maybe neglected by me for this reason but it's important to me that it sounds like Wolf. So using the old sound is by no means a bad thing for me, it's really just that it's my only choice.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p175683" date="Posted: Tue Apr 10, 2007 4:53 pm "><author>Bo$bevok</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">the soldier looks great...&#13;<br /><br />as for sounds i think you should just keep going as you are and worry abou them after you have all the other stuff done...&#13;<br /><br />keep going and have fun.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p175695" date="Posted: Tue Apr 10, 2007 9:24 pm "><author>Kristus</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I still thinks it looks like a guy in beige suit with riding pants and boots and a helmet on it's head...

Heck, if I don't like that when I try the mod, then maybe I should make an effort to obtain some sounds and have them incorporated into the mod myself instead of being a whiny bitch  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070911020632im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /><br /><br />Now, if you add in attack dogs (small, weak versions of the pinky perhaps?), you'd have made my day.

<br /><br /><br />The swastica is illegal to show in Germany, for obvious reasons, so it's not people just being funny they had to make two versions if they wanted to sell the game in Germany, which is a big market.  There are a lot of Germans who were perfectly happy to kill Nazis with the Nazi logo on them, but you can't argue with a government on such things.
<br /><br />On the subject of the mod, I'm loving those walls, they really do look 3D.

I am not gonna change it though. If people can play through Doom3 with satanic symbols all over the place, because it's hell taking over a base, then play Wolf with Nazi stuff in there since it's a Nazi castle.
<br /><br />I don't put the stuff in there to make people angry, it's part of Wolfenstein3D so I keep it.

The one thing I thought of doing is to release existing content and people can do with that what they want and if I get to finishing it the way I wanted, I release the final thing.<br /><br />The other thing is to hold off on releasing anything until I've completed what I set out to do.<br /><br />The real idea behind this really was to make the content rather than making a full mod. I guess I ended up making more stuff by going on to make the model for the guard as well, which never really was the plan, although I had it in the back of my head to maybe do it anyway.<br /><br />But, yeah, I've just left it alone for now, not releasing anything yet. I actually would like more to release it finished. The reason all this is on hold is simply that I'm busy with a real big project for work doing CG and if I do get some time free, I don't do even more CG stuff like modding Doom. Under normal circumstances I would have more time for myself and my own projects.<br /><br />I can't really say when I'll get back to this though. I really don't wanna just kill it, I do want to get it to a release point some time.<br /><br />About the Quake thing, it's in the same boat. Although the reason why I do the Quake stuff is for the monsters. I like to make them and that's about all. Joining the Quake mod team meant I was more obligated to give it preference in stead of doing other stuff, like the Wolf mod. That's the way I see it. But in the end, real work take top spot at this point in time. All my personal work are "on hold".. including the mod stuff...  unfortunately.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p193719" date="Posted: Fri Jan 11, 2008 8:27 am "><author>apegomp</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">While waiting for obihb-news, you might as well check out Voxelstein 3D:<br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080210192931im_/http://i225.photobucket.com/albums/dd202/highwingx3/VXL50000-7.png" alt="Image" /><br />I basically just modified the map in Ken Silverman's Voxlap test game (advsys.net/ken/voxlap.htm) in order to give a better impression of the engine's potential.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p193856" date="Posted: Mon Jan 14, 2008 9:34 pm "><author>der_ton</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">That looks cool.

Still need to get one some day.. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080210192936im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  I have a pretty good texture library of all various surfaces. So I use them and do manual editing on them as I need it.
<br /><br />But the key in Doom textures is the normal maps really. Without a good normal map it's not gonna help much either way. So it's much more modeling to go into a nice texture. I actually went through about 4 different tries to get the rock in my Wolf textures to look even half decent.
<br /><br />But I guess stuff like the concrete involves no modeling at all. It's normal map is made in Photoshop. so just photo of concrete and then create the other maps directly from that.
<br /><br />I have to admit though that I can't texture that well. This is why I like the Doom tech and I guess any future tech because it's more to my skill. I like to  think that I can model some and so creating the textures through modeling suits me a lot more than hand drawing stuff. I mean like in the old days of shading and stuff through hand drawn textures. Even then using photo sources makes it even easier because the shading is done through the normal map.
<br /><br />geX, I have seen Chai's mp40. Great looking model. I hope to get a good quality like that as well if I can.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p160422" date="Posted: Sun Oct 22, 2006 9:32 pm "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">obihb, understood and same here, I can paint textures by hand but I`m not a natural at them, and find it much easier to work with polys then pixels, unless I`m using photo editing filters and effects.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p160432" date="Posted: Mon Oct 23, 2006 1:31 am "><author>Kiltron</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Looking excellent dude! <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080210192936im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p160434" date="Posted: Mon Oct 23, 2006 2:04 am "><author>Enforcer</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">SUPERB LOOKS BLOODY BRILLIANT</div>]]></body></post><post id="p160445" date="Posted: Mon Oct 23, 2006 2:44 pm "><author>Sebultura</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Wow, it's amazing to see the great quality of your textures &amp; all (I'm no texture maker at all, but it look f**cking brilliant to me) !!!

<br /><br />Posting some shots of stuff I haven't really shown before.
<br /><br />Still not sure I'll keep the current version of the armor suit. It's based on real armor but dirty and rusty a bit compared to the super shiny real one. I'll still decide if I keep this one or make another. Just alot of work to make it. Maybe it just needs some work in the bump map, for dent or some stuff like that.

The gaps are mapped, not modelled.
<br /><br />The map on the table is actually a shading "problem". Not too sure I can do all that much about it short of modelling in more polys into the low poly model which I don't really wanna do. I'll see about that though, if it impacts it badly or not. It's a small enough problem to not loose sleep over.
<br /><br />This shot maybe demonstrate it a bit better.

<br /><br />I've a bunch of curiosity questions here:
<br /><br />- Are you gonna make faithful replicas of the original non-authentic (non-historical correct WW2) wolf3d weapons, or are you making authetic looking WW2 guns (and then a faithful Gatlin gun)? Similarly, are you gonna make Nazi enemies with historically accurate uniforms or replicate the classic Wolfenstein 3D looks?
<br /><br />- Do you have any sound files to replace existing D3 sounds? Or are you just keeping basic D3 sounds? Maybe this is too early to ask this question <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080210192941im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />- When this mod is done, are you considering using your assets to create a more sophisticated Wolfenstein mod with more advanced architecture, staircases etc.?
<br /><br />Either way, thanks for these gorgeous screenshots, they've put me in a great mood and I'm looking forward to trying it out <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080210192941im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p165018" date="Posted: Mon Dec 18, 2006 4:53 pm "><author>obihb</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks again for the positive replies here.
<br /><br />dsm, some answers for you.
<br /><br />About the weapons and characters. If I make them, I will probably have to look at some real world reference. The original graphics are so low res and low detail, to recreate them like that, with no other reference, will not be so cool I think. But basically what I've done so far is take the Wolf texture as a guide to create more realistic textures. Like make stone look like stone, etc. So that approuch to the guns and stuff could work, to base it on the old graphic and make it look more realistic. It just depends on what works.
<br /><br />The sound I wanna replace with recordings from the original Wolf3D. I've already got the first level music in there and door sounds and secret passage sound. I would like it to sound like old Wolf since it's so unique. Even though graphics then are updated, the sound is not. But I'll have to see how this works out though. Also one of the things I'll see when I get to it.
<br /><br />The mod thing, I'm not sure although I sortof doubt it. My intentions were to keep it simple since Wolf is so simple. Basically a remake of the first level with all new graphics. Wether I will take it any further I can't say right now. I never know what I will feel like doing, but as a first release it will only be the one map.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p165021" date="Posted: Mon Dec 18, 2006 5:21 pm "><author>bladeghost</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Wow obihb, looking great, it's a great feeling to have a project coming along to where its enjoyable to work on it.

Hope to see some weapon models anyway, since you seem to have the talent to create some good looking stuff (and looks is what matters in this regard).<br />Personally, I'd hate to model authentic guns myself (note: modelling them - don't mind authentic WW2 weapons in a game, since it's more believable that way), but that's because I love using my imagination and gathering inspiration for other imaginative weapon designs, but it's only great that there are others who don't have that kind of problem.<br /><br />Enemies would be great, but I understand your goal of keeping it simple and easy.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">The sound I wanna replace with recordings from the original Wolf3D.

Free sounds are usually of poor quality and it is difficult to find just the "right" kind of sounds; I've never succeeded in finding a good sound that "feels" even remotely like the classic Wolf3d "prison door" sound. Which is why I asked in the first place, because if you had happened to have access to some cool new sounds that would "fit", it'd be nice with a heads-up.<br /><br />I suppose it would be interesting to hear what it would be like with the old sounds, but I must admit that I would prefer fresh "new" sounds.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">The mod thing, I'm not sure although I sortof doubt it.

<br />Ok, fair enough and understood. What about the resources? If someone else asks you for permission to make a mod using some of your assets, would you share them? And no, I don't plan on making a Wolfenstein mod myself (at least not something like that for several years), merely asking out of curiosity, because I think you have done well and think your assets have potential.
<br /><br />Thanks for the answers (and the conversation).

I agree with you there, although this project for me is not a full on mod. It's more about making the assets and then making them available. I have fun creating them but I do think that creating a full mod is way more involved than what I'm doing.
<br /><br />dsm, maybe that also is an answer for your last question there. The stuff will be available for anyone to use when I release it. Even if people like to use bits and pieces I don't have a problem. As anyone would, I appreciate the credit if it is used. If you mean will I share at this stage before release?.

<br /><br />Ratty: The effect is a combo of rigid body for the wall break and of course particles for the dust. For the wall to break I have a force to push the pieces out. The particle system I had to make just for this since it's so spesific. It's cylindrical emitters to fit the exact space I need it for. Then the sound which is a combo of Doom sounds plus the final sliding sound from old Wolf. I think about 4 sounds in total.
<br /><br />mikebart: The codec is Divx. Should even work if you had Xvid installed aswell I think.
<br /><br />6th Venom: I'm not using relief, it's just all normal Doom3 stuff. So just normal maps. You will see the rock lose some depth at tight angles. To create the normal maps I use quite a steep long angle in the high poly geometry, so this helps to make it seem like the normal map has quite some depth to it.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p165281" date="Posted: Fri Dec 22, 2006 1:12 pm "><author>BJA</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Have to agree, that effect for the secret room is pretty cool!

<br />I am a member of doom reborn mod thats aiming to do a tc of doom1 and doom2 to doom3, thats why i am interested in this since i come from a similar project.
<br />I am very impressed with the results, having the old hud and some cool 3d npc's that resemble the old sprites would be perfect.
<br />They way you have done it until now is insanely cool,i love it! i also think the wall cracking animation efect is a touch of realism, just be sure not to make the levels too dark cuz allot of the old school feeling stays even in the smallest details like firing sounds and the banging of the doors behind you or treasure picking sounds.
<br /><br />A final question is why did you make the blue completely doors grey?
<br />I really think they shouldn't be so blue like in the old game but they should atleast have a tint of blue on them to show that you respect the original.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p168037" date="Posted: Mon Jan 22, 2007 9:20 am "><author>obihb</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Yeah, this is the only place I do any updates for this project.
<br /><br />Thanks for your positive feedback aswell.
<br /><br />About the doors. I made them gray because they seem to me like brushed metal and that usually has a more silvery gray look. What I did was add reflection that has some blue in it. I could surely add a very slight blue tint in the texture to see if it looks ok, but my intention is not nesessarily to match every color from the old game, merely the overall "look". Basically if you see it you'll see it's Wolf, right?.. regardless of some color differences here and there.
<br /><br />This counts for lighting aswell, especially since the old game had none. I think it's a oppertunity to give some sort of lighting that maybe doesn't even resemble the old game at all.

<br />Don't think the project is gonna die - obihb's just busy creating Quake creatures I think. That's what he was doing last time.
<br /><br />I think there was also something about Real Life getting on his back, reducing his productivity indefinitely.
<br />So progress, from what I understood, is gonna be damn slooooooow, but the mod probably ain't dying.

<br /><br />I've done some work on shaders, basically anything with reflection I've gone and updated the shaders to work much better. As I said the map is now complete as far as the structure goes. Almost all props are in there, I mean map decoration, not pickups. Maybe one or two props remain to make them.
<br /><br />So the work that is left mainly is the pickup models. Not weapons at this stage. There are also other stuff I want to do to just enhance things a bit. I will post more about that when I get to it and see if stuff will actually work the way I plan to make it.
<br /><br />So there is some life left in this project. And I wanted to mention again that this is not a Wolf3D mod for Doom3 in the sense of a "remake" of Wolf in Doom3. I've noticed on some web pages that people get a bit off track. This is merely an attempt to create the art assets. Making one map does not count as a "mod" as far as I am concerned.
<br /><br />If a mod is born from this initial work, then it'll be good for sure. But I just wanted to say this so there is no confusion about the project.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p172561" date="Posted: Fri Mar 09, 2007 11:49 am "><author>6th Venom</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I heard you will model 12 totally new enemies?  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080210192947im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" />  just jocking...

<br /><br />Imagine this bonestructure. (I'm not sure how far you can take bonebinding as I haven't experimented with it, but in any case this should work.)
<br /><br />Note: This is just a quick mockup. But something like these two examples should allow for a more realistic flag ragdoll, and make it move less rigid. In particular the left example, but I can't say how that one will fare in game.

If you look actually at the post Kritus made about the bone structure, it's something like the one on the right, just less bones. What I also do is link the bones on the bottom with spring constraint. This allows the flag to have a general movement even when only hit on one side. It also prevents the flag from pulling apart when just one of the bones move.
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Kristus</span>: You're spot on about the structure. This video is with my "prototype" and I probably will end up using more bones. I just had to make a test version with less bones because of testing both movement and to see if the spring would even work as I needed it to. As some may or may not know, it's damn tedious work to make AF. So I keep my tests simple.. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080210192947im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />I guess even with more bones it's still a test to see how things react and how the spring works to keep stuff together. So far it does a great job and it's pretty damn stable. In another test I have the potplant where I use springs to make the plant bounce back after you shoot it. It also works pretty well.
<br /><br />These things just take alot of testing because the AF stuff is so "full of sh..t". It's so easy to break it and then you get the breakdancing from hell.. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080210192947im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> So I tend to do endless tests on this stuff. And now I added the spring into it, which is new to me. So.. test.. and more test. I think slowly I get the hang of it though. I start to figure what to avoid.
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">ratty redemption</span>: I don't know about the glass stuff. I don't think I'll get into that stuff though. None of the props is gonna be able to be destroyed. It is the choice I made right in the beginning. I just don't intend to spend so much time on making things break. The one reason is that as soon as you realize one thing can break, you wanna break other things aswell.
<br /><br />The point being that not just one thing in the level should be able to break. It should all be able to break or damage. So, that's just the type of work I'm avoiding for this project. It's double the work to do that, maybe more.
<br /><br />Either way, I have no idea how to make the cloth rip. I mean, even if the shatter can be used, I doubt it would look good. I think it is something you've never seen because it's something that can't really be done with decent effect. Accept of course for that one demo I saw for that physics card. They had some real time cloth and shoot through it and it rips apart pretty realistically.
<br /><br />So, yeah, all I really intend to do at least is have objects "react" to getting shot but not get destroyed from it.

<br /><br />Using the springs to contain the movement works perfectly, even on multiple rows of bones.

<br />In my opinion, it's also far more satisfying to simply get objects to move by shooting at them. Destroying them just seems to me like a temporary pleasure that quickly dissipates.

<br /><br />About the 'destructability'- maybe you could break the mesh into many little parts and use skins to simulate a rip up.

<br /><br />EDIT2: Obihb: Is there any place where I can read up on what you've learn about the AFs in Doom3, so I can learn what you know about them?
<br /><br />EDIT3: You could make the cloth rip by changing the texture when it's hit, but it would probably look more stupid than cool. Of course if you make it have several stages of ripp, and you have it eject lots of particles while being hit, you could make it look atleast acceptable.
<br />But my experience with ripping cloth is that it's just a very unsatisfying result.

<br /><br />I also took what you said Kamikazee, about the squareness. It actually was a decision I made in the beginning to keep it square, although in Wolf all textures are square, it is actually squashed in the game to a rectangle. But what actually happened is that the rooms in my map ended up huge..  too huge really. So I also went back and made it the same there as in Wolf. Works out much better, the scale of the map is more accurate.
<br /><br />Don't have a crap load of new stuff in yet. I spent some time looking at physics objects. So for props, like the plant, tables, chairs, those things could be movable objects.
<br /><br />So just 2 new shots to show some small progress here. Got the level built up into the first big room. I basically build the level and make the models and textures as I need them, so got a few new things to make there.

<br /><br />Very true, what limited experience I have with 3d modeling constitutes for a very time consuming process.  I can't wait for this to come out, but I'd rather him take his time and do a good job.  Hopefully with the models and stuff others around here that know their way around the Doom 3 engine can make the rest of the 1st episodes levels.

The one thing I thought of doing is to release existing content and people can do with that what they want and if I get to finishing it the way I wanted, I release the final thing.<br /><br />The other thing is to hold off on releasing anything until I've completed what I set out to do.<br /><br />The real idea behind this really was to make the content rather than making a full mod. I guess I ended up making more stuff by going on to make the model for the guard as well, which never really was the plan, although I had it in the back of my head to maybe do it anyway.<br /><br />But, yeah, I've just left it alone for now, not releasing anything yet. I actually would like more to release it finished. The reason all this is on hold is simply that I'm busy with a real big project for work doing CG and if I do get some time free, I don't do even more CG stuff like modding Doom. Under normal circumstances I would have more time for myself and my own projects.<br /><br />I can't really say when I'll get back to this though. I really don't wanna just kill it, I do want to get it to a release point some time.<br /><br />About the Quake thing, it's in the same boat. Although the reason why I do the Quake stuff is for the monsters. I like to make them and that's about all. Joining the Quake mod team meant I was more obligated to give it preference in stead of doing other stuff, like the Wolf mod. That's the way I see it. But in the end, real work take top spot at this point in time. All my personal work are "on hold".. including the mod stuff...  unfortunately.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p193719" date="Posted: Fri Jan 11, 2008 8:27 am "><author>apegomp</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">While waiting for obihb-news, you might as well check out Voxelstein 3D:<br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080210192931im_/http://i225.photobucket.com/albums/dd202/highwingx3/VXL50000-7.png" alt="Image" /><br />I basically just modified the map in Ken Silverman's Voxlap test game (advsys.net/ken/voxlap.htm) in order to give a better impression of the engine's potential.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p193856" date="Posted: Mon Jan 14, 2008 9:34 pm "><author>der_ton</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">That looks cool.

<br /><br />I also took what you said Kamikazee, about the squareness. It actually was a decision I made in the beginning to keep it square, although in Wolf all textures are square, it is actually squashed in the game to a rectangle. But what actually happened is that the rooms in my map ended up huge..  too huge really. So I also went back and made it the same there as in Wolf. Works out much better, the scale of the map is more accurate.
<br /><br />Don't have a crap load of new stuff in yet. I spent some time looking at physics objects. So for props, like the plant, tables, chairs, those things could be movable objects.
<br /><br />So just 2 new shots to show some small progress here. Got the level built up into the first big room. I basically build the level and make the models and textures as I need them, so got a few new things to make there.

<br /><br />I also took what you said Kamikazee, about the squareness. It actually was a decision I made in the beginning to keep it square, although in Wolf all textures are square, it is actually squashed in the game to a rectangle. But what actually happened is that the rooms in my map ended up huge..  too huge really. So I also went back and made it the same there as in Wolf. Works out much better, the scale of the map is more accurate.
<br /><br />Don't have a crap load of new stuff in yet. I spent some time looking at physics objects. So for props, like the plant, tables, chairs, those things could be movable objects.
<br /><br />So just 2 new shots to show some small progress here. Got the level built up into the first big room. I basically build the level and make the models and textures as I need them, so got a few new things to make there.

<br /><br />I also took what you said Kamikazee, about the squareness. It actually was a decision I made in the beginning to keep it square, although in Wolf all textures are square, it is actually squashed in the game to a rectangle. But what actually happened is that the rooms in my map ended up huge..  too huge really. So I also went back and made it the same there as in Wolf. Works out much better, the scale of the map is more accurate.
<br /><br />Don't have a crap load of new stuff in yet. I spent some time looking at physics objects. So for props, like the plant, tables, chairs, those things could be movable objects.
<br /><br />So just 2 new shots to show some small progress here. Got the level built up into the first big room. I basically build the level and make the models and textures as I need them, so got a few new things to make there.

<br /><br />Here's 2 shots just to show what I've got going so far. It's the first section of the first level.

<br /><br />I also took what you said Kamikazee, about the squareness. It actually was a decision I made in the beginning to keep it square, although in Wolf all textures are square, it is actually squashed in the game to a rectangle. But what actually happened is that the rooms in my map ended up huge..  too huge really. So I also went back and made it the same there as in Wolf. Works out much better, the scale of the map is more accurate.
<br /><br />Don't have a crap load of new stuff in yet. I spent some time looking at physics objects. So for props, like the plant, tables, chairs, those things could be movable objects.
<br /><br />So just 2 new shots to show some small progress here. Got the level built up into the first big room. I basically build the level and make the models and textures as I need them, so got a few new things to make there.

<br /><br />I also took what you said Kamikazee, about the squareness. It actually was a decision I made in the beginning to keep it square, although in Wolf all textures are square, it is actually squashed in the game to a rectangle. But what actually happened is that the rooms in my map ended up huge..  too huge really. So I also went back and made it the same there as in Wolf. Works out much better, the scale of the map is more accurate.
<br /><br />Don't have a crap load of new stuff in yet. I spent some time looking at physics objects. So for props, like the plant, tables, chairs, those things could be movable objects.
<br /><br />So just 2 new shots to show some small progress here. Got the level built up into the first big room. I basically build the level and make the models and textures as I need them, so got a few new things to make there.

<br /><br />I also took what you said Kamikazee, about the squareness. It actually was a decision I made in the beginning to keep it square, although in Wolf all textures are square, it is actually squashed in the game to a rectangle. But what actually happened is that the rooms in my map ended up huge..  too huge really. So I also went back and made it the same there as in Wolf. Works out much better, the scale of the map is more accurate.
<br /><br />Don't have a crap load of new stuff in yet. I spent some time looking at physics objects. So for props, like the plant, tables, chairs, those things could be movable objects.
<br /><br />So just 2 new shots to show some small progress here. Got the level built up into the first big room. I basically build the level and make the models and textures as I need them, so got a few new things to make there.

It actually was a decision I made in the beginning to keep it square, although in Wolf all textures are square, it is actually squashed in the game to a rectangle. But what actually happened is that the rooms in my map ended up huge..  too huge really. So I also went back and made it the same there as in Wolf. Works out much better, the scale of the map is more accurate.&#13;<br /><br />Don't have a crap load of new stuff in yet. I spent some time looking at physics objects. So for props, like the plant, tables, chairs, those things could be movable objects.&#13;<br /><br />So just 2 new shots to show some small progress here. Got the level built up into the first big room. I basically build the level and make the models and textures as I need them, so got a few new things to make there.&#13;<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img100.imageshack.us/my.php?image=shot00003up0.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img100.imageshack.us/img100/1107/shot00003up0.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img95.imageshack.us/my.php?image=image00002nk6.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img95.imageshack.us/img95/697/image00002nk6.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a></div>]]></body></post><post id="p160299" date="Posted: Sat Oct 21, 2006 10:02 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I like your door frames there obhib, could you post a wire frame image of them?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p190789" date="Posted: Sun Oct 28, 2007 7:57 am "><author>obihb</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">OOW!!..<br /><br />Where am I??..<br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /><br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p190789" date="Posted: Sun Oct 28, 2007 7:57 am "><author>obihb</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">OOW!!..<br /><br />Where am I??..<br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /><br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p191532" date="Posted: Thu Nov 15, 2007 7:39 pm "><author>dsm</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">obihb wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"> I'm too busy now in my "real" work and it won't change for 5 or 6 months for sure and then I can't predict it after that.<br /></div><br />Well, I'm essentially willing to wait a decade or more if I have to (waited 11 years for Doom 3 itself, didn't I?

The one thing I thought of doing is to release existing content and people can do with that what they want and if I get to finishing it the way I wanted, I release the final thing.<br /><br />The other thing is to hold off on releasing anything until I've completed what I set out to do.<br /><br />The real idea behind this really was to make the content rather than making a full mod. I guess I ended up making more stuff by going on to make the model for the guard as well, which never really was the plan, although I had it in the back of my head to maybe do it anyway.<br /><br />But, yeah, I've just left it alone for now, not releasing anything yet. I actually would like more to release it finished. The reason all this is on hold is simply that I'm busy with a real big project for work doing CG and if I do get some time free, I don't do even more CG stuff like modding Doom. Under normal circumstances I would have more time for myself and my own projects.<br /><br />I can't really say when I'll get back to this though. I really don't wanna just kill it, I do want to get it to a release point some time.<br /><br />About the Quake thing, it's in the same boat. Although the reason why I do the Quake stuff is for the monsters. I like to make them and that's about all. Joining the Quake mod team meant I was more obligated to give it preference in stead of doing other stuff, like the Wolf mod. That's the way I see it. But in the end, real work take top spot at this point in time. All my personal work are "on hold".. including the mod stuff...  unfortunately.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p193719" date="Posted: Fri Jan 11, 2008 8:27 am "><author>apegomp</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">While waiting for obihb-news, you might as well check out Voxelstein 3D:<br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://i225.photobucket.com/albums/dd202/highwingx3/VXL50000-7.png" alt="Image" /><br />I basically just modified the map in Ken Silverman's Voxlap test game (advsys.net/ken/voxlap.htm) in order to give a better impression of the engine's potential.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p193856" date="Posted: Mon Jan 14, 2008 9:34 pm "><author>der_ton</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">That looks cool.

Under normal circumstances I would have more time for myself and my own projects.<br /><br />I can't really say when I'll get back to this though. I really don't wanna just kill it, I do want to get it to a release point some time.<br /><br />About the Quake thing, it's in the same boat. Although the reason why I do the Quake stuff is for the monsters. I like to make them and that's about all. Joining the Quake mod team meant I was more obligated to give it preference in stead of doing other stuff, like the Wolf mod. That's the way I see it. But in the end, real work take top spot at this point in time. All my personal work are "on hold".. including the mod stuff...  unfortunately.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p193719" date="Posted: Fri Jan 11, 2008 8:27 am "><author>apegomp</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">While waiting for obihb-news, you might as well check out Voxelstein 3D:<br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://i225.photobucket.com/albums/dd202/highwingx3/VXL50000-7.png" alt="Image" /><br />I basically just modified the map in Ken Silverman's Voxlap test game (advsys.net/ken/voxlap.htm) in order to give a better impression of the engine's potential.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p193856" date="Posted: Mon Jan 14, 2008 9:34 pm "><author>der_ton</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">That looks cool.

The one thing I thought of doing is to release existing content and people can do with that what they want and if I get to finishing it the way I wanted, I release the final thing.<br /><br />The other thing is to hold off on releasing anything until I've completed what I set out to do.<br /><br />The real idea behind this really was to make the content rather than making a full mod. I guess I ended up making more stuff by going on to make the model for the guard as well, which never really was the plan, although I had it in the back of my head to maybe do it anyway.<br /><br />But, yeah, I've just left it alone for now, not releasing anything yet. I actually would like more to release it finished. The reason all this is on hold is simply that I'm busy with a real big project for work doing CG and if I do get some time free, I don't do even more CG stuff like modding Doom.
