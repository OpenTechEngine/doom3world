Yes, Serengrove is quite greedy for a Doom 3 map, so my apologies to anyone with a modest machine. I developed the map on an Inspiron 1520 with a 2.2ghz Duo CPU, 256mb DDR2 GeForce 8600m GT, and 3gb DDR2 RAM. It runs ok on it but not superb - around 20-30fps (15 at its worst). It is hard to be resourceful when making a big open map though, especially when you want to go all out in almost every facet of it. Many of the visportals in the map are constantly open, due to so much of the map being visible from many different areas (technically you could look out of the window in one building and into the window of another in a different district). I would like to go back some time and correct a few things after I've had a break from it, and the fps will definately be something for me to look at.<br /><br />Edit: If anyone has any suggestions that could dramatically increase the framerate without taking too much from the visuals - I'm all ears <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081118182706im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p192171" date="Posted: Mon Dec 03, 2007 8:27 am "><author>Dinky</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I love the map, very well done. I have a pretty beefy machine and the map runs overall, pretty smooth, but it does have some significant and moderate framerate drops in a few places, which I assumed it would, but even some places like corridors with no windows had framerate drops (like the first hallway you enter, with the mirror). I just assumed it was because of visportals, and the fact that the map is so broad. Still, very well done and I love the map, pretty creepy too <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081118182706im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081118182706im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p192202" date="Posted: Tue Dec 04, 2007 2:20 am "><author>Spyguy12</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Awesome map, The Inn had me jumping many times, good detail , was pretty fun <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081118182706im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p192204" date="Posted: Tue Dec 04, 2007 6:38 am "><author>CrimsonHead</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Horror wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">If anyone has any suggestions that could dramatically increase the framerate without taking too much from the visuals - I'm all ears <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081118182706im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /></div><br /><br />Don't get angry at me if you already know or have tried any of my suggestions, I'm just trying to be helpful by listing whatever I can think of that might help with the performance.<br /><br />Play around with the VisPortals, sometimes if they are'nt used correctly or in the right place they can give horrible performance, try them in different places to see where you get the best framerate.  In the large open areas if you have any giant brushes try splitting them up into groups of smaller brushes so you don't have as many lights hitting the same surface. Play around with the lighting, try not to have too many overlapping lights, especially really big ones with a lot of smaller ones inside their volume. I know it looks like crap with smaller lights in bigger rooms because you get those pitch black areas, but if you use parallel lighting for outdoors you tend to get better results and it looks softer and fills up those darkened corners. I don;t know if you've seen this before but I found some really helpful lighting tips here: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081118182706/http://www.katsbits.com/htm/tutorials.htm#doom_3_tutorials">http://www.katsbits.com/htm/tutorials.h ... _tutorials</a><!-- m --><br />Also, you could try decreasing the resolution on some of your custom textures, not so much where they look like crap, but I'm sure you can find a middle ground where they still look decent and are'nt hard on the video memory. Make sure you have'nt missed any caulking anywhere. that's just about all I can think of there, I hope it helps. <br /><br />Aside from the map not running well on my machine I really liked it though, it looks good, the ambience and mood of it really kicks ass. I liked the talking deer heads that was creepy and cool at the same time, it reminded me of the Evil Dead II. I'm keeping it on my HD, Hopefully someday when I get a better machine... or hopefully some of the suggestions I gave or somebody else can help you get it optimised further, whichever happens first. Either way it's an excellent contribution, and even though it was slightly laggy on my rig I still had a hell of a lot of fun with it, thank you! <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081118182706im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p192209" date="Posted: Tue Dec 04, 2007 12:54 pm "><author>Horror</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">You've raised some good points there CrimsonHead and that lighting tutorial is actually quite a good read too.

Yes, Serengrove is quite greedy for a Doom 3 map, so my apologies to anyone with a modest machine. I developed the map on an Inspiron 1520 with a 2.2ghz Duo CPU, 256mb DDR2 GeForce 8600m GT, and 3gb DDR2 RAM. It runs ok on it but not superb - around 20-30fps (15 at its worst). It is hard to be resourceful when making a big open map though, especially when you want to go all out in almost every facet of it. Many of the visportals in the map are constantly open, due to so much of the map being visible from many different areas (technically you could look out of the window in one building and into the window of another in a different district). I would like to go back some time and correct a few things after I've had a break from it, and the fps will definately be something for me to look at.<br /><br />Edit: If anyone has any suggestions that could dramatically increase the framerate without taking too much from the visuals - I'm all ears <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081118183722im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p192171" date="Posted: Mon Dec 03, 2007 8:27 am "><author>Dinky</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I love the map, very well done. I have a pretty beefy machine and the map runs overall, pretty smooth, but it does have some significant and moderate framerate drops in a few places, which I assumed it would, but even some places like corridors with no windows had framerate drops (like the first hallway you enter, with the mirror). I just assumed it was because of visportals, and the fact that the map is so broad. Still, very well done and I love the map, pretty creepy too <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081118183722im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081118183722im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p192202" date="Posted: Tue Dec 04, 2007 2:20 am "><author>Spyguy12</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Awesome map, The Inn had me jumping many times, good detail , was pretty fun <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081118183722im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p192204" date="Posted: Tue Dec 04, 2007 6:38 am "><author>CrimsonHead</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Horror wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">If anyone has any suggestions that could dramatically increase the framerate without taking too much from the visuals - I'm all ears <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081118183722im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /></div><br /><br />Don't get angry at me if you already know or have tried any of my suggestions, I'm just trying to be helpful by listing whatever I can think of that might help with the performance.<br /><br />Play around with the VisPortals, sometimes if they are'nt used correctly or in the right place they can give horrible performance, try them in different places to see where you get the best framerate.  In the large open areas if you have any giant brushes try splitting them up into groups of smaller brushes so you don't have as many lights hitting the same surface. Play around with the lighting, try not to have too many overlapping lights, especially really big ones with a lot of smaller ones inside their volume. I know it looks like crap with smaller lights in bigger rooms because you get those pitch black areas, but if you use parallel lighting for outdoors you tend to get better results and it looks softer and fills up those darkened corners. I don;t know if you've seen this before but I found some really helpful lighting tips here: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081118183722/http://www.katsbits.com/htm/tutorials.htm#doom_3_tutorials">http://www.katsbits.com/htm/tutorials.h ... _tutorials</a><!-- m --><br />Also, you could try decreasing the resolution on some of your custom textures, not so much where they look like crap, but I'm sure you can find a middle ground where they still look decent and are'nt hard on the video memory. Make sure you have'nt missed any caulking anywhere. that's just about all I can think of there, I hope it helps. <br /><br />Aside from the map not running well on my machine I really liked it though, it looks good, the ambience and mood of it really kicks ass. I liked the talking deer heads that was creepy and cool at the same time, it reminded me of the Evil Dead II. I'm keeping it on my HD, Hopefully someday when I get a better machine... or hopefully some of the suggestions I gave or somebody else can help you get it optimised further, whichever happens first.

I appreciate the feedback.<br /><br />I've sent an email off to d3files too, so hopefully they get it up in a few days.

I need to get me a new graphics driver when I can get bothered, but rest assured, this map I'm keeping for later play - it must've been the first time I've been shocked and scared as much as this. Thanks for making it.
