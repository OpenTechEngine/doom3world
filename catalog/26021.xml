Once done that you can then merge and pick up different faces by pressing ctrl+shift + left click. Then press the mouse wheel while hovering with your cursor the brush with the texture you want to assign to the other brush. That will automatically copy the texture present in the brush you were hovering when you clicked mousewheel to the brushes/faces you have selected.<br />That or you can simply pick up the texture from the list and then make it fit and what not..</div>]]></body></post><post id="p244220" date="Posted: Wed Nov 14, 2012 11:27 pm "><author>aphexjh</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">So I think I see your problem. <br /><br />Here's your start point:<br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320010156/http://imgur.com/EbDxG" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320010156im_/http://i.imgur.com/EbDxG.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br /><br />and you want to merge brush A and brush B, but the issue is that the editor just assumes the qualities of brush A should overwrite those of brush B, making the first texture of brush A replace all others. <br /><br />like so:<br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320010156/http://imgur.com/pQa9V" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320010156im_/http://i.imgur.com/pQa9V.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br /><br />The problem is that "merging" is not working the way I think you are hoping.  I think you want the brushes to become one,(like the "combine" command in Maya or other 3d software) but still have there respective parts.<br />Like So:<br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320010156/http://imgur.com/JXX5K" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320010156im_/http://i.imgur.com/JXX5K.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br /><br />The reality is that "merging" the brushes may be of limited use, since you may still want the adjacent faces to have different textures applied to them, which is not possible if the faces exist on the same plane, because they will be unified as you have seen and not retain the individual texture.  The Solution is to use groups.  They allow you to move and edit the brushes together, but they are still able to retain their respective attributes. <br /><br />I think you do this by:<br />1. shift+LMB select both brushes. <br />2. ctrl+g to group the brushes<br />3. that's it, modify textures as need be<br /><br />hope this helps.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p244222" date="Posted: Thu Nov 15, 2012 3:20 am "><author>Douglas Quaid</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I'm always mirroring textures to make one texture but if a true merge option was available it would really make a big difference on my brush count.

The only advantage I can see for you to merge them is to make selecting groups of brushes easier.

They can be copied just like any other brush and you can also modify the individual brushes that make up the group.  To do this, select the group, then press 'tab' to cycle through the brushes in the group.  CTRL+SHIFT clicking on a face will still allow you to modify the materials just like any other brush.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p244202" date="Posted: Tue Nov 13, 2012 10:50 pm "><author>doom1234</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I can't really find an answer for this, so I'll just ask, How do I merge two different walls together?
