<br /><br />If you look at the list of console commands (i.e. listcmds) there are a couple of save commands. The one that sticks out in this case is saveragdolls.
<br /><br />Turns out you can position the ragdolls using the cvar Qwertys listed above and then save them that way. Sweet.
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">NOTE:</span> Make sure you are actually spawning ragdolls and not just monsters that you've beaten to death. It only saves entities that were spawned as ragdolls.
<br /><br />Ragdolls start with the prefix env_ragdoll.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p30457" date="Posted: Sun Aug 08, 2004 5:06 am "><author>rich_is_bored</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I can't stop finding goodies. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100522163730im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Two more commands that will help you pose dead bodies in your maps...
<br /><br />bindragdoll
<br />unbindragdoll
<br /><br />These both work in conjunction with the cvar g_dragentity posted above and it's best if you bind these commands to keys. I suggest j and k to go along with h.
<br /><br />You'd toggle g_dragentity mode. Then select the limb of the ragdoll and move it to where you want it to be. Then while holding it there you can bind it in place. If you screw up you just drag the ragdoll and unbind it.
<br /><br />It's funny. I wish I knew about this a few hours ago when I posed those zombies for the screen above.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p30473" date="Posted: Sun Aug 08, 2004 6:14 am "><author>BoufCatt</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">hahah now this stuff is gold  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100522163730im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8)" title="Cool" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p30474" date="Posted: Sun Aug 08, 2004 6:14 am "><author>korn</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">very nice finds! awesome</div>]]></body></post><post id="p30485" date="Posted: Sun Aug 08, 2004 6:55 am "><author>sic1</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Wow, I've been playing with that way too much.

<br /><br />Here's a stupid question probably .. well I have bound these commands to my cfg. 
<br /><br />"K" I want to bindragdoll, will I just do the following:
<br /><br />bind "K" "toggle bindragdoll"
<br /><br />it doesn't seem to bind their joints in the position I want them in.  I'm trying to get a ragdoll in the sitting position in the corner of a room. 
<br /><br />Is there a prefix to "bindragdoll" such as "g_bindragdoll",  I looked over the cvar list and can't find those commands.
<br /><br />Any help would be greatly appreciated.
<br /><br />-Jason</div>]]></body></post></posts></thread></xml>
