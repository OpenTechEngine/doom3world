I had a lot of fun playing it so far, I can't wait for the rest. I've been seriously starving for some more Q4 SP maps.<br /><br />It looks very professional and has a nice Q2 feel to it, the lighting is just right not too dark, not too bright. I agree it is a little difficult, I was down to 10 hp at a couple points, that's cool though I'd rather have a challenge than something I could blow through in under 5 mins.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p201857" date="Posted: Sun Jul 13, 2008 7:10 pm "><author>phantazm11</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks a lot guys. <br /><br />I'm still chugging away at this, though the time I have to work on it is in short supply these days. I'm about half way finished with the second map (it will be considerably longer than the first "prelude" map). I plan on revising the first map also to include some feedback received on this and other sites, and will roll the first revised map and the second together to be released into beta 2 status.<br /><br />Phantazm11</div>]]></body></post></posts></thread></xml>
