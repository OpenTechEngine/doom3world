Here's the second texture challlenge, I don't want to throw any mud especially this early in a challenge, but. I think Phooka may have rigged last moths voting, you had better post some images Phook's j/k, no pressure <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20060313201352im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0"/>. The voting for next months challenge has been moved here as it's better that way.&#13;

<br/><br/>
1. It's very dark - not sure whether it's my monitor, but it's very hard to make out detail on the ingame shots.&#13;
<br/><br/>
2. The angular 'cracks' are going to tile very repetitively on large sections of wall - it will result in obvious repetition. You can either make the wall 3 times longer, or have different segments of wall, with one standard segment that can tile without obvious repeating.&#13;
<br/><br/>
lovecrafty, it's hard to make out the local map detail on those textures from the screenshots - looks very flat, but that could be just the example geometry the texture is applied to.</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

The TGA textures are 512x512 giving leeway to use for a large block stone wall right down to small cobble stone floor.&#13;
<br/><br/>
First, the result of the texture :-&#13;
<br/><br/><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20060313201352im_/http://www.3r.co.za/bushboy/d3w-tc2/bb_cobble/bb_cobble_method5.jpg" border="0"/><br/><br/>
I've worked with a few local maps and this is the best so far - it's incredible how much you can change a texture with them.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Here's the links to the base photos  used (first link is the stones, second I used for the grout)&#13;
<br/><br/><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060313201352/http://www.sxc.hu/browse.phtml?f=view&amp;id=1723" target="_blank">http://www.sxc.hu/browse.phtml?f=view&amp;id=1723</a>&#13;

<br/><br/>
If you look at the first link of the cobble stones, I first free transformed it in photoshop like so :-&#13;
<br/><br/><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20060313201352im_/http://www.3r.co.za/bushboy/d3w-tc2/bb_cobble/bb_cobble_method1.jpg" border="0"/><br/><br/>
Basically, you go into free transform mode, hold down the control key and drag the handles with the left mouse button to distort the shape. This is very useful if you want to get an angled photo looking more flat, as is the case here.&#13;
<br/><br/>
I then started a new 512x512 canvas and cut out various rocks from the above transformed photo, laying them onto the canvas and shifting them as I went, getting a perfectly tiled texture like so :-&#13;
<br/><br/><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20060313201352im_/http://www.3r.co.za/bushboy/d3w-tc2/bb_cobble/bb_cobble_method3.jpg" border="0"/><br/><br/>
These were all flattened into one layer that I could easily mask off with the CTRL key, which would just select the stones. I took out obvious dark details like shadows with the clone brush.&#13;
<br/><br/>
For the grount, I took the image from the second link above, took a 512x512 section out of it, did an offset filter, fixed the seams and pasted it under my rocks to get the diffuse :-&#13;
<br/><br/><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20060313201352im_/http://www.3r.co.za/bushboy/d3w-tc2/bb_cobble/bb_cobble_method8.jpg" border="0"/><br/><br/>
I then duplicated the rocks layer, whapped it onto a black background, desaturated the duplicate layer, changed the brightness a bit and ran the nvidia local map filter to get :-&#13;
<br/><br/><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20060313201352im_/http://www.3r.co.za/bushboy/d3w-tc2/bb_cobble/bb_cobble_method2.jpg" border="0"/><br/><br/>
The specular I used a similar method then just adjusted contrast/brightness to get &#13;
<br/><br/><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20060313201352im_/http://www.3r.co.za/bushboy/d3w-tc2/bb_cobble/bb_cobble_method4.jpg" border="0"/><br/><br/>
Took about 2 hours.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Here's the same with a different local :-&#13;

I can host the files and they could be liked to the D3W assets section on the main page, if people are willing to submit files, we would need to set up some guildlines for that I suppose, for example, for limiting file sizes and such, maybe we should limit the download to 256x256 size textures also along with using jpegs where possible.</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

For the brick wall normal I did 2 normal maps and merged them.  Seems âoverlayâ can work sometimes, but I cut them to fit together this time.  1 map for the bricks, from a black and white grid, and another for the surface detail.  For the latter I painted broken bits onto the diffuse in grayscale and adjusted the normal filter.  In the end, I went too deep on the bricks normal mapâ¦&#13;

<br/><br/>
Iâve cropped the sidewalk diffuse, and left out the specular, as it cant be perceived by human eyes anyway <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20060313201352im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0"/>  All the parallel lines kept creating that messed up banding effect, but finally I got it acceptable after toning down the specular and corrupting the effect by dirtying the diffuse and normal, (thereby reducing the occurrence of stacked parallel lines and reducing the banding effect).  Any smaller size kills this textures detail, unfortunatelyâ¦ &#13;

<br/><br/>
I used Filter/artistic/poster_edges to generate the gravel specular and 1 of its 2 normal maps.  The other normal was made from a modified diffuse.  Both were combined for final effect. Burned in shadows and highlights from the photo-source was a problem, remedied by dodge and burning to even it outâ¦&#13;

The heightmap is a combination of the terragen method as explained by Black Dog in this forum and some black airbrush. The diffuse is combination of two composite photo samples that have been manipulated to take away the harsh high/low lighting, along with the black airbrush and the mortar rasta using some blending options. the spec is a combination of the normal that has been desaturated and transparency added, along with levels and some select/modify/expand applied. The decal to the right is decals/sdirt11&#13;
