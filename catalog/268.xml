<br/>
I know the toppic of decals has been covered a 1,000 times but the fact is there is so many different ways to make functional decals and I doubt I know them all or I would write a comprehensive one on it&#13;
<br/>
The fact is Im jjust now finnaly getting my feet wet with modeling and texture3s so Im probably the last person that should attempt such and effort&#13;

i have been using terragen to good result, and i am looking into using photos, to do a panorama, and make a sky box from that etc.&#13;
<br/>
what i would like to know is, what technique was used to create the sky boxes for farcry? there sky boxes are great. the clouds have a nice fluffy look, and apear more "real" than anything i have seen so far.&#13;
<br/><br/>
also, apart from the above two techniques, are there any other techniques used to make sky boxes?</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

Looking forward to any and all tutorials, especially those related to the creation of textures for both the environments and models. Of course, if I knew what I were doing, I'd be glad to create some tutorials for the Doom community, however, I'm still a little shady (pardon the pun) on a few points. Once I know the requirements of the engine, I'm sure I'll be able to begin putting something together for us.

I'd suggest you walk yourself through the assload of tutorials in the scripting section before you complain about the absence of tutorials, let alone the list of tutorials in the level editing section.&#13;
<br/><br/>
When you're done, if 4 weeks or so, we'll have enough new tutorials to keep you busy till Christmas.&#13;

That was not meant as complaint or anything else, and it certainly wasn't anything personal BNA. There is more info here on doom3 then any other site.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Sometimes I forget to say thanks, so thanks to everyone for their hard work on the tutorials, having written one, I know how long it takes to do it right.&#13;

One of the problems with converting quake textures to doom is that in q3 the highlights were drawn into the texture, in doom the ingame texture is made up of diffusemaps, normalmaps &amp; specular that control the RGB, shadow &amp; highlight of the texture ingame. &#13;
<br/><br/>
I'm sure at some stage there will be more texture sets to choose from, but at this stage in the game all mappers can do is wait for the texture folks to get some custom D3 sets out there, if your up for attempting to remake the textures check out the stickies in this forum, there's a whole load of decent info on texture creation to be found here.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="/web/20061013024611/http://www.doom3world.org/" target="_blank" class="postlink"><img src="/web/20061013024611im_/http://www.doom3world.org/site/img/d3w.gif" border="0"/> Staff</a></span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

One of the problems with converting quake textures to doom is that in q3 the highlights were drawn into the texture, in doom the ingame texture is made up of diffusemaps, normalmaps &amp; specular that control the RGB, shadow &amp; highlight of the texture ingame. &#13;
<br/><br/>
I'm sure at some stage there will be more texture sets to choose from, but at this stage in the game all mappers can do is wait for the texture folks to get some custom D3 sets out there, if your up for attempting to remake the textures check out the stickies in this forum, there's a whole load of decent info on texture creation to be found here.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="/web/20061013022414/http://www.doom3world.org/" target="_blank" class="postlink"><img src="/web/20061013022414im_/http://www.doom3world.org/site/img/d3w.gif" border="0"/> Staff</a></span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

I know the toppic of decals has been covered a 1,000 times but the fact is there is so many different ways to make functional decals and I doubt I know them all or I would write a comprehensive one on it&#13;

The fact is Im jjust now finnaly getting my feet wet with modeling and texture3s so Im probably the last person that should attempt such and effort&#13;

<br />Looking forward to any and all tutorials, especially those related to the creation of textures for both the environments and models.

<br />Looking forward to any and all tutorials, especially those related to the creation of textures for both the environments and models.

<br /><br />I'd suggest you walk yourself through the assload of tutorials in the scripting section before you complain about the absence of tutorials, let alone the list of tutorials in the level editing section.
<br /><br />When you're done, if 4 weeks or so, we'll have enough new tutorials to keep you busy till Christmas.

<br /><br />One of the problems with converting quake textures to doom is that in q3 the highlights were drawn into the texture, in doom the ingame texture is made up of diffusemaps, normalmaps &amp; specular that control the RGB, shadow &amp; highlight of the texture ingame. 
<br /><br />I'm sure at some stage there will be more texture sets to choose from, but at this stage in the game all mappers can do is wait for the texture folks to get some custom D3 sets out there, if your up for attempting to remake the textures check out the stickies in this forum, there's a whole load of decent info on texture creation to be found here.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p54200" date="Posted: Thu Sep 30, 2004 2:40 am "><author>QuiXilver</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">ok figured out your tut on projected lights II

<br /><br />One of the problems with converting quake textures to doom is that in q3 the highlights were drawn into the texture, in doom the ingame texture is made up of diffusemaps, normalmaps &amp; specular that control the RGB, shadow &amp; highlight of the texture ingame. 
<br /><br />I'm sure at some stage there will be more texture sets to choose from, but at this stage in the game all mappers can do is wait for the texture folks to get some custom D3 sets out there, if your up for attempting to remake the textures check out the stickies in this forum, there's a whole load of decent info on texture creation to be found here.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p54200" date="Posted: Thu Sep 30, 2004 1:40 am "><author>QuiXilver</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">ok figured out your tut on projected lights II

<br /><br />btw if I'm really stoopid and its already been done sorry but could you point me in the right direction</div>]]></body></post><post id="p48519" date="Posted: Thu Sep 09, 2004 6:55 pm "><author>eskimo roll</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">I-c-e wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Hey ppl<br /><br />I'm currently trying to convert one of my Q3 levels to Doom3 but I'm having problems trying to find the appropriate textures in Doom3 as the style of my level was the Q3 Gothic style and Doom3 doesn't have many textures like this the closest I've found are the hell textures. so what I want to do is convert some Q3 textures to Doom 3 but I'm struggling<br /><br />so can somebody do a Q3 to D3 texture tut<br /><br />btw if I'm really stoopid and its already been done sorry but could you point me in the right direction</div>
<br /><br />One of the problems with converting quake textures to doom is that in q3 the highlights were drawn into the texture, in doom the ingame texture is made up of diffusemaps, normalmaps &amp; specular that control the RGB, shadow &amp; highlight of the texture ingame. 
<br /><br />I'm sure at some stage there will be more texture sets to choose from, but at this stage in the game all mappers can do is wait for the texture folks to get some custom D3 sets out there, if your up for attempting to remake the textures check out the stickies in this forum, there's a whole load of decent info on texture creation to be found here.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p54200" date="Posted: Thu Sep 30, 2004 2:40 am "><author>QuiXilver</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">ok figured out your tut on projected lights II

<br /><br />I'm sure at some stage there will be more texture sets to choose from, but at this stage in the game all mappers can do is wait for the texture folks to get some custom D3 sets out there, if your up for attempting to remake the textures check out the stickies in this forum, there's a whole load of decent info on texture creation to be found here.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p54200" date="Posted: Thu Sep 30, 2004 1:40 am "><author>QuiXilver</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">ok figured out your tut on projected lights II

<br /><br />I'm sure at some stage there will be more texture sets to choose from, but at this stage in the game all mappers can do is wait for the texture folks to get some custom D3 sets out there, if your up for attempting to remake the textures check out the stickies in this forum, there's a whole load of decent info on texture creation to be found here.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p54200" date="Posted: Thu Sep 30, 2004 1:40 am "><author>QuiXilver</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">ok figured out your tut on projected lights II

<br /><br />I'd suggest you walk yourself through the assload of tutorials in the scripting section before you complain about the absence of tutorials, let alone the list of tutorials in the level editing section.
<br /><br />When you're done, if 4 weeks or so, we'll have enough new tutorials to keep you busy till Christmas.

<br /><br />One of the problems with converting quake textures to doom is that in q3 the highlights were drawn into the texture, in doom the ingame texture is made up of diffusemaps, normalmaps &amp; specular that control the RGB, shadow &amp; highlight of the texture ingame. 
<br /><br />I'm sure at some stage there will be more texture sets to choose from, but at this stage in the game all mappers can do is wait for the texture folks to get some custom D3 sets out there, if your up for attempting to remake the textures check out the stickies in this forum, there's a whole load of decent info on texture creation to be found here.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p54200" date="Posted: Thu Sep 30, 2004 1:40 am "><author>QuiXilver</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">ok figured out your tut on projected lights II

<br /><br />One of the problems with converting quake textures to doom is that in q3 the highlights were drawn into the texture, in doom the ingame texture is made up of diffusemaps, normalmaps &amp; specular that control the RGB, shadow &amp; highlight of the texture ingame. 
<br /><br />I'm sure at some stage there will be more texture sets to choose from, but at this stage in the game all mappers can do is wait for the texture folks to get some custom D3 sets out there, if your up for attempting to remake the textures check out the stickies in this forum, there's a whole load of decent info on texture creation to be found here.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p54200" date="Posted: Thu Sep 30, 2004 1:40 am "><author>QuiXilver</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">ok figured out your tut on projected lights II

<br /><br />I'm sure at some stage there will be more texture sets to choose from, but at this stage in the game all mappers can do is wait for the texture folks to get some custom D3 sets out there, if your up for attempting to remake the textures check out the stickies in this forum, there's a whole load of decent info on texture creation to be found here.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p54200" date="Posted: Thu Sep 30, 2004 1:40 am "><author>QuiXilver</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">ok figured out your tut on projected lights II

<br /><br />One of the problems with converting quake textures to doom is that in q3 the highlights were drawn into the texture, in doom the ingame texture is made up of diffusemaps, normalmaps &amp; specular that control the RGB, shadow &amp; highlight of the texture ingame. 
<br /><br />I'm sure at some stage there will be more texture sets to choose from, but at this stage in the game all mappers can do is wait for the texture folks to get some custom D3 sets out there, if your up for attempting to remake the textures check out the stickies in this forum, there's a whole load of decent info on texture creation to be found here.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p54200" date="Posted: Thu Sep 30, 2004 1:40 am "><author>QuiXilver</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">ok figured out your tut on projected lights II

<br /><br />One of the problems with converting quake textures to doom is that in q3 the highlights were drawn into the texture, in doom the ingame texture is made up of diffusemaps, normalmaps &amp; specular that control the RGB, shadow &amp; highlight of the texture ingame. 
<br /><br />I'm sure at some stage there will be more texture sets to choose from, but at this stage in the game all mappers can do is wait for the texture folks to get some custom D3 sets out there, if your up for attempting to remake the textures check out the stickies in this forum, there's a whole load of decent info on texture creation to be found here.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p54200" date="Posted: Thu Sep 30, 2004 1:40 am "><author>QuiXilver</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">ok figured out your tut on projected lights II

Looking forward to any and all tutorials, especially those related to the creation of textures for both the environments and models. Of course, if I knew what I were doing, I'd be glad to create some tutorials for the Doom community, however, I'm still a little shady (pardon the pun) on a few points. Once I know the requirements of the engine, I'm sure I'll be able to begin putting something together for us. Thanks again for all your hard work. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0"/><br/>_________________<br/>Peace,&#13;

How to make a glowing moving texture ect.&#13;

I'd suggest you walk yourself through the assload of tutorials in the scripting section before you complain about the absence of tutorials, let alone the list of tutorials in the level editing section.&#13;
<br/><br/>
When you're done, if 4 weeks or so, we'll have enough new tutorials to keep you busy till Christmas.&#13;
<br/><br/>
