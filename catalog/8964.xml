What it basically is, is a sky-dome with 2 layers of moving cloudtextures and a single covering dome with a gradient. This way you can create any type clouds and colors which you want to have and the results were astonishing. Yes there are some slight issues:
<br /><br />- How to optimize this ?
<br />- There is a slight white line at the horizon but this is due to the fact that I wasn't to precise when making this. This was just a test. In a production environment I'ld stick the layers so close to each other that these artefacts will not show up. Now they are kind of apart. 
<br />- If you walk totally up to the edge of the dome you can see that it's not a generated skytexture but actually just moving layers of flat textures. But because the dome is so big, that shouldn't happen at all. And poses no problem. 
<br /><br />This can be tweaked *lots* more.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121123338im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8)" title="Cool" /><br />I will leave the tweaking up to you guys.
<br /><br />You should make an extra layer at the horizon which will make it so the clouds seem to stretch into the horizon. You can add a planet / moon or sun to this easily. And you can change the entire look of this by adjusting the three textures that come with it for the clouds and the gradient. Red dusk skies or nighttime skies with stars are easily possible. You can add as much cloud layers as you'ld like as well.
<br /><br />You should see this in action, it looks lovely as the layers of clouds drift past eachother. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121123338im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /><br /><br />I will be releasing this by the end of this day and if you guys want to use it, be my guest!

<br />Polies is not the thing that impacts performance on maps in D3. It's polies that receive /cast specularlighting/shadows/normalmaps. All of which don't apply to the skydome.
<br /><br />In fact, I'm sure that one smoke emitter has twice more polies and performance impact than this skydome has. In comparison, the BFG has more tris than the skydome has.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p78578" date="Posted: Mon Feb 21, 2005 1:24 pm "><author>Gazado</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">just checked this out and one word:

<br /><br />Well, since it's not about the water but the skybox I wouldn't worry about that.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121123338im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /><br /><br />I don't have *any* performance drop at all with this sky. If you do experience one then it's because of the water and not the sky. The skydome mesh has 1008 tri's, these tris do not cast shadows, do not receive any light whatsoever nor do they receive specularity.
<br /><br />Compare that to the soulcube which has 1574 tris and I know that a performance drop due to this skydome is extremely unlikely if not impossible, and certainly negligable. 
<br /><br />The performance hit you're experiencing is due to the heathaze effect on the water.
<br /><br />I'll make a single map with a normal sky texure and then the same one with the dome to see what the performance does.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121123338im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p78594" date="Posted: Mon Feb 21, 2005 2:58 pm "><author>pbmax</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">looks nice blood.
<br /><br />here's an idea after looking at the dome pics (i did not download it). what if you did a flat sky instead of a curved dome?  a VERY wide and VERY  long single poly flat sky? make it so wide that it seems to stretch to the horizon (or just far enough depending on what the player can actually see). and then have the cloud textures scroll across that? that way the clouds would get smaller as they move across the sky.
<br /><br />just an idea...</div>]]></body></post><post id="p78595" date="Posted: Mon Feb 21, 2005 2:59 pm "><author>goliathvt</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">djester, you're probably testing this with the editor open... that's why you have the bad performance when you stand still.

The skydome performs 10-12 fps *better* than the regular texGen sky textures!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121123338im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />Remember, a texGen sky needs 6 textures of atleast 512x512 to work. The skydome only needs 3 plus a sky texgen needs extra calculations all the time to account for p.o.v. That's most likely the reason for so much of a performance gain in favor of the skydome.

<br /><br />If you had a map wrapped in a sky of this style then it'd be very wasteful resources, but for an open area like D3CDIT and other city-style areas its a great way to increase performance that extra bit <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121123338im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Anyway, its a really nice effect and if its less of a hit on the performance front all I can say again is "wow" and well done <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121123338im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p78612" date="Posted: Mon Feb 21, 2005 4:59 pm "><author>Kickboard</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Did they use that in the doom3 can do it too project that they released the other day ?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p78616" date="Posted: Mon Feb 21, 2005 5:33 pm "><author>dfloss</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">this is awesome bloodRayne, I was getting a bit depressed the other night after watching some quake 3 trick jumping video where one of the levels was basically floating in space with a beautiful sky above and the sea below.

<br /><br />This can be tweaked *lots* more.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121124107im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8)" title="Cool" /><br />I will leave the tweaking up to you guys.
<br /><br />You should make an extra layer at the horizon which will make it so the clouds seem to stretch into the horizon. You can add a planet / moon or sun to this easily. And you can change the entire look of this by adjusting the three textures that come with it for the clouds and the gradient. Red dusk skies or nighttime skies with stars are easily possible. You can add as much cloud layers as you'ld like as well.
<br /><br />You should see this in action, it looks lovely as the layers of clouds drift past eachother. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121124107im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /><br /><br />I will be releasing this by the end of this day and if you guys want to use it, be my guest!

<br />Polies is not the thing that impacts performance on maps in D3. It's polies that receive /cast specularlighting/shadows/normalmaps. All of which don't apply to the skydome.
<br /><br />In fact, I'm sure that one smoke emitter has twice more polies and performance impact than this skydome has. In comparison, the BFG has more tris than the skydome has.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p78578" date="Posted: Mon Feb 21, 2005 1:24 pm "><author>Gazado</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">just checked this out and one word:

<br /><br />Well, since it's not about the water but the skybox I wouldn't worry about that.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121124107im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /><br /><br />I don't have *any* performance drop at all with this sky. If you do experience one then it's because of the water and not the sky. The skydome mesh has 1008 tri's, these tris do not cast shadows, do not receive any light whatsoever nor do they receive specularity.
<br /><br />Compare that to the soulcube which has 1574 tris and I know that a performance drop due to this skydome is extremely unlikely if not impossible, and certainly negligable. 
<br /><br />The performance hit you're experiencing is due to the heathaze effect on the water.
<br /><br />I'll make a single map with a normal sky texure and then the same one with the dome to see what the performance does.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121124107im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p78594" date="Posted: Mon Feb 21, 2005 2:58 pm "><author>pbmax</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">looks nice blood.
<br /><br />here's an idea after looking at the dome pics (i did not download it). what if you did a flat sky instead of a curved dome?  a VERY wide and VERY  long single poly flat sky? make it so wide that it seems to stretch to the horizon (or just far enough depending on what the player can actually see). and then have the cloud textures scroll across that? that way the clouds would get smaller as they move across the sky.

<br />Gamma/brightness really is one of the most system dependant problems there is. What looks crisp and sharp on one system can look bland and washed out on another. There's really no fix for it other than letting people manually adjust their gamma/brightness settings according to an image to make sure they are getting the experience that the developer wanted them to have.
<br /><br />I can give an example, a screen like this should be used by every game/mod. I know we'll certainly put one into the Hexen TC.

<br />Absolutely. There's many ways to optimize this. I am planning to expand on this a lot. Like having a sun in there, which works via a deform sprite/add/blend mode. And I want to add extra planets in the skyline that slowly float and revolve around each other, perhaps a milkyway, behind the clouds and all dynamic. The more I test with this method, the more I believe that anything is possible at any resolution...  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121123130im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121123130im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil" /><br /><br />Skies like this should be absolutely possible:

<br /><br />Yeah, I agree with mikebart, for a quick fix to the perspective of the clouds at the horizon issue (if you can get close enough, or be able to see the horizon, which I'm afraid you nearly can from the top of my block in the D3CDIT project), keep the dome hape but just pull the sides out and down, so you end up with a very wide dome, but no higher than it is at present.
<br /><br />I think this should work as, afterall, this is what clouds do in real life.
<br /><br /><br />To Bloodrayne
<br />If you can get all that working, this will probably be one of the most important tools for the D3 mod community created so far, as it enables kinds of maps before D3 had no hope of ever convincingly creating, i.e. outdoor maps, and not just outdoor maps that are in a tiny little ditch on Mars.

<br /><br />thats the only thing i saw wrong with this method. since you are using a round dome, the cloud textures will not decrease in size as they moves toward the "horizon". i suggested using a HUGE single flat poly instead. someone else mentioned squishing the dome so the sides are further away like this shape 0 instead of this shape O.

<br /><br />Actually, the skydome is a tried way for making skies in 3dsMax, I am basically using the exact same method in D3 as I use in 3dsMax. 
<br /><br />It's a good idea to adjust the dome so it strechtes outward a bit. This testmodel was jsut a quick setup to see if it would work, which it does. So now it's just a matter of tweaking the models further until we find an ideal setup.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p78804" date="Posted: Tue Feb 22, 2005 8:00 pm "><author>Bauul</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I took a long hard look at the clouds in the sky today (in real life that is), and they really do look like they are in a 0 shape dome, they don't stretch for ever into the distance.

<br /><br />I think that remodelling is not the answer. I think that the answer is in the UV map for the texture itself. After adjusting the UV map a little bit you can achieve the exact same effect. 
<br /><br />b.t.w. I just added a 'sun' which is a simple square with an additive texture in between the gradient and the cloud layers and the effect is really convincing. The clouds now dim the sun as they should.

Whilst most people like lense flare, it is kind of odd in a game because it means you must be looking through a camera of some sort into the game world.  Most people don't realise this when playing, they just think it looks nice, but if you actually think about it, it kind of ruins the illusion of actually being there.
<br /><br />The other kind which I think probably creates a more realistic look, especially if you were actually there, is the method they used on Medal of Honor: Allied Assult (it may have been on others, I just haven't seen it), where looking at the sun simply creates a large bright blur on the screen, beyond the contours of the sun itself.  It sounds crap on paper (well, forum), but if you imagine in real life, if you let the sun creep into the edge of your vision, half your site goes all white and you have to squint.

<br /><br />I can't decide which would be best to use, both are completely exceptable in games and no-one would complain about either.  So, I suppose it's down to personal choice, or ease of implimentation.

<br /><br />A lens is the most obvious source of refraction but even simple glass, fog or temperature differences are also sources of refraction of various degrees. When you're driving at night the windshield of your car can create halos on streetlamps. If the DOOM guy still had his helmet (grrrr) flares would be quite appropriate. They're certainly appropriate on the fog-ladden landscapes of the Hexen mythos.
<br /><br />Speaking of which, BloodRayne, as a fan of the original Hexen I must say you and your team have really nailed the atmosphere of the setting. Your TC has been at the top of my (short) list of mods I'm very much looking forward to. This last breakthrough is just one of many that I personally appreciate very, very much. Keep up the most excellent work.

<br /><br />Absolutely, I just think something subtle based on the realistic reasoning you suggest (and Bauul suggested) goes far further than the 'over the top' multi glass refraction that makes it look like you are viewing through a 600mm zoom lens.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121122152im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p78885" date="Posted: Wed Feb 23, 2005 7:45 am "><author>zakath</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">that sky and enviroment looks really really really really good. hl2 fanboys should see that and try saying again "doom3 can't do nice outdoors"</div>]]></body></post><post id="p78900" date="Posted: Wed Feb 23, 2005 10:51 am "><author>johnokaner</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Excuse my stupidity (make that plugin  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121122152im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> ) rich_is_board but what is the uv map.

<br />The UV map is the way that a texture map is wrapped around a model.

<br /><br />HDR is actually only supported on a small amount of machines in Far Cry. Most medium end machines can't run it, and as far as I remember only a certain set of videocards can support it. 
<br /><br />In any case it's hard to compare the D3 engine to the Far Cry engine since they both were designed for different things. Far Cry can by far create much more exotic and huge outdoor scenes than D3 can, but D3 is much better when it comes to indoor scenes. It all depends on what you want to get. But now I'm going offtopic.
<br /><br />I think a fake HDR effect can be put into this method of making skies using a simple script, shaderparms and a well placed shader. I may or may not look into that as it's not a big priority, allthough I'm sure others will pick up on this method and might try to implement it for themselves.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121122152im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p79143" date="Posted: Thu Feb 24, 2005 2:44 pm "><author>pbmax</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">imo, using the method found in games such as medal of honor (quake based game too i think) is pretty good. the closer you look towards the sun, the more washed out the screen becomes. its simple but effective...</div>]]></body></post><post id="p79144" date="Posted: Thu Feb 24, 2005 2:47 pm "><author>Bauul</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">pbmax wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">imo, using the method found in games such as medal of honor (quake based game too i think) is pretty good. the closer you look towards the sun, the more washed out the screen becomes. its simple but effective...</div>

<br /><br />Actually I think BloodRayne explained it somewhere on these boards (Or possibly even in the first post of this topic), but I'll do it again.
<br /><br />There are some textures supplied with BloodRayne's skydome (Two cloud textures and one sky color texture, and some other ones that arent used I think), you can just recolor those in a paint program. Or you can do what I did and create some completely new ones. Or infact you could fool around with the RBG values in the material file (I havent done this though).

What it basically is, is a sky-dome with 2 layers of moving cloudtextures and a single covering dome with a gradient. This way you can create any type clouds and colors which you want to have and the results were astonishing. Yes there are some slight issues:
<br /><br />- How to optimize this ?
<br />- There is a slight white line at the horizon but this is due to the fact that I wasn't to precise when making this. This was just a test. In a production environment I'ld stick the layers so close to each other that these artefacts will not show up. Now they are kind of apart. 
<br />- If you walk totally up to the edge of the dome you can see that it's not a generated skytexture but actually just moving layers of flat textures. But because the dome is so big, that shouldn't happen at all. And poses no problem. 
<br /><br />This can be tweaked *lots* more.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121124107im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8)" title="Cool" /><br />I will leave the tweaking up to you guys.
<br /><br />You should make an extra layer at the horizon which will make it so the clouds seem to stretch into the horizon. You can add a planet / moon or sun to this easily. And you can change the entire look of this by adjusting the three textures that come with it for the clouds and the gradient. Red dusk skies or nighttime skies with stars are easily possible. You can add as much cloud layers as you'ld like as well.
<br /><br />You should see this in action, it looks lovely as the layers of clouds drift past eachother. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121124107im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /><br /><br />I will be releasing this by the end of this day and if you guys want to use it, be my guest!

<br />Polies is not the thing that impacts performance on maps in D3. It's polies that receive /cast specularlighting/shadows/normalmaps. All of which don't apply to the skydome.
<br /><br />In fact, I'm sure that one smoke emitter has twice more polies and performance impact than this skydome has. In comparison, the BFG has more tris than the skydome has.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p78578" date="Posted: Mon Feb 21, 2005 1:24 pm "><author>Gazado</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">just checked this out and one word:

<br /><br />Well, since it's not about the water but the skybox I wouldn't worry about that.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121124107im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /><br /><br />I don't have *any* performance drop at all with this sky. If you do experience one then it's because of the water and not the sky. The skydome mesh has 1008 tri's, these tris do not cast shadows, do not receive any light whatsoever nor do they receive specularity.
<br /><br />Compare that to the soulcube which has 1574 tris and I know that a performance drop due to this skydome is extremely unlikely if not impossible, and certainly negligable. 
<br /><br />The performance hit you're experiencing is due to the heathaze effect on the water.
<br /><br />I'll make a single map with a normal sky texure and then the same one with the dome to see what the performance does.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121124107im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p78594" date="Posted: Mon Feb 21, 2005 2:58 pm "><author>pbmax</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">looks nice blood.
<br /><br />here's an idea after looking at the dome pics (i did not download it). what if you did a flat sky instead of a curved dome?  a VERY wide and VERY  long single poly flat sky? make it so wide that it seems to stretch to the horizon (or just far enough depending on what the player can actually see). and then have the cloud textures scroll across that? that way the clouds would get smaller as they move across the sky.

The skydome only needs 3 plus a sky texgen needs extra calculations all the time to account for p.o.v. That's most likely the reason for so much of a performance gain in favor of the skydome.

<br />Gamma/brightness really is one of the most system dependant problems there is. What looks crisp and sharp on one system can look bland and washed out on another. There's really no fix for it other than letting people manually adjust their gamma/brightness settings according to an image to make sure they are getting the experience that the developer wanted them to have.
<br /><br />I can give an example, a screen like this should be used by every game/mod. I know we'll certainly put one into the Hexen TC.

<br /><br />If you extracted it using the path information in the zip, it will have created a directory under Doom3 called skybox. This needs to be selected from the mod menu in-game. Then you type in map sky_box.  Works fine.

<br />Absolutely. There's many ways to optimize this. I am planning to expand on this a lot. Like having a sun in there, which works via a deform sprite/add/blend mode. And I want to add extra planets in the skyline that slowly float and revolve around each other, perhaps a milkyway, behind the clouds and all dynamic. The more I test with this method, the more I believe that anything is possible at any resolution...  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121123130im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121123130im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil" /><br /><br />Skies like this should be absolutely possible:

<br /><br />Yeah, I agree with mikebart, for a quick fix to the perspective of the clouds at the horizon issue (if you can get close enough, or be able to see the horizon, which I'm afraid you nearly can from the top of my block in the D3CDIT project), keep the dome hape but just pull the sides out and down, so you end up with a very wide dome, but no higher than it is at present.
<br /><br />I think this should work as, afterall, this is what clouds do in real life.
<br /><br /><br />To Bloodrayne
<br />If you can get all that working, this will probably be one of the most important tools for the D3 mod community created so far, as it enables kinds of maps before D3 had no hope of ever convincingly creating, i.e. outdoor maps, and not just outdoor maps that are in a tiny little ditch on Mars.

<br /><br />thats the only thing i saw wrong with this method. since you are using a round dome, the cloud textures will not decrease in size as they moves toward the "horizon". i suggested using a HUGE single flat poly instead. someone else mentioned squishing the dome so the sides are further away like this shape 0 instead of this shape O.

<br /><br />Actually, the skydome is a tried way for making skies in 3dsMax, I am basically using the exact same method in D3 as I use in 3dsMax. 
<br /><br />It's a good idea to adjust the dome so it strechtes outward a bit. This testmodel was jsut a quick setup to see if it would work, which it does. So now it's just a matter of tweaking the models further until we find an ideal setup.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p78804" date="Posted: Tue Feb 22, 2005 8:00 pm "><author>Bauul</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I took a long hard look at the clouds in the sky today (in real life that is), and they really do look like they are in a 0 shape dome, they don't stretch for ever into the distance.

<br /><br />I think that remodelling is not the answer. I think that the answer is in the UV map for the texture itself. After adjusting the UV map a little bit you can achieve the exact same effect. 
<br /><br />b.t.w. I just added a 'sun' which is a simple square with an additive texture in between the gradient and the cloud layers and the effect is really convincing. The clouds now dim the sun as they should.

Whilst most people like lense flare, it is kind of odd in a game because it means you must be looking through a camera of some sort into the game world.  Most people don't realise this when playing, they just think it looks nice, but if you actually think about it, it kind of ruins the illusion of actually being there.
<br /><br />The other kind which I think probably creates a more realistic look, especially if you were actually there, is the method they used on Medal of Honor: Allied Assult (it may have been on others, I just haven't seen it), where looking at the sun simply creates a large bright blur on the screen, beyond the contours of the sun itself.  It sounds crap on paper (well, forum), but if you imagine in real life, if you let the sun creep into the edge of your vision, half your site goes all white and you have to squint.  They played it down for MOH, else you'd always have a big white glare on the screen, so that only when you stared more or less directly at the sun you got the glare.
<br /><br />I can't decide which would be best to use, both are completely exceptable in games and no-one would complain about either.  So, I suppose it's down to personal choice, or ease of implimentation.
<br /><br />Something tells me the lense flare would be harder to get working, but easier to get looking good, where as the flare would be easy to get working, but harder to make look convincing.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p78826" date="Posted: Tue Feb 22, 2005 10:16 pm "><author>docbloke</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">The other kind which I think probably creates a more realistic look, especially if you were actually there, is the method they used on Medal of Honor: Allied Assult (it may have been on others, I just haven't seen it), where looking at the sun simply creates a large bright blur on the screen, beyond the contours of the sun itself.

<br /><br />A lens is the most obvious source of refraction but even simple glass, fog or temperature differences are also sources of refraction of various degrees. When you're driving at night the windshield of your car can create halos on streetlamps. If the DOOM guy still had his helmet (grrrr) flares would be quite appropriate. They're certainly appropriate on the fog-ladden landscapes of the Hexen mythos.
<br /><br />Speaking of which, BloodRayne, as a fan of the original Hexen I must say you and your team have really nailed the atmosphere of the setting. Your TC has been at the top of my (short) list of mods I'm very much looking forward to. This last breakthrough is just one of many that I personally appreciate very, very much. Keep up the most excellent work.
<br /><br />As for the sun flare can you use deform flare somehow?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p78835" date="Posted: Tue Feb 22, 2005 11:04 pm "><author>docbloke</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">A lens is the most obvious source of refraction but even simple glass, fog or temperature differences are also sources of refraction of various degrees.

<br /><br />Absolutely, I just think something subtle based on the realistic reasoning you suggest (and Bauul suggested) goes far further than the 'over the top' multi glass refraction that makes it look like you are viewing through a 600mm zoom lens.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121122152im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p78885" date="Posted: Wed Feb 23, 2005 7:45 am "><author>zakath</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">that sky and enviroment looks really really really really good. hl2 fanboys should see that and try saying again "doom3 can't do nice outdoors"</div>]]></body></post><post id="p78900" date="Posted: Wed Feb 23, 2005 10:51 am "><author>johnokaner</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Excuse my stupidity (make that plugin  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121122152im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> ) rich_is_board but what is the uv map.

<br />The UV map is the way that a texture map is wrapped around a model.

<br /><br />HDR is actually only supported on a small amount of machines in Far Cry. Most medium end machines can't run it, and as far as I remember only a certain set of videocards can support it. 
<br /><br />In any case it's hard to compare the D3 engine to the Far Cry engine since they both were designed for different things. Far Cry can by far create much more exotic and huge outdoor scenes than D3 can, but D3 is much better when it comes to indoor scenes. It all depends on what you want to get. But now I'm going offtopic.
<br /><br />I think a fake HDR effect can be put into this method of making skies using a simple script, shaderparms and a well placed shader. I may or may not look into that as it's not a big priority, allthough I'm sure others will pick up on this method and might try to implement it for themselves.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121122152im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p79143" date="Posted: Thu Feb 24, 2005 2:44 pm "><author>pbmax</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">imo, using the method found in games such as medal of honor (quake based game too i think) is pretty good. the closer you look towards the sun, the more washed out the screen becomes. its simple but effective...</div>]]></body></post><post id="p79144" date="Posted: Thu Feb 24, 2005 2:47 pm "><author>Bauul</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">pbmax wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">imo, using the method found in games such as medal of honor (quake based game too i think) is pretty good. the closer you look towards the sun, the more washed out the screen becomes. its simple but effective...</div>

<br />you should take a look at Quake2maX
<br />the coder uses that effect pretty good in his latest release
<br /><br />(for testers: download dday normandy, apply Q2maX, and load the map dday2

<br /><br />Actually I think BloodRayne explained it somewhere on these boards (Or possibly even in the first post of this topic), but I'll do it again.
<br /><br />There are some textures supplied with BloodRayne's skydome (Two cloud textures and one sky color texture, and some other ones that arent used I think), you can just recolor those in a paint program. Or you can do what I did and create some completely new ones. Or infact you could fool around with the RBG values in the material file (I havent done this though).

<br />I noticed one, yes. I also noticed the new skyportals which I'm trying to get to work a.t.m. for me.
