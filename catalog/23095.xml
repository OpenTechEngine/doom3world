Nothing says messing with powers beyond their reckoning like the aforementioned powers turning against them.<br />The most new wolf does is having the occult dude say as much directly, and as they say in movies, don't tell show, and in the case of games - the enemy of my enemy is ohmygodgoingtokillusall. Fear is a communicable disease :p<br />Ok, so there is the hulk type enemy in new wolf that only shows up twice.<br /><br />I'm also seeing from playing through where new Wolf really tried to pull situations and gameplay elements from rtcw, also poking the new wolfs various files you can see at one point it was a lot closer.<br />I'll post more thoughts once I'm further through RTCW.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p218253" date="Posted: Thu Sep 03, 2009 10:19 am "><author>Dafama2k7</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">One of the things i liked most of the great RTCW IdTech3 based game was and still is, the scarier Catacombs levels with hundreds of zombies and the like appearing from many different places, even in most parts it was more scary to me than Doom 3 is !<br /><br />its sad that the NEW 2k9 Wolfenstein IdTech4 based game didn't redo this again, oh, why Raven, why ??? <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320002745im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p218259" date="Posted: Thu Sep 03, 2009 4:47 pm "><author>Hostyle</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Yeah, RTCW is scary sometimes, esp if you forget scare placement.
