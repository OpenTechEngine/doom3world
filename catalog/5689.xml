<br /><br />Edit, don't feel like a wooden box is what you have to stick to, think out of the box. [slaps self]
<br /><br />It's about time we had an informal challenge here at Doom3world, so here it is. The aim of the challenge is to learn new texture making techniques and to pass on information to fellow texture artists whilst giving constructive feedback to fellow members. Whilst creating some new crate textures that could be converted to models at a later stage.
<br /><br /><ul><span style="font-weight: bold">The minimum submission requirements for the challenge are: </span><br /><li>An in game shot of the texture/s, in jpg format.</li><li>The composite textures: diffuse, specular &amp; normal. </li><li>an explanation into the process &amp; working insight.</li><li>Please do not use any material or images that have a Copyright © without the owners permission if it's needed.</li></ul>Post all submissions in a post in this thread,  there is no deadline to this challenge.
<br /><br />It is also encouraged that people post links to zips that are hosted by the author, or independently hosted. The links will be posted in a submissions thread that will be started when needed.

<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.greg-taylor.co.uk/forumhost/shot00050.jpg" class="postlink">http://www.greg-taylor.co.uk/forumhost/shot00050.jpg</a>
<br /><br />is a quick crate I knocked up using an image from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.theory.org/~strthrwr/patterns/index.html" class="postlink">http://www.theory.org/~strthrwr/patterns/index.html</a>
<br /><br />The image of a crate with a handle hole in it was used for the sides of the crate. The front/back of the crate was made firstly by using the clone stamp tool in Photoshop to touch out the handle. The explosive symbol came from a Return to Castle Wolfenstein texture  (I had to add the 'e' on the end since the sign was in german) which was added as a new layer with the blend mode set to hard light.
<br /><br />For the top of the crate I again used the clone stamp tool to remove the handle hole and added some minor stains using a grunge-ey photoshop brush that I made up. The bottom was the same apart from the fact that I cloned the rust all the way around the edge of the metal to match up with the  bottom of the fromt/side textures.
<br /><br />All four of these were combined into a single image which was duplicated twice for work on the normal and specular maps. Both of these were simply painted by hand (over the top of the existing design for reference) in acordance with what parts ought to be shiny/dull or raised/inset.
<br /><br />Finally I wrote the following simple material code to get the textures into the game:
<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">textures/ubiquitous/phototex/ubicrate01<br />{ <br />    qer_editorimage     textures/ubiquitous/phototex/ubicrate01_d.tga          // custom DOOMEdit material preview image <br />    diffusemap      textures/ubiquitous/phototex/ubicrate01_d.tga                // color and value information for the material <br />    bumpmap         textures/ubiquitous/phototex/ubicrate01_local.tga      // normalmap for bumpmapped appearance <br />    specularmap     textures/ubiquitous/phototex/ubicrate01_s.tga          // specular highlights <br />}</div>
<br /><br />The actual texture files themselves are availible here:

<br /><br />I know this isnt the best texture in the world but hey, someone had to get the ball rolling.

<br /><br />Originaly designed to be a door. But I thought it could also be ok for a crate. The original texture is 1024*512, it been resized.
<br />Concerning the diffuse map: the wood is taken from a photo of a furniture and tweaked a bit ... less brightness and color changes. I also added a dirty concrete wall layer in overlay mode. But it doesn't jump to the eye.
<br />The metal textures are a metl of height map, concrete overlay, metal photo and scratches made of noise and motion blur.
<br />I used to same idea for nails but I added some blending options.
<br /><br />Specular map : I kept the wood surface darker so it won't be too shiny whereas the metal parts are just following the diffuse map brightness in grayscale.
<br /><br />Bumpmap : Is mainly some reworked wood surface + metal heightmap with nvidia height to local converter applied on it.
<br /><br /><br />For the barell here's the picture

<br />I started with the grayscale, then added a sloppy diffuse <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br />and for the specularmap my alltime favorite:
<br />I take the grayscale and use the Glowing Edges Filter
<br />(Photoshop: Filter &gt; Stylize &gt; Glowing Edges...)
<br />Looks nice on metal and stone textures too! This filter also works great on normalmaps, in case you have renderbumpflated a model and need a specular for that.
<br />Well, it's a good start at least.
<br /><br />Grayscale, Local, Diffuse, Specular (gamma-corrected)

<br />The light edging around the Specularmap was made by using a combination of the diffuse along with the normalmap texture using the editor creation method (desaturate, auto contrast) then Copy, rotate 180 &amp; paste, use blending &amp; merge layers, then blending exclusion was used.
<br /><br />My crate was created using PS and the nvidia normalmap plugin.

This was my first time creating a heightmap and the first time using nvidia's plugin - I really hated the way it worked: I created some simple heightmaps and it'd create some really weird normal maps - but I guess I have to learn to use it properly.
<br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://hosted.zeh.com.br/misc/11_09_2005/crate2.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />I got the wood normals wrong - I tried several tricks to make it look like wood sulks without looking comic-like but in the end the heights didn't work like I wanted them to. Anyways, it's ok for a first, I guess.
<br /><br />I did everything following the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=2659" class="postlink">texture tutorials</a>. Good tutorials.
<br /><br />I only did one of the crate sides btw.
<br /><br />Here it is: diffuse, specular, normal maps.

The rounded stamp was from images.google.com. The receipt was from google too. The rest was done on photoshop.
<br /><br />Here's some of the references I used, and the stamp and receipt images. I don't know what they are and they're probably subject to copyright, but it was just a personal lesson and not for distribution so I guess it's not a problem.
