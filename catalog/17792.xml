The stones are high poly 3d models in 3dsmax8, the mortar is made up of 3 overlayed alpha channeled textures creating the illusion of blending between the stones and mortar, if you look closely at the closup shot you should see what i mean, problem is; I cant get the 'projection modifier' to project alpha channels, it seems to only render geometry, which is fine if im only using it to render normal maps but rendering alphas for the diffuse would be a great advantage.
