<br />Yep that's right. If you use the first animation frame as the baseframe instead of the bindpose, chances are that you can save some md5anim filesize because values that never change from their baseframe value don't have to be included in the animation data.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p167349" date="Posted: Sat Jan 13, 2007 8:39 pm "><author>ehmdjii</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">thanks der_ton.

Yep that's right. If you use the first animation frame as the baseframe instead of the bindpose, chances are that you can save some md5anim filesize because values that never change from their baseframe value don't have to be included in the animation data.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/" target="_blank" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/site/img/d3w.gif" border="0"/> Staff</a>&#13;

Yep that's right. If you use the first animation frame as the baseframe instead of the bindpose, chances are that you can save some md5anim filesize because values that never change from their baseframe value don't have to be included in the animation data.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/" target="_blank" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/site/img/d3w.gif" border="0"/> Staff</a>&#13;

<br/>
i am writing an md5exporter in mel.&#13;
<br/><br/>
if i understood it then the baseframe part in an md5anim file is a frame to which all other frames are relative. right?&#13;
<br/><br/>
my question is how do i get the baseframe?&#13;
<br/>
what is it? is it the bindbose?&#13;
<br/><br/>
technically i can choose the baseframe myself as long as the relative joint rotations and translations in the other frames are correct. right?</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

Exporting animations from Maya to md5 is only possible with the MayaImportX86.dll from Doom3 afaik. &#13;

yepp the dll has not been working for maya8 for me. &#13;

maybe i can look into that importer to get information for my exporter. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0"/><br/><br/>
but back to the original question:&#13;
<br/><br/>
what exactly is the definition of this "baseframe" int the md5anim file.</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

Yep that's right. If you use the first animation frame as the baseframe instead of the bindpose, chances are that you can save some md5anim filesize because values that never change from their baseframe value don't have to be included in the animation data.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/" target="_blank" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/site/img/d3w.gif" border="0"/> Staff</a>&#13;

i know you are more into max and blender, but do you by any chance know a way on how to get the weights positions in maya?</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

You have to calculate the md5 weight positions from the vertex positions and the bone transform matrices. A "weight position" is the position of that weight's vertex, expressed in that weight's bone's local coordinate space.&#13;
<br/><br/>
weight.pos = vertex.bindpose_pos * inverted(bone.bindpose_modelspacematrix)&#13;
<br/><br/>
In other words, the weight position is such that&#13;
<br/>
vertex.animated_pos = weight.pos * bone.animated_modelspacematrix&#13;
<br/>
which is the core of skeletal animation, and which probably looks more familiar.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/" target="_blank" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/site/img/d3w.gif" border="0"/> Staff</a>&#13;

thanks a lot der_ton.&#13;
<br/><br/>
anybody happens to know what the corresponding variables are in MEL?&#13;
<br/>
i.e. how do i query vertex.bind_pos and bone.bindpose_modelspacematrix ?&#13;
