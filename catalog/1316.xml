  <div class="quotecontent">The lizard brain<br /><br />Maybe you remember way back in school when you learned that the human brain still contains a prehistoric lizard brain at its center. This is the key to understanding women and what you can expect from them.<br /><br />Women still have direct contact with the lizard brain, something which men have been able to shut down about a trillion centuries ago.<br /><br />Have you ever noticed how women get cold very easily even if the temperature is only 1 µC below optimum? That's because lizards are cold-blooded, and a woman's lizard brain is telling her that she better get to a warm place quickly or her muscles will freeze up and her heart will stop beating.<br /><br />Have you noticed how a woman always seems to be thinking about two things at once? That's because a lizard's eyes point in two different directions, so it always has to process two completely different scenes.<br /><br />Have you noticed how two women can hate each other and have a serious fight, even if they don't know each other and they are sitting on opposite sides of the room? Lizards are very territorial and fight with each other by standing in one place and making threatening movements.<br /><br />Have you ever noticed how a woman drives? It's that two-direction eye problem again. That's why she thinks that it's possible to drive at high speed on a roundabout while looking in the mirror and adjusting her make-up.<br /><br />Have you noticed how a woman can sit somewhere completely happy, then suddenly out of nowhere she begins to cut you to pieces with her tongue? Well, just watch a lizard catch flies and you will know where that comes from.<br /><br />Women can lay in the sun on a big rock all day and never get bored.<br /><br />If a woman gets the chance, and she thinks that she can get away with it, she will color her hair orange and green and get it styled into a spiky hairdo. This is definitely a lizard haircut.<br /><br />I'm sure that there are hundreds of examples. The point is, the lizard brain theory explains everything. I am expecting to win the Nobel Prize this year.</div>

Gross! No way!" But it's so cool! My boyfriends get totally turned on by watching me lube up, and I don't worry anymore about getting pregnant. And anal is definitely the fast track to the "in" crowd: Ever since I started taking it anal, I've been way popular at school!<br /><br /><br />JEREMY T., Holyoke, MA<br />I have to admit, when I first suggested anal sex to my girlfriend, she looked at me like I was crazy. I offered to double-wrap, use plenty of AstroGlide, but she was still totally freaked over the idea of it. Then she made a deal with me: If I'd bend over for her strap-on, she'd bend over for me. We take turns taking it up the poop chute, and now we finally feel like our relationship is fully equal.</div>

<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Hey,<br />This is a conversation between a father and a son...you will probably understand the reason why US attacked Iraq and how the world functions better after reading<br />this.<br /><br />Q: Daddy, why did we have to attack Iraq?<br />A: Because they had weapons of mass destruction,  honey.<br /><br />Q: But the inspectors didn't find any weapons of mass destruction.<br />A: That's because the Iraqis were hiding them.<br /><br />Q: And that's why we invaded Iraq?<br />A: Yep. Invasions always work better than  inspections.<br /><br />Q: But after we invaded them, we STILL didn't find any weapons  of mass destruction, did we?<br />A: That's because the weapons are so well hidden. Don't worry, we'll find something, probably right before the 2004 election.<br /><br />Q: Why did Iraq want all those weapons of mass  destruction?<br />A: To use them in a war, silly.<br /><br />Q: I'm confused. If they had all those weapons that they planned to use in a war, then why didn't they use any of those weapons when we  went to war with them?<br />A: Well, obviously they didn't want anyone to know they had  those weapons,so they chose to die by the thousands rather than defend themselves.<br /><br />Q: That doesn't make sense Daddy. Why would they choose to die  if they had all those big weapons to fight us back with?<br />A: It's a different culture. It's not supposed to make  sense.<br /><br />Q: I don't know about you, but I don't think they had any of those weapons our government said they did.<br />A: Well, you know, it doesn't matter whether or not they had those weapons. We had another good reason to invade them anyway.<br /><br />Q: And what was that?<br />A: Even if Iraq didn't have weapons of mass destruction, Saddam Hussein was a cruel dictator, which is another good reason to invade another country.<br /><br />Q: Why? What does a cruel dictator do that makes it OK to invade his country?<br />A: Well, for one thing, he tortured his own people.<br /><br />Q: Kind of like what they do in China?<br />A: Don't go comparing China to Iraq. China is a good economic competitor, where millions of people work for slave wages in sweatshops to make U.S. corporations richer.<br /><br />Q: So if a country lets its people be exploited for American corporate<br />gain, it's a good country, even if that country tortures people?<br />A: Right.<br /><br />Q: Why were people in Iraq being tortured?<br />A: For political crimes, mostly, like criticizing the  government. People who criticized the government in Iraq were sent to prison and tortured.<br /><br />Q: Isn't that exactly what happens in China?<br />A: I told you, China is different.<br /><br />Q: What's the difference between China and Iraq?<br />A: Well, for one thing, Iraq was ruled by the Ba'ath party, while China is Communist.<br /><br />Q: Didn't you once tell me Communists were bad?<br />A: No, just Cuban Communists are bad.<br /><br />Q: How are the Cuban Communists bad?<br />A: Well, for one thing, people who criticize the government in Cuba are sent to prison and tortured.<br /><br />Q: Like in Iraq?<br />A: Exactly.<br /><br />Q: And like in China, too?<br />A: I told you, China's a good economic competitor. Cuba, on the other hand, is not.<br /><br />Q: How come Cuba isn't a good economic competitor?<br />A: Well, you see, back in the early 1960s, our government passed some laws that made it illegal for Americans to trade or do any business with Cuba until they stopped being Communists and started being capitalists like us.<br /><br />Q: But if we got rid of those laws, opened up trade with Cuba,and started doing business with them, wouldn't that help the Cubans become capitalists?<br />A: Don't be a smart-ass.<br /><br />Q: I didn't think I was being one.<br />A: Well, anyway, they also don't have freedom of religion in Cuba.<br /><br />Q: Kind of like China and the @!#$ movement?<br />A: I told you, stop saying bad things about China. Anyway,  Saddam Hussein came to power through a military coup, so he's not really a legitimate leader anyway.<br /><br />Q: What's a military coup?<br />A: That's when a military general takes over the government of a country by force, instead of holding free elections like we do in the United States.<br /><br />Q: Didn't the ruler of Pakistan come to power by a military coup?<br />A: You mean General Pervez Musharraf? Uh, yeah, he did, but Pakistan is our friend.<br /><br />Q: Why is Pakistan our friend if their leader is illegitimate?<br />A: I never said Pervez Musharraf was illegitimate.<br /><br />Q: Didn't you just say a military general who comes to power by forcibly overthrowing the legitimate government of a nation is an illegitimate leader?<br />A: Only Saddam Hussein. Pervez Musharraf is our friend, because he helped us invade Afghanistan.<br /><br />Q: Why did we invade Afghanistan?<br />A: Because of what they did to us on September 11th.<br /><br />Q: What did Afghanistan do to us on September 11th?<br />A: Well, on September 11th, nineteen men, fifteen of them Saudi Arabians, hijacked four airplanes and flew three of them into buildings,killing over 3,000 Americans.<br /><br />Q: So how did Afghanistan figure into all that?<br />A: Afghanistan was where those bad men trained, under the oppressive rule of the Taliban.<br /><br />Q: Aren't the Taliban those bad radical Islamics who chopped off people's heads and hands?<br />A: Yes, that's exactly who they were. Not only did they chop off people's heads and hands, but they oppressed women, too.<br /><br />Q: Didn't the Bush administration giv e the Taliban 43 million dollars back in May of 2001?<br />A: Yes, but that money was a reward because they did such a good job fighting drugs.<br /><br />Q: Fighting drugs?<br />A: Yes, the Taliban were very helpful in stopping people from growing opium poppies.<br /><br />Q: How did they do such a good job?<br />A: Simple. If people were caught growing opium poppies, the Taliban would have their hands and heads cut off.<br /><br />Q: So, when the Taliban cut off people's heads and hands for growing flowers, that was OK, but not if they cut people's heads and hands off for other reasons?<br />A: Yes. It's OK with us if radical Islamic fundamentalists cut off people's hands for growing flowers, but it's cruel if they cut off people's hands for stealing bread.<br /><br />Q: Don't they also cut off people's hands and heads in Saudi Arabia?<br />A: That's different. Afghanistan was ruled by a tyrannical patriarchy that oppressed women and forced them to wear burqas whenever they  were in public, with death by stoning as the penalty for women who did not comply.<br /><br />Q: Don't Saudi women have to wear burqas in public,  too?<br />A: No, Saudi women merely wear a traditional Islamic body overing.<br /><br />Q: What's the difference?<br />A: The traditional Islamic co! vering worn by Saudi women is a modest yet fashionable garment that covers all of a woman's body xcept for her eyes and fingers. The burqa, on the other hand, is an evil tool of patriarchal oppression that covers all of a woman's body except for her eyes<br />and fingers.<br /><br />Q: It sounds like the same thing with a different  name.<br />A: Now, don't go comparing Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia. The Saudis are our friends.<br /><br />Q: But I thought you said 15 of the 19 hijackers on September 11th were from Saudi Arabia.<br />A: Yes, but they trained in Afghanistan.<br /><br />Q: Who trained them?<br />A: A very bad man named Osama bin Laden.<br /><br />Q: Was he from Afghanist! an?<br />A: Uh, no, he was from Saudi Arabia too. But he was a bad man, a very bad man.<br /><br />Q: I seem to recall he was our friend once.<br />A: Only when we helped him and the mujahadeen repel the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan back in the 1980s.<br /><br />Q: Who are the Soviets? Was that the Evil Communist Empire  Ronald Reagan talked about?<br />A: There are no more Soviets. The Soviet Union broke up in 1990 or there abouts, and now they have elections and capitalism like us. We call them Russians now.<br /><br />Q: So the Soviets, I mean, the Russians, are now our  friends?<br />A: Well, not really. You see, they were our friends for many years after they stopped being Soviets, bu t then they decided not to support our invasion of Iraq, so we're mad at them now. We're also mad at  the French and the Germans because they didn't help us invade Iraqe ither.<br /><br />Q: So the French and Germans are evil, too?<br />A: Not exactly evil, but just bad enough that we had to rename French fries and French toast to Freedom Fries and Freedom Toast.<br /><br />Q: Do we always rename foods whenever another country doesn't do what we want them to do?<br />A: No, we just do that to our friends. Our enemies, we  invade.<br /><br />Q: But wasn't Iraq one of our friends back in the  1980s?<br />A: Well, yeah. For a while.<br /><br />Q: Was Saddam Hussein ruler of Iraq back then?<br />A: Yes, but at the time he was fighting against Iran, which made him our friend, temporarily.<br /><br />Q: Why did that make him our friend?<br />A: Because at that time, Iran was our enemy.<br /><br />Q: Isn't that when he gassed the Kurds?<br />A: Yeah, but since he was fighting against Iran at the time, we looked the other way, to show him we were his friend.<br /><br />Q: So anyone who fights against one of our enemies automatically becomes our friend?<br />A: Most of the time, yes.<br /><br />Q: And anyone who fights against one of our friends is automatically an enemy?<br />A: Sometimes that's true, t! oo. However, if American corporations can profit by selling weapons to both sides at the same time, all  the better.<br /><br />Q: Why?<br />A: Because war is good for the economy, which meanswar is good for America. Also, since God is on America's side, anyone who opposes war is  a godless un-American Communist. Do you understand now why we attacked Iraq?<br /><br />Q: I think so. We attacked them because God wanted us to,r ight?<br />A: Yes.<br /><br />Q: But how did we know God wanted us to attack Iraq?<br />A: Well, you see, God personally speaks to George W. Bush and tells him what to do.<br /><br />Q: So basically, what you're saying is that we attacked Iraq because George W. Bush hears voices in his head?<br />A. Yes! You finally understand how the world works. Now close your eyes, make yourself comfortable, and go to sleep. Good night.<br /><br />Good night, Daddy.<br /></div></div>]]></body></post><post id="p13617" date="Posted: Sun Sep 28, 2003 6:00 am "><author>[sic]</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">That's great _shank.

It is Very difficult to positively identify the surface by just looking at it. So, how do we determine with any amount of certainty what type of mirror we are looking at? 
<br /><br />CONDUCT THIS SIMPLE TEST: Place the tip of your fingernail against the reflective surface and if there is a GAP between your fingernail and the image of the nail, then it is a GENUINE mirror. However, if your fingernail DIRECTLY TOUCHES the image of your nail, then BEWARE, IT IS A 2-WAY MIRROR! (there is someone seeing you from the other side).  The reason there is a gap on a real mirror, is because the silver is on the back of the mirror UNDER the glass. Whereas with a two-way mirror, the silver is on the surface. Keep it in mind! Make sure and check every time you enter in hotel rooms. May be someone is making a film on you.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p15645" date="Posted: Fri Nov 21, 2003 8:01 am "><author>Rayne</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">So basically, what you're saying is that we attacked Iraq because George W.

  <div class="quotecontent">The lizard brain<br /><br />Maybe you remember way back in school when you learned that the human brain still contains a prehistoric lizard brain at its center. This is the key to understanding women and what you can expect from them.<br /><br />Women still have direct contact with the lizard brain, something which men have been able to shut down about a trillion centuries ago.<br /><br />Have you ever noticed how women get cold very easily even if the temperature is only 1 µC below optimum? That's because lizards are cold-blooded, and a woman's lizard brain is telling her that she better get to a warm place quickly or her muscles will freeze up and her heart will stop beating.<br /><br />Have you noticed how a woman always seems to be thinking about two things at once? That's because a lizard's eyes point in two different directions, so it always has to process two completely different scenes.<br /><br />Have you noticed how two women can hate each other and have a serious fight, even if they don't know each other and they are sitting on opposite sides of the room? Lizards are very territorial and fight with each other by standing in one place and making threatening movements.<br /><br />Have you ever noticed how a woman drives? It's that two-direction eye problem again. That's why she thinks that it's possible to drive at high speed on a roundabout while looking in the mirror and adjusting her make-up.<br /><br />Have you noticed how a woman can sit somewhere completely happy, then suddenly out of nowhere she begins to cut you to pieces with her tongue? Well, just watch a lizard catch flies and you will know where that comes from.<br /><br />Women can lay in the sun on a big rock all day and never get bored.<br /><br />If a woman gets the chance, and she thinks that she can get away with it, she will color her hair orange and green and get it styled into a spiky hairdo. This is definitely a lizard haircut.<br /><br />I'm sure that there are hundreds of examples. The point is, the lizard brain theory explains everything. I am expecting to win the Nobel Prize this year.</div>

<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Hey,<br />This is a conversation between a father and a son...you will probably understand the reason why US attacked Iraq and how the world functions better after reading<br />this.<br /><br />Q: Daddy, why did we have to attack Iraq?<br />A: Because they had weapons of mass destruction,  honey.<br /><br />Q: But the inspectors didn't find any weapons of mass destruction.<br />A: That's because the Iraqis were hiding them.<br /><br />Q: And that's why we invaded Iraq?<br />A: Yep. Invasions always work better than  inspections.<br /><br />Q: But after we invaded them, we STILL didn't find any weapons  of mass destruction, did we?<br />A: That's because the weapons are so well hidden. Don't worry, we'll find something, probably right before the 2004 election.<br /><br />Q: Why did Iraq want all those weapons of mass  destruction?<br />A: To use them in a war, silly.<br /><br />Q: I'm confused. If they had all those weapons that they planned to use in a war, then why didn't they use any of those weapons when we  went to war with them?<br />A: Well, obviously they didn't want anyone to know they had  those weapons,so they chose to die by the thousands rather than defend themselves.<br /><br />Q: That doesn't make sense Daddy. Why would they choose to die  if they had all those big weapons to fight us back with?<br />A: It's a different culture. It's not supposed to make  sense.<br /><br />Q: I don't know about you, but I don't think they had any of those weapons our government said they did.<br />A: Well, you know, it doesn't matter whether or not they had those weapons. We had another good reason to invade them anyway.<br /><br />Q: And what was that?<br />A: Even if Iraq didn't have weapons of mass destruction, Saddam Hussein was a cruel dictator, which is another good reason to invade another country.<br /><br />Q: Why? What does a cruel dictator do that makes it OK to invade his country?<br />A: Well, for one thing, he tortured his own people.<br /><br />Q: Kind of like what they do in China?<br />A: Don't go comparing China to Iraq. China is a good economic competitor, where millions of people work for slave wages in sweatshops to make U.S. corporations richer.<br /><br />Q: So if a country lets its people be exploited for American corporate<br />gain, it's a good country, even if that country tortures people?<br />A: Right.<br /><br />Q: Why were people in Iraq being tortured?<br />A: For political crimes, mostly, like criticizing the  government. People who criticized the government in Iraq were sent to prison and tortured.<br /><br />Q: Isn't that exactly what happens in China?<br />A: I told you, China is different.<br /><br />Q: What's the difference between China and Iraq?<br />A: Well, for one thing, Iraq was ruled by the Ba'ath party, while China is Communist.<br /><br />Q: Didn't you once tell me Communists were bad?<br />A: No, just Cuban Communists are bad.<br /><br />Q: How are the Cuban Communists bad?<br />A: Well, for one thing, people who criticize the government in Cuba are sent to prison and tortured.<br /><br />Q: Like in Iraq?<br />A: Exactly.<br /><br />Q: And like in China, too?<br />A: I told you, China's a good economic competitor. Cuba, on the other hand, is not.<br /><br />Q: How come Cuba isn't a good economic competitor?<br />A: Well, you see, back in the early 1960s, our government passed some laws that made it illegal for Americans to trade or do any business with Cuba until they stopped being Communists and started being capitalists like us.<br /><br />Q: But if we got rid of those laws, opened up trade with Cuba,and started doing business with them, wouldn't that help the Cubans become capitalists?<br />A: Don't be a smart-ass.<br /><br />Q: I didn't think I was being one.<br />A: Well, anyway, they also don't have freedom of religion in Cuba.<br /><br />Q: Kind of like China and the @!#$ movement?<br />A: I told you, stop saying bad things about China. Anyway,  Saddam Hussein came to power through a military coup, so he's not really a legitimate leader anyway.<br /><br />Q: What's a military coup?<br />A: That's when a military general takes over the government of a country by force, instead of holding free elections like we do in the United States.<br /><br />Q: Didn't the ruler of Pakistan come to power by a military coup?<br />A: You mean General Pervez Musharraf? Uh, yeah, he did, but Pakistan is our friend.<br /><br />Q: Why is Pakistan our friend if their leader is illegitimate?<br />A: I never said Pervez Musharraf was illegitimate.<br /><br />Q: Didn't you just say a military general who comes to power by forcibly overthrowing the legitimate government of a nation is an illegitimate leader?<br />A: Only Saddam Hussein. Pervez Musharraf is our friend, because he helped us invade Afghanistan.<br /><br />Q: Why did we invade Afghanistan?<br />A: Because of what they did to us on September 11th.<br /><br />Q: What did Afghanistan do to us on September 11th?<br />A: Well, on September 11th, nineteen men, fifteen of them Saudi Arabians, hijacked four airplanes and flew three of them into buildings,killing over 3,000 Americans.<br /><br />Q: So how did Afghanistan figure into all that?<br />A: Afghanistan was where those bad men trained, under the oppressive rule of the Taliban.<br /><br />Q: Aren't the Taliban those bad radical Islamics who chopped off people's heads and hands?<br />A: Yes, that's exactly who they were. Not only did they chop off people's heads and hands, but they oppressed women, too.<br /><br />Q: Didn't the Bush administration giv e the Taliban 43 million dollars back in May of 2001?<br />A: Yes, but that money was a reward because they did such a good job fighting drugs.<br /><br />Q: Fighting drugs?<br />A: Yes, the Taliban were very helpful in stopping people from growing opium poppies.<br /><br />Q: How did they do such a good job?<br />A: Simple. If people were caught growing opium poppies, the Taliban would have their hands and heads cut off.<br /><br />Q: So, when the Taliban cut off people's heads and hands for growing flowers, that was OK, but not if they cut people's heads and hands off for other reasons?<br />A: Yes. It's OK with us if radical Islamic fundamentalists cut off people's hands for growing flowers, but it's cruel if they cut off people's hands for stealing bread.<br /><br />Q: Don't they also cut off people's hands and heads in Saudi Arabia?<br />A: That's different. Afghanistan was ruled by a tyrannical patriarchy that oppressed women and forced them to wear burqas whenever they  were in public, with death by stoning as the penalty for women who did not comply.<br /><br />Q: Don't Saudi women have to wear burqas in public,  too?<br />A: No, Saudi women merely wear a traditional Islamic body overing.<br /><br />Q: What's the difference?<br />A: The traditional Islamic co! vering worn by Saudi women is a modest yet fashionable garment that covers all of a woman's body xcept for her eyes and fingers. The burqa, on the other hand, is an evil tool of patriarchal oppression that covers all of a woman's body except for her eyes<br />and fingers.<br /><br />Q: It sounds like the same thing with a different  name.<br />A: Now, don't go comparing Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia. The Saudis are our friends.<br /><br />Q: But I thought you said 15 of the 19 hijackers on September 11th were from Saudi Arabia.<br />A: Yes, but they trained in Afghanistan.<br /><br />Q: Who trained them?<br />A: A very bad man named Osama bin Laden.<br /><br />Q: Was he from Afghanist! an?<br />A: Uh, no, he was from Saudi Arabia too. But he was a bad man, a very bad man.<br /><br />Q: I seem to recall he was our friend once.<br />A: Only when we helped him and the mujahadeen repel the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan back in the 1980s.<br /><br />Q: Who are the Soviets? Was that the Evil Communist Empire  Ronald Reagan talked about?<br />A: There are no more Soviets. The Soviet Union broke up in 1990 or there abouts, and now they have elections and capitalism like us. We call them Russians now.<br /><br />Q: So the Soviets, I mean, the Russians, are now our  friends?<br />A: Well, not really. You see, they were our friends for many years after they stopped being Soviets, bu t then they decided not to support our invasion of Iraq, so we're mad at them now. We're also mad at  the French and the Germans because they didn't help us invade Iraqe ither.<br /><br />Q: So the French and Germans are evil, too?<br />A: Not exactly evil, but just bad enough that we had to rename French fries and French toast to Freedom Fries and Freedom Toast.<br /><br />Q: Do we always rename foods whenever another country doesn't do what we want them to do?<br />A: No, we just do that to our friends. Our enemies, we  invade.<br /><br />Q: But wasn't Iraq one of our friends back in the  1980s?<br />A: Well, yeah. For a while.<br /><br />Q: Was Saddam Hussein ruler of Iraq back then?<br />A: Yes, but at the time he was fighting against Iran, which made him our friend, temporarily.<br /><br />Q: Why did that make him our friend?<br />A: Because at that time, Iran was our enemy.<br /><br />Q: Isn't that when he gassed the Kurds?<br />A: Yeah, but since he was fighting against Iran at the time, we looked the other way, to show him we were his friend.<br /><br />Q: So anyone who fights against one of our enemies automatically becomes our friend?<br />A: Most of the time, yes.<br /><br />Q: And anyone who fights against one of our friends is automatically an enemy?<br />A: Sometimes that's true, t! oo. However, if American corporations can profit by selling weapons to both sides at the same time, all  the better.<br /><br />Q: Why?<br />A: Because war is good for the economy, which meanswar is good for America. Also, since God is on America's side, anyone who opposes war is  a godless un-American Communist. Do you understand now why we attacked Iraq?<br /><br />Q: I think so. We attacked them because God wanted us to,r ight?<br />A: Yes.<br /><br />Q: But how did we know God wanted us to attack Iraq?<br />A: Well, you see, God personally speaks to George W. Bush and tells him what to do.<br /><br />Q: So basically, what you're saying is that we attacked Iraq because George W. Bush hears voices in his head?<br />A. Yes! You finally understand how the world works. Now close your eyes, make yourself comfortable, and go to sleep. Good night.<br /><br />Good night, Daddy.<br /></div></div>]]></body></post><post id="p13617" date="Posted: Sun Sep 28, 2003 6:00 am "><author>[sic]</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">That's great _shank.

It is Very difficult to positively identify the surface by just looking at it. So, how do we determine with any amount of certainty what type of mirror we are looking at? 
<br /><br />CONDUCT THIS SIMPLE TEST: Place the tip of your fingernail against the reflective surface and if there is a GAP between your fingernail and the image of the nail, then it is a GENUINE mirror. However, if your fingernail DIRECTLY TOUCHES the image of your nail, then BEWARE, IT IS A 2-WAY MIRROR! (there is someone seeing you from the other side).  The reason there is a gap on a real mirror, is because the silver is on the back of the mirror UNDER the glass. Whereas with a two-way mirror, the silver is on the surface. Keep it in mind! Make sure and check every time you enter in hotel rooms. May be someone is making a film on you.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p15645" date="Posted: Fri Nov 21, 2003 8:01 am "><author>Rayne</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">So basically, what you're saying is that we attacked Iraq because George W.

  <div class="quotecontent">The lizard brain<br /><br />Maybe you remember way back in school when you learned that the human brain still contains a prehistoric lizard brain at its center. This is the key to understanding women and what you can expect from them.<br /><br />Women still have direct contact with the lizard brain, something which men have been able to shut down about a trillion centuries ago.<br /><br />Have you ever noticed how women get cold very easily even if the temperature is only 1 µC below optimum? That's because lizards are cold-blooded, and a woman's lizard brain is telling her that she better get to a warm place quickly or her muscles will freeze up and her heart will stop beating.<br /><br />Have you noticed how a woman always seems to be thinking about two things at once? That's because a lizard's eyes point in two different directions, so it always has to process two completely different scenes.<br /><br />Have you noticed how two women can hate each other and have a serious fight, even if they don't know each other and they are sitting on opposite sides of the room? Lizards are very territorial and fight with each other by standing in one place and making threatening movements.<br /><br />Have you ever noticed how a woman drives? It's that two-direction eye problem again. That's why she thinks that it's possible to drive at high speed on a roundabout while looking in the mirror and adjusting her make-up.<br /><br />Have you noticed how a woman can sit somewhere completely happy, then suddenly out of nowhere she begins to cut you to pieces with her tongue? Well, just watch a lizard catch flies and you will know where that comes from.<br /><br />Women can lay in the sun on a big rock all day and never get bored.<br /><br />If a woman gets the chance, and she thinks that she can get away with it, she will color her hair orange and green and get it styled into a spiky hairdo. This is definitely a lizard haircut.<br /><br />I'm sure that there are hundreds of examples. The point is, the lizard brain theory explains everything. I am expecting to win the Nobel Prize this year.</div>

<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Hey,<br />This is a conversation between a father and a son...you will probably understand the reason why US attacked Iraq and how the world functions better after reading<br />this.<br /><br />Q: Daddy, why did we have to attack Iraq?<br />A: Because they had weapons of mass destruction,  honey.<br /><br />Q: But the inspectors didn't find any weapons of mass destruction.<br />A: That's because the Iraqis were hiding them.<br /><br />Q: And that's why we invaded Iraq?<br />A: Yep. Invasions always work better than  inspections.<br /><br />Q: But after we invaded them, we STILL didn't find any weapons  of mass destruction, did we?<br />A: That's because the weapons are so well hidden. Don't worry, we'll find something, probably right before the 2004 election.<br /><br />Q: Why did Iraq want all those weapons of mass  destruction?<br />A: To use them in a war, silly.<br /><br />Q: I'm confused. If they had all those weapons that they planned to use in a war, then why didn't they use any of those weapons when we  went to war with them?<br />A: Well, obviously they didn't want anyone to know they had  those weapons,so they chose to die by the thousands rather than defend themselves.<br /><br />Q: That doesn't make sense Daddy. Why would they choose to die  if they had all those big weapons to fight us back with?<br />A: It's a different culture. It's not supposed to make  sense.<br /><br />Q: I don't know about you, but I don't think they had any of those weapons our government said they did.<br />A: Well, you know, it doesn't matter whether or not they had those weapons. We had another good reason to invade them anyway.<br /><br />Q: And what was that?<br />A: Even if Iraq didn't have weapons of mass destruction, Saddam Hussein was a cruel dictator, which is another good reason to invade another country.<br /><br />Q: Why? What does a cruel dictator do that makes it OK to invade his country?<br />A: Well, for one thing, he tortured his own people.<br /><br />Q: Kind of like what they do in China?<br />A: Don't go comparing China to Iraq. China is a good economic competitor, where millions of people work for slave wages in sweatshops to make U.S. corporations richer.<br /><br />Q: So if a country lets its people be exploited for American corporate<br />gain, it's a good country, even if that country tortures people?<br />A: Right.<br /><br />Q: Why were people in Iraq being tortured?<br />A: For political crimes, mostly, like criticizing the  government. People who criticized the government in Iraq were sent to prison and tortured.<br /><br />Q: Isn't that exactly what happens in China?<br />A: I told you, China is different.<br /><br />Q: What's the difference between China and Iraq?<br />A: Well, for one thing, Iraq was ruled by the Ba'ath party, while China is Communist.<br /><br />Q: Didn't you once tell me Communists were bad?<br />A: No, just Cuban Communists are bad.<br /><br />Q: How are the Cuban Communists bad?<br />A: Well, for one thing, people who criticize the government in Cuba are sent to prison and tortured.<br /><br />Q: Like in Iraq?<br />A: Exactly.<br /><br />Q: And like in China, too?<br />A: I told you, China's a good economic competitor. Cuba, on the other hand, is not.<br /><br />Q: How come Cuba isn't a good economic competitor?<br />A: Well, you see, back in the early 1960s, our government passed some laws that made it illegal for Americans to trade or do any business with Cuba until they stopped being Communists and started being capitalists like us.<br /><br />Q: But if we got rid of those laws, opened up trade with Cuba,and started doing business with them, wouldn't that help the Cubans become capitalists?<br />A: Don't be a smart-ass.<br /><br />Q: I didn't think I was being one.<br />A: Well, anyway, they also don't have freedom of religion in Cuba.<br /><br />Q: Kind of like China and the @!#$ movement?<br />A: I told you, stop saying bad things about China. Anyway,  Saddam Hussein came to power through a military coup, so he's not really a legitimate leader anyway.<br /><br />Q: What's a military coup?<br />A: That's when a military general takes over the government of a country by force, instead of holding free elections like we do in the United States.<br /><br />Q: Didn't the ruler of Pakistan come to power by a military coup?<br />A: You mean General Pervez Musharraf? Uh, yeah, he did, but Pakistan is our friend.<br /><br />Q: Why is Pakistan our friend if their leader is illegitimate?<br />A: I never said Pervez Musharraf was illegitimate.<br /><br />Q: Didn't you just say a military general who comes to power by forcibly overthrowing the legitimate government of a nation is an illegitimate leader?<br />A: Only Saddam Hussein. Pervez Musharraf is our friend, because he helped us invade Afghanistan.<br /><br />Q: Why did we invade Afghanistan?<br />A: Because of what they did to us on September 11th.<br /><br />Q: What did Afghanistan do to us on September 11th?<br />A: Well, on September 11th, nineteen men, fifteen of them Saudi Arabians, hijacked four airplanes and flew three of them into buildings,killing over 3,000 Americans.<br /><br />Q: So how did Afghanistan figure into all that?<br />A: Afghanistan was where those bad men trained, under the oppressive rule of the Taliban.<br /><br />Q: Aren't the Taliban those bad radical Islamics who chopped off people's heads and hands?<br />A: Yes, that's exactly who they were. Not only did they chop off people's heads and hands, but they oppressed women, too.<br /><br />Q: Didn't the Bush administration giv e the Taliban 43 million dollars back in May of 2001?<br />A: Yes, but that money was a reward because they did such a good job fighting drugs.<br /><br />Q: Fighting drugs?<br />A: Yes, the Taliban were very helpful in stopping people from growing opium poppies.<br /><br />Q: How did they do such a good job?<br />A: Simple. If people were caught growing opium poppies, the Taliban would have their hands and heads cut off.<br /><br />Q: So, when the Taliban cut off people's heads and hands for growing flowers, that was OK, but not if they cut people's heads and hands off for other reasons?<br />A: Yes. It's OK with us if radical Islamic fundamentalists cut off people's hands for growing flowers, but it's cruel if they cut off people's hands for stealing bread.<br /><br />Q: Don't they also cut off people's hands and heads in Saudi Arabia?<br />A: That's different. Afghanistan was ruled by a tyrannical patriarchy that oppressed women and forced them to wear burqas whenever they  were in public, with death by stoning as the penalty for women who did not comply.<br /><br />Q: Don't Saudi women have to wear burqas in public,  too?<br />A: No, Saudi women merely wear a traditional Islamic body overing.<br /><br />Q: What's the difference?<br />A: The traditional Islamic co! vering worn by Saudi women is a modest yet fashionable garment that covers all of a woman's body xcept for her eyes and fingers. The burqa, on the other hand, is an evil tool of patriarchal oppression that covers all of a woman's body except for her eyes<br />and fingers.<br /><br />Q: It sounds like the same thing with a different  name.<br />A: Now, don't go comparing Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia. The Saudis are our friends.<br /><br />Q: But I thought you said 15 of the 19 hijackers on September 11th were from Saudi Arabia.<br />A: Yes, but they trained in Afghanistan.<br /><br />Q: Who trained them?<br />A: A very bad man named Osama bin Laden.<br /><br />Q: Was he from Afghanist! an?<br />A: Uh, no, he was from Saudi Arabia too. But he was a bad man, a very bad man.<br /><br />Q: I seem to recall he was our friend once.<br />A: Only when we helped him and the mujahadeen repel the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan back in the 1980s.<br /><br />Q: Who are the Soviets? Was that the Evil Communist Empire  Ronald Reagan talked about?<br />A: There are no more Soviets. The Soviet Union broke up in 1990 or there abouts, and now they have elections and capitalism like us. We call them Russians now.<br /><br />Q: So the Soviets, I mean, the Russians, are now our  friends?<br />A: Well, not really. You see, they were our friends for many years after they stopped being Soviets, bu t then they decided not to support our invasion of Iraq, so we're mad at them now. We're also mad at  the French and the Germans because they didn't help us invade Iraqe ither.<br /><br />Q: So the French and Germans are evil, too?<br />A: Not exactly evil, but just bad enough that we had to rename French fries and French toast to Freedom Fries and Freedom Toast.<br /><br />Q: Do we always rename foods whenever another country doesn't do what we want them to do?<br />A: No, we just do that to our friends. Our enemies, we  invade.<br /><br />Q: But wasn't Iraq one of our friends back in the  1980s?<br />A: Well, yeah. For a while.<br /><br />Q: Was Saddam Hussein ruler of Iraq back then?<br />A: Yes, but at the time he was fighting against Iran, which made him our friend, temporarily.<br /><br />Q: Why did that make him our friend?<br />A: Because at that time, Iran was our enemy.<br /><br />Q: Isn't that when he gassed the Kurds?<br />A: Yeah, but since he was fighting against Iran at the time, we looked the other way, to show him we were his friend.<br /><br />Q: So anyone who fights against one of our enemies automatically becomes our friend?<br />A: Most of the time, yes.<br /><br />Q: And anyone who fights against one of our friends is automatically an enemy?<br />A: Sometimes that's true, t! oo. However, if American corporations can profit by selling weapons to both sides at the same time, all  the better.<br /><br />Q: Why?<br />A: Because war is good for the economy, which meanswar is good for America. Also, since God is on America's side, anyone who opposes war is  a godless un-American Communist. Do you understand now why we attacked Iraq?<br /><br />Q: I think so. We attacked them because God wanted us to,r ight?<br />A: Yes.<br /><br />Q: But how did we know God wanted us to attack Iraq?<br />A: Well, you see, God personally speaks to George W. Bush and tells him what to do.<br /><br />Q: So basically, what you're saying is that we attacked Iraq because George W. Bush hears voices in his head?<br />A. Yes! You finally understand how the world works. Now close your eyes, make yourself comfortable, and go to sleep. Good night.<br /><br />Good night, Daddy.<br /></div></div>]]></body></post><post id="p13617" date="Posted: Sun Sep 28, 2003 6:00 am "><author>[sic]</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">That's great _shank.

It is Very difficult to positively identify the surface by just looking at it. So, how do we determine with any amount of certainty what type of mirror we are looking at? 
<br /><br />CONDUCT THIS SIMPLE TEST: Place the tip of your fingernail against the reflective surface and if there is a GAP between your fingernail and the image of the nail, then it is a GENUINE mirror. However, if your fingernail DIRECTLY TOUCHES the image of your nail, then BEWARE, IT IS A 2-WAY MIRROR! (there is someone seeing you from the other side).  The reason there is a gap on a real mirror, is because the silver is on the back of the mirror UNDER the glass. Whereas with a two-way mirror, the silver is on the surface. Keep it in mind! Make sure and check every time you enter in hotel rooms. May be someone is making a film on you.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p15645" date="Posted: Fri Nov 21, 2003 8:01 am "><author>Rayne</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">So basically, what you're saying is that we attacked Iraq because George W.

  <div class="quotecontent">The lizard brain<br /><br />Maybe you remember way back in school when you learned that the human brain still contains a prehistoric lizard brain at its center. This is the key to understanding women and what you can expect from them.<br /><br />Women still have direct contact with the lizard brain, something which men have been able to shut down about a trillion centuries ago.<br /><br />Have you ever noticed how women get cold very easily even if the temperature is only 1 µC below optimum? That's because lizards are cold-blooded, and a woman's lizard brain is telling her that she better get to a warm place quickly or her muscles will freeze up and her heart will stop beating.<br /><br />Have you noticed how a woman always seems to be thinking about two things at once? That's because a lizard's eyes point in two different directions, so it always has to process two completely different scenes.<br /><br />Have you noticed how two women can hate each other and have a serious fight, even if they don't know each other and they are sitting on opposite sides of the room? Lizards are very territorial and fight with each other by standing in one place and making threatening movements.<br /><br />Have you ever noticed how a woman drives? It's that two-direction eye problem again. That's why she thinks that it's possible to drive at high speed on a roundabout while looking in the mirror and adjusting her make-up.<br /><br />Have you noticed how a woman can sit somewhere completely happy, then suddenly out of nowhere she begins to cut you to pieces with her tongue? Well, just watch a lizard catch flies and you will know where that comes from.<br /><br />Women can lay in the sun on a big rock all day and never get bored.<br /><br />If a woman gets the chance, and she thinks that she can get away with it, she will color her hair orange and green and get it styled into a spiky hairdo. This is definitely a lizard haircut.<br /><br />I'm sure that there are hundreds of examples. The point is, the lizard brain theory explains everything. I am expecting to win the Nobel Prize this year.</div>

<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Hey,<br />This is a conversation between a father and a son...you will probably understand the reason why US attacked Iraq and how the world functions better after reading<br />this.<br /><br />Q: Daddy, why did we have to attack Iraq?<br />A: Because they had weapons of mass destruction,  honey.<br /><br />Q: But the inspectors didn't find any weapons of mass destruction.<br />A: That's because the Iraqis were hiding them.<br /><br />Q: And that's why we invaded Iraq?<br />A: Yep. Invasions always work better than  inspections.<br /><br />Q: But after we invaded them, we STILL didn't find any weapons  of mass destruction, did we?<br />A: That's because the weapons are so well hidden. Don't worry, we'll find something, probably right before the 2004 election.<br /><br />Q: Why did Iraq want all those weapons of mass  destruction?<br />A: To use them in a war, silly.<br /><br />Q: I'm confused. If they had all those weapons that they planned to use in a war, then why didn't they use any of those weapons when we  went to war with them?<br />A: Well, obviously they didn't want anyone to know they had  those weapons,so they chose to die by the thousands rather than defend themselves.<br /><br />Q: That doesn't make sense Daddy. Why would they choose to die  if they had all those big weapons to fight us back with?<br />A: It's a different culture. It's not supposed to make  sense.<br /><br />Q: I don't know about you, but I don't think they had any of those weapons our government said they did.<br />A: Well, you know, it doesn't matter whether or not they had those weapons. We had another good reason to invade them anyway.<br /><br />Q: And what was that?<br />A: Even if Iraq didn't have weapons of mass destruction, Saddam Hussein was a cruel dictator, which is another good reason to invade another country.<br /><br />Q: Why? What does a cruel dictator do that makes it OK to invade his country?<br />A: Well, for one thing, he tortured his own people.<br /><br />Q: Kind of like what they do in China?<br />A: Don't go comparing China to Iraq. China is a good economic competitor, where millions of people work for slave wages in sweatshops to make U.S. corporations richer.<br /><br />Q: So if a country lets its people be exploited for American corporate<br />gain, it's a good country, even if that country tortures people?<br />A: Right.<br /><br />Q: Why were people in Iraq being tortured?<br />A: For political crimes, mostly, like criticizing the  government. People who criticized the government in Iraq were sent to prison and tortured.<br /><br />Q: Isn't that exactly what happens in China?<br />A: I told you, China is different.<br /><br />Q: What's the difference between China and Iraq?<br />A: Well, for one thing, Iraq was ruled by the Ba'ath party, while China is Communist.<br /><br />Q: Didn't you once tell me Communists were bad?<br />A: No, just Cuban Communists are bad.<br /><br />Q: How are the Cuban Communists bad?<br />A: Well, for one thing, people who criticize the government in Cuba are sent to prison and tortured.<br /><br />Q: Like in Iraq?<br />A: Exactly.<br /><br />Q: And like in China, too?<br />A: I told you, China's a good economic competitor. Cuba, on the other hand, is not.<br /><br />Q: How come Cuba isn't a good economic competitor?<br />A: Well, you see, back in the early 1960s, our government passed some laws that made it illegal for Americans to trade or do any business with Cuba until they stopped being Communists and started being capitalists like us.<br /><br />Q: But if we got rid of those laws, opened up trade with Cuba,and started doing business with them, wouldn't that help the Cubans become capitalists?<br />A: Don't be a smart-ass.<br /><br />Q: I didn't think I was being one.<br />A: Well, anyway, they also don't have freedom of religion in Cuba.<br /><br />Q: Kind of like China and the @!#$ movement?<br />A: I told you, stop saying bad things about China. Anyway,  Saddam Hussein came to power through a military coup, so he's not really a legitimate leader anyway.<br /><br />Q: What's a military coup?<br />A: That's when a military general takes over the government of a country by force, instead of holding free elections like we do in the United States.<br /><br />Q: Didn't the ruler of Pakistan come to power by a military coup?<br />A: You mean General Pervez Musharraf? Uh, yeah, he did, but Pakistan is our friend.<br /><br />Q: Why is Pakistan our friend if their leader is illegitimate?<br />A: I never said Pervez Musharraf was illegitimate.<br /><br />Q: Didn't you just say a military general who comes to power by forcibly overthrowing the legitimate government of a nation is an illegitimate leader?<br />A: Only Saddam Hussein. Pervez Musharraf is our friend, because he helped us invade Afghanistan.<br /><br />Q: Why did we invade Afghanistan?<br />A: Because of what they did to us on September 11th.<br /><br />Q: What did Afghanistan do to us on September 11th?<br />A: Well, on September 11th, nineteen men, fifteen of them Saudi Arabians, hijacked four airplanes and flew three of them into buildings,killing over 3,000 Americans.<br /><br />Q: So how did Afghanistan figure into all that?<br />A: Afghanistan was where those bad men trained, under the oppressive rule of the Taliban.<br /><br />Q: Aren't the Taliban those bad radical Islamics who chopped off people's heads and hands?<br />A: Yes, that's exactly who they were. Not only did they chop off people's heads and hands, but they oppressed women, too.<br /><br />Q: Didn't the Bush administration giv e the Taliban 43 million dollars back in May of 2001?<br />A: Yes, but that money was a reward because they did such a good job fighting drugs.<br /><br />Q: Fighting drugs?<br />A: Yes, the Taliban were very helpful in stopping people from growing opium poppies.<br /><br />Q: How did they do such a good job?<br />A: Simple. If people were caught growing opium poppies, the Taliban would have their hands and heads cut off.<br /><br />Q: So, when the Taliban cut off people's heads and hands for growing flowers, that was OK, but not if they cut people's heads and hands off for other reasons?<br />A: Yes. It's OK with us if radical Islamic fundamentalists cut off people's hands for growing flowers, but it's cruel if they cut off people's hands for stealing bread.<br /><br />Q: Don't they also cut off people's hands and heads in Saudi Arabia?<br />A: That's different. Afghanistan was ruled by a tyrannical patriarchy that oppressed women and forced them to wear burqas whenever they  were in public, with death by stoning as the penalty for women who did not comply.<br /><br />Q: Don't Saudi women have to wear burqas in public,  too?<br />A: No, Saudi women merely wear a traditional Islamic body overing.<br /><br />Q: What's the difference?<br />A: The traditional Islamic co! vering worn by Saudi women is a modest yet fashionable garment that covers all of a woman's body xcept for her eyes and fingers. The burqa, on the other hand, is an evil tool of patriarchal oppression that covers all of a woman's body except for her eyes<br />and fingers.<br /><br />Q: It sounds like the same thing with a different  name.<br />A: Now, don't go comparing Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia. The Saudis are our friends.<br /><br />Q: But I thought you said 15 of the 19 hijackers on September 11th were from Saudi Arabia.<br />A: Yes, but they trained in Afghanistan.<br /><br />Q: Who trained them?<br />A: A very bad man named Osama bin Laden.<br /><br />Q: Was he from Afghanist! an?<br />A: Uh, no, he was from Saudi Arabia too. But he was a bad man, a very bad man.<br /><br />Q: I seem to recall he was our friend once.<br />A: Only when we helped him and the mujahadeen repel the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan back in the 1980s.<br /><br />Q: Who are the Soviets? Was that the Evil Communist Empire  Ronald Reagan talked about?<br />A: There are no more Soviets. The Soviet Union broke up in 1990 or there abouts, and now they have elections and capitalism like us. We call them Russians now.<br /><br />Q: So the Soviets, I mean, the Russians, are now our  friends?<br />A: Well, not really. You see, they were our friends for many years after they stopped being Soviets, bu t then they decided not to support our invasion of Iraq, so we're mad at them now. We're also mad at  the French and the Germans because they didn't help us invade Iraqe ither.<br /><br />Q: So the French and Germans are evil, too?<br />A: Not exactly evil, but just bad enough that we had to rename French fries and French toast to Freedom Fries and Freedom Toast.<br /><br />Q: Do we always rename foods whenever another country doesn't do what we want them to do?<br />A: No, we just do that to our friends. Our enemies, we  invade.<br /><br />Q: But wasn't Iraq one of our friends back in the  1980s?<br />A: Well, yeah. For a while.<br /><br />Q: Was Saddam Hussein ruler of Iraq back then?<br />A: Yes, but at the time he was fighting against Iran, which made him our friend, temporarily.<br /><br />Q: Why did that make him our friend?<br />A: Because at that time, Iran was our enemy.<br /><br />Q: Isn't that when he gassed the Kurds?<br />A: Yeah, but since he was fighting against Iran at the time, we looked the other way, to show him we were his friend.<br /><br />Q: So anyone who fights against one of our enemies automatically becomes our friend?<br />A: Most of the time, yes.<br /><br />Q: And anyone who fights against one of our friends is automatically an enemy?<br />A: Sometimes that's true, t! oo. However, if American corporations can profit by selling weapons to both sides at the same time, all  the better.<br /><br />Q: Why?<br />A: Because war is good for the economy, which meanswar is good for America. Also, since God is on America's side, anyone who opposes war is  a godless un-American Communist. Do you understand now why we attacked Iraq?<br /><br />Q: I think so. We attacked them because God wanted us to,r ight?<br />A: Yes.<br /><br />Q: But how did we know God wanted us to attack Iraq?<br />A: Well, you see, God personally speaks to George W. Bush and tells him what to do.<br /><br />Q: So basically, what you're saying is that we attacked Iraq because George W. Bush hears voices in his head?<br />A. Yes! You finally understand how the world works. Now close your eyes, make yourself comfortable, and go to sleep. Good night.<br /><br />Good night, Daddy.<br /></div></div>]]></body></post><post id="p13617" date="Posted: Sun Sep 28, 2003 6:00 am "><author>[sic]</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">That's great _shank.

It is Very difficult to positively identify the surface by just looking at it. So, how do we determine with any amount of certainty what type of mirror we are looking at? 
<br /><br />CONDUCT THIS SIMPLE TEST: Place the tip of your fingernail against the reflective surface and if there is a GAP between your fingernail and the image of the nail, then it is a GENUINE mirror. However, if your fingernail DIRECTLY TOUCHES the image of your nail, then BEWARE, IT IS A 2-WAY MIRROR! (there is someone seeing you from the other side).  The reason there is a gap on a real mirror, is because the silver is on the back of the mirror UNDER the glass. Whereas with a two-way mirror, the silver is on the surface. Keep it in mind! Make sure and check every time you enter in hotel rooms. May be someone is making a film on you.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p15645" date="Posted: Fri Nov 21, 2003 8:01 am "><author>Rayne</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">So basically, what you're saying is that we attacked Iraq because George W.

  <div class="quotecontent">The lizard brain<br /><br />Maybe you remember way back in school when you learned that the human brain still contains a prehistoric lizard brain at its center. This is the key to understanding women and what you can expect from them.<br /><br />Women still have direct contact with the lizard brain, something which men have been able to shut down about a trillion centuries ago.<br /><br />Have you ever noticed how women get cold very easily even if the temperature is only 1 µC below optimum? That's because lizards are cold-blooded, and a woman's lizard brain is telling her that she better get to a warm place quickly or her muscles will freeze up and her heart will stop beating.<br /><br />Have you noticed how a woman always seems to be thinking about two things at once? That's because a lizard's eyes point in two different directions, so it always has to process two completely different scenes.<br /><br />Have you noticed how two women can hate each other and have a serious fight, even if they don't know each other and they are sitting on opposite sides of the room? Lizards are very territorial and fight with each other by standing in one place and making threatening movements.<br /><br />Have you ever noticed how a woman drives? It's that two-direction eye problem again. That's why she thinks that it's possible to drive at high speed on a roundabout while looking in the mirror and adjusting her make-up.<br /><br />Have you noticed how a woman can sit somewhere completely happy, then suddenly out of nowhere she begins to cut you to pieces with her tongue? Well, just watch a lizard catch flies and you will know where that comes from.<br /><br />Women can lay in the sun on a big rock all day and never get bored.<br /><br />If a woman gets the chance, and she thinks that she can get away with it, she will color her hair orange and green and get it styled into a spiky hairdo. This is definitely a lizard haircut.<br /><br />I'm sure that there are hundreds of examples. The point is, the lizard brain theory explains everything. I am expecting to win the Nobel Prize this year.</div>

And anal is definitely the fast track to the "in" crowd: Ever since I started taking it anal, I've been way popular at school!<br /><br /><br />JEREMY T., Holyoke, MA<br />I have to admit, when I first suggested anal sex to my girlfriend, she looked at me like I was crazy. I offered to double-wrap, use plenty of AstroGlide, but she was still totally freaked over the idea of it. Then she made a deal with me: If I'd bend over for her strap-on, she'd bend over for me. We take turns taking it up the poop chute, and now we finally feel like our relationship is fully equal.</div>

<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Hey,<br />This is a conversation between a father and a son...you will probably understand the reason why US attacked Iraq and how the world functions better after reading<br />this.<br /><br />Q: Daddy, why did we have to attack Iraq?<br />A: Because they had weapons of mass destruction,  honey.<br /><br />Q: But the inspectors didn't find any weapons of mass destruction.<br />A: That's because the Iraqis were hiding them.<br /><br />Q: And that's why we invaded Iraq?<br />A: Yep. Invasions always work better than  inspections.<br /><br />Q: But after we invaded them, we STILL didn't find any weapons  of mass destruction, did we?<br />A: That's because the weapons are so well hidden. Don't worry, we'll find something, probably right before the 2004 election.<br /><br />Q: Why did Iraq want all those weapons of mass  destruction?<br />A: To use them in a war, silly.<br /><br />Q: I'm confused. If they had all those weapons that they planned to use in a war, then why didn't they use any of those weapons when we  went to war with them?<br />A: Well, obviously they didn't want anyone to know they had  those weapons,so they chose to die by the thousands rather than defend themselves.<br /><br />Q: That doesn't make sense Daddy. Why would they choose to die  if they had all those big weapons to fight us back with?<br />A: It's a different culture. It's not supposed to make  sense.<br /><br />Q: I don't know about you, but I don't think they had any of those weapons our government said they did.<br />A: Well, you know, it doesn't matter whether or not they had those weapons. We had another good reason to invade them anyway.<br /><br />Q: And what was that?<br />A: Even if Iraq didn't have weapons of mass destruction, Saddam Hussein was a cruel dictator, which is another good reason to invade another country.<br /><br />Q: Why? What does a cruel dictator do that makes it OK to invade his country?<br />A: Well, for one thing, he tortured his own people.<br /><br />Q: Kind of like what they do in China?<br />A: Don't go comparing China to Iraq. China is a good economic competitor, where millions of people work for slave wages in sweatshops to make U.S. corporations richer.<br /><br />Q: So if a country lets its people be exploited for American corporate<br />gain, it's a good country, even if that country tortures people?<br />A: Right.<br /><br />Q: Why were people in Iraq being tortured?<br />A: For political crimes, mostly, like criticizing the  government. People who criticized the government in Iraq were sent to prison and tortured.<br /><br />Q: Isn't that exactly what happens in China?<br />A: I told you, China is different.<br /><br />Q: What's the difference between China and Iraq?<br />A: Well, for one thing, Iraq was ruled by the Ba'ath party, while China is Communist.<br /><br />Q: Didn't you once tell me Communists were bad?<br />A: No, just Cuban Communists are bad.<br /><br />Q: How are the Cuban Communists bad?<br />A: Well, for one thing, people who criticize the government in Cuba are sent to prison and tortured.<br /><br />Q: Like in Iraq?<br />A: Exactly.<br /><br />Q: And like in China, too?<br />A: I told you, China's a good economic competitor. Cuba, on the other hand, is not.<br /><br />Q: How come Cuba isn't a good economic competitor?<br />A: Well, you see, back in the early 1960s, our government passed some laws that made it illegal for Americans to trade or do any business with Cuba until they stopped being Communists and started being capitalists like us.<br /><br />Q: But if we got rid of those laws, opened up trade with Cuba,and started doing business with them, wouldn't that help the Cubans become capitalists?<br />A: Don't be a smart-ass.<br /><br />Q: I didn't think I was being one.<br />A: Well, anyway, they also don't have freedom of religion in Cuba.<br /><br />Q: Kind of like China and the @!#$ movement?<br />A: I told you, stop saying bad things about China. Anyway,  Saddam Hussein came to power through a military coup, so he's not really a legitimate leader anyway.<br /><br />Q: What's a military coup?<br />A: That's when a military general takes over the government of a country by force, instead of holding free elections like we do in the United States.<br /><br />Q: Didn't the ruler of Pakistan come to power by a military coup?<br />A: You mean General Pervez Musharraf? Uh, yeah, he did, but Pakistan is our friend.<br /><br />Q: Why is Pakistan our friend if their leader is illegitimate?<br />A: I never said Pervez Musharraf was illegitimate.<br /><br />Q: Didn't you just say a military general who comes to power by forcibly overthrowing the legitimate government of a nation is an illegitimate leader?<br />A: Only Saddam Hussein. Pervez Musharraf is our friend, because he helped us invade Afghanistan.<br /><br />Q: Why did we invade Afghanistan?<br />A: Because of what they did to us on September 11th.<br /><br />Q: What did Afghanistan do to us on September 11th?<br />A: Well, on September 11th, nineteen men, fifteen of them Saudi Arabians, hijacked four airplanes and flew three of them into buildings,killing over 3,000 Americans.<br /><br />Q: So how did Afghanistan figure into all that?<br />A: Afghanistan was where those bad men trained, under the oppressive rule of the Taliban.<br /><br />Q: Aren't the Taliban those bad radical Islamics who chopped off people's heads and hands?<br />A: Yes, that's exactly who they were. Not only did they chop off people's heads and hands, but they oppressed women, too.<br /><br />Q: Didn't the Bush administration giv e the Taliban 43 million dollars back in May of 2001?<br />A: Yes, but that money was a reward because they did such a good job fighting drugs.<br /><br />Q: Fighting drugs?<br />A: Yes, the Taliban were very helpful in stopping people from growing opium poppies.<br /><br />Q: How did they do such a good job?<br />A: Simple. If people were caught growing opium poppies, the Taliban would have their hands and heads cut off.<br /><br />Q: So, when the Taliban cut off people's heads and hands for growing flowers, that was OK, but not if they cut people's heads and hands off for other reasons?<br />A: Yes. It's OK with us if radical Islamic fundamentalists cut off people's hands for growing flowers, but it's cruel if they cut off people's hands for stealing bread.<br /><br />Q: Don't they also cut off people's hands and heads in Saudi Arabia?<br />A: That's different. Afghanistan was ruled by a tyrannical patriarchy that oppressed women and forced them to wear burqas whenever they  were in public, with death by stoning as the penalty for women who did not comply.<br /><br />Q: Don't Saudi women have to wear burqas in public,  too?<br />A: No, Saudi women merely wear a traditional Islamic body overing.<br /><br />Q: What's the difference?<br />A: The traditional Islamic co! vering worn by Saudi women is a modest yet fashionable garment that covers all of a woman's body xcept for her eyes and fingers. The burqa, on the other hand, is an evil tool of patriarchal oppression that covers all of a woman's body except for her eyes<br />and fingers.<br /><br />Q: It sounds like the same thing with a different  name.<br />A: Now, don't go comparing Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia. The Saudis are our friends.<br /><br />Q: But I thought you said 15 of the 19 hijackers on September 11th were from Saudi Arabia.<br />A: Yes, but they trained in Afghanistan.<br /><br />Q: Who trained them?<br />A: A very bad man named Osama bin Laden.<br /><br />Q: Was he from Afghanist! an?<br />A: Uh, no, he was from Saudi Arabia too. But he was a bad man, a very bad man.<br /><br />Q: I seem to recall he was our friend once.<br />A: Only when we helped him and the mujahadeen repel the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan back in the 1980s.<br /><br />Q: Who are the Soviets? Was that the Evil Communist Empire  Ronald Reagan talked about?<br />A: There are no more Soviets. The Soviet Union broke up in 1990 or there abouts, and now they have elections and capitalism like us. We call them Russians now.<br /><br />Q: So the Soviets, I mean, the Russians, are now our  friends?<br />A: Well, not really. You see, they were our friends for many years after they stopped being Soviets, bu t then they decided not to support our invasion of Iraq, so we're mad at them now. We're also mad at  the French and the Germans because they didn't help us invade Iraqe ither.<br /><br />Q: So the French and Germans are evil, too?<br />A: Not exactly evil, but just bad enough that we had to rename French fries and French toast to Freedom Fries and Freedom Toast.<br /><br />Q: Do we always rename foods whenever another country doesn't do what we want them to do?<br />A: No, we just do that to our friends. Our enemies, we  invade.<br /><br />Q: But wasn't Iraq one of our friends back in the  1980s?<br />A: Well, yeah. For a while.<br /><br />Q: Was Saddam Hussein ruler of Iraq back then?<br />A: Yes, but at the time he was fighting against Iran, which made him our friend, temporarily.<br /><br />Q: Why did that make him our friend?<br />A: Because at that time, Iran was our enemy.<br /><br />Q: Isn't that when he gassed the Kurds?<br />A: Yeah, but since he was fighting against Iran at the time, we looked the other way, to show him we were his friend.<br /><br />Q: So anyone who fights against one of our enemies automatically becomes our friend?<br />A: Most of the time, yes.<br /><br />Q: And anyone who fights against one of our friends is automatically an enemy?<br />A: Sometimes that's true, t! oo. However, if American corporations can profit by selling weapons to both sides at the same time, all  the better.<br /><br />Q: Why?<br />A: Because war is good for the economy, which meanswar is good for America. Also, since God is on America's side, anyone who opposes war is  a godless un-American Communist. Do you understand now why we attacked Iraq?<br /><br />Q: I think so. We attacked them because God wanted us to,r ight?<br />A: Yes.<br /><br />Q: But how did we know God wanted us to attack Iraq?<br />A: Well, you see, God personally speaks to George W. Bush and tells him what to do.<br /><br />Q: So basically, what you're saying is that we attacked Iraq because George W. Bush hears voices in his head?<br />A. Yes! You finally understand how the world works. Now close your eyes, make yourself comfortable, and go to sleep. Good night.<br /><br />Good night, Daddy.<br /></div></div>]]></body></post><post id="p13617" date="Posted: Sun Sep 28, 2003 6:00 am "><author>[sic]</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">That's great _shank.

It is Very difficult to positively identify the surface by just looking at it. So, how do we determine with any amount of certainty what type of mirror we are looking at? 
<br /><br />CONDUCT THIS SIMPLE TEST: Place the tip of your fingernail against the reflective surface and if there is a GAP between your fingernail and the image of the nail, then it is a GENUINE mirror. However, if your fingernail DIRECTLY TOUCHES the image of your nail, then BEWARE, IT IS A 2-WAY MIRROR! (there is someone seeing you from the other side).  The reason there is a gap on a real mirror, is because the silver is on the back of the mirror UNDER the glass. Whereas with a two-way mirror, the silver is on the surface. Keep it in mind! Make sure and check every time you enter in hotel rooms. May be someone is making a film on you.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p15645" date="Posted: Fri Nov 21, 2003 8:01 am "><author>Rayne</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">So basically, what you're saying is that we attacked Iraq because George W.

  <div class="quotecontent">The lizard brain<br /><br />Maybe you remember way back in school when you learned that the human brain still contains a prehistoric lizard brain at its center. This is the key to understanding women and what you can expect from them.<br /><br />Women still have direct contact with the lizard brain, something which men have been able to shut down about a trillion centuries ago.<br /><br />Have you ever noticed how women get cold very easily even if the temperature is only 1 µC below optimum? That's because lizards are cold-blooded, and a woman's lizard brain is telling her that she better get to a warm place quickly or her muscles will freeze up and her heart will stop beating.<br /><br />Have you noticed how a woman always seems to be thinking about two things at once? That's because a lizard's eyes point in two different directions, so it always has to process two completely different scenes.<br /><br />Have you noticed how two women can hate each other and have a serious fight, even if they don't know each other and they are sitting on opposite sides of the room? Lizards are very territorial and fight with each other by standing in one place and making threatening movements.<br /><br />Have you ever noticed how a woman drives? It's that two-direction eye problem again. That's why she thinks that it's possible to drive at high speed on a roundabout while looking in the mirror and adjusting her make-up.<br /><br />Have you noticed how a woman can sit somewhere completely happy, then suddenly out of nowhere she begins to cut you to pieces with her tongue? Well, just watch a lizard catch flies and you will know where that comes from.<br /><br />Women can lay in the sun on a big rock all day and never get bored.<br /><br />If a woman gets the chance, and she thinks that she can get away with it, she will color her hair orange and green and get it styled into a spiky hairdo. This is definitely a lizard haircut.<br /><br />I'm sure that there are hundreds of examples. The point is, the lizard brain theory explains everything. I am expecting to win the Nobel Prize this year.</div>

I offered to double-wrap, use plenty of AstroGlide, but she was still totally freaked over the idea of it. Then she made a deal with me: If I'd bend over for her strap-on, she'd bend over for me.

<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Hey,<br />This is a conversation between a father and a son...you will probably understand the reason why US attacked Iraq and how the world functions better after reading<br />this.<br /><br />Q: Daddy, why did we have to attack Iraq?<br />A: Because they had weapons of mass destruction,  honey.<br /><br />Q: But the inspectors didn't find any weapons of mass destruction.<br />A: That's because the Iraqis were hiding them.<br /><br />Q: And that's why we invaded Iraq?<br />A: Yep. Invasions always work better than  inspections.<br /><br />Q: But after we invaded them, we STILL didn't find any weapons  of mass destruction, did we?<br />A: That's because the weapons are so well hidden. Don't worry, we'll find something, probably right before the 2004 election.<br /><br />Q: Why did Iraq want all those weapons of mass  destruction?<br />A: To use them in a war, silly.<br /><br />Q: I'm confused. If they had all those weapons that they planned to use in a war, then why didn't they use any of those weapons when we  went to war with them?<br />A: Well, obviously they didn't want anyone to know they had  those weapons,so they chose to die by the thousands rather than defend themselves.<br /><br />Q: That doesn't make sense Daddy. Why would they choose to die  if they had all those big weapons to fight us back with?<br />A: It's a different culture. It's not supposed to make  sense.<br /><br />Q: I don't know about you, but I don't think they had any of those weapons our government said they did.<br />A: Well, you know, it doesn't matter whether or not they had those weapons. We had another good reason to invade them anyway.<br /><br />Q: And what was that?<br />A: Even if Iraq didn't have weapons of mass destruction, Saddam Hussein was a cruel dictator, which is another good reason to invade another country.<br /><br />Q: Why? What does a cruel dictator do that makes it OK to invade his country?<br />A: Well, for one thing, he tortured his own people.<br /><br />Q: Kind of like what they do in China?<br />A: Don't go comparing China to Iraq. China is a good economic competitor, where millions of people work for slave wages in sweatshops to make U.S. corporations richer.<br /><br />Q: So if a country lets its people be exploited for American corporate<br />gain, it's a good country, even if that country tortures people?<br />A: Right.<br /><br />Q: Why were people in Iraq being tortured?<br />A: For political crimes, mostly, like criticizing the  government. People who criticized the government in Iraq were sent to prison and tortured.<br /><br />Q: Isn't that exactly what happens in China?<br />A: I told you, China is different.<br /><br />Q: What's the difference between China and Iraq?<br />A: Well, for one thing, Iraq was ruled by the Ba'ath party, while China is Communist.<br /><br />Q: Didn't you once tell me Communists were bad?<br />A: No, just Cuban Communists are bad.<br /><br />Q: How are the Cuban Communists bad?<br />A: Well, for one thing, people who criticize the government in Cuba are sent to prison and tortured.<br /><br />Q: Like in Iraq?<br />A: Exactly.<br /><br />Q: And like in China, too?<br />A: I told you, China's a good economic competitor. Cuba, on the other hand, is not.<br /><br />Q: How come Cuba isn't a good economic competitor?<br />A: Well, you see, back in the early 1960s, our government passed some laws that made it illegal for Americans to trade or do any business with Cuba until they stopped being Communists and started being capitalists like us.<br /><br />Q: But if we got rid of those laws, opened up trade with Cuba,and started doing business with them, wouldn't that help the Cubans become capitalists?<br />A: Don't be a smart-ass.<br /><br />Q: I didn't think I was being one.<br />A: Well, anyway, they also don't have freedom of religion in Cuba.<br /><br />Q: Kind of like China and the @!#$ movement?<br />A: I told you, stop saying bad things about China. Anyway,  Saddam Hussein came to power through a military coup, so he's not really a legitimate leader anyway.<br /><br />Q: What's a military coup?<br />A: That's when a military general takes over the government of a country by force, instead of holding free elections like we do in the United States.<br /><br />Q: Didn't the ruler of Pakistan come to power by a military coup?<br />A: You mean General Pervez Musharraf? Uh, yeah, he did, but Pakistan is our friend.<br /><br />Q: Why is Pakistan our friend if their leader is illegitimate?<br />A: I never said Pervez Musharraf was illegitimate.<br /><br />Q: Didn't you just say a military general who comes to power by forcibly overthrowing the legitimate government of a nation is an illegitimate leader?<br />A: Only Saddam Hussein. Pervez Musharraf is our friend, because he helped us invade Afghanistan.<br /><br />Q: Why did we invade Afghanistan?<br />A: Because of what they did to us on September 11th.<br /><br />Q: What did Afghanistan do to us on September 11th?<br />A: Well, on September 11th, nineteen men, fifteen of them Saudi Arabians, hijacked four airplanes and flew three of them into buildings,killing over 3,000 Americans.<br /><br />Q: So how did Afghanistan figure into all that?<br />A: Afghanistan was where those bad men trained, under the oppressive rule of the Taliban.<br /><br />Q: Aren't the Taliban those bad radical Islamics who chopped off people's heads and hands?<br />A: Yes, that's exactly who they were. Not only did they chop off people's heads and hands, but they oppressed women, too.<br /><br />Q: Didn't the Bush administration giv e the Taliban 43 million dollars back in May of 2001?<br />A: Yes, but that money was a reward because they did such a good job fighting drugs.<br /><br />Q: Fighting drugs?<br />A: Yes, the Taliban were very helpful in stopping people from growing opium poppies.<br /><br />Q: How did they do such a good job?<br />A: Simple. If people were caught growing opium poppies, the Taliban would have their hands and heads cut off.<br /><br />Q: So, when the Taliban cut off people's heads and hands for growing flowers, that was OK, but not if they cut people's heads and hands off for other reasons?<br />A: Yes. It's OK with us if radical Islamic fundamentalists cut off people's hands for growing flowers, but it's cruel if they cut off people's hands for stealing bread.<br /><br />Q: Don't they also cut off people's hands and heads in Saudi Arabia?<br />A: That's different. Afghanistan was ruled by a tyrannical patriarchy that oppressed women and forced them to wear burqas whenever they  were in public, with death by stoning as the penalty for women who did not comply.<br /><br />Q: Don't Saudi women have to wear burqas in public,  too?<br />A: No, Saudi women merely wear a traditional Islamic body overing.<br /><br />Q: What's the difference?<br />A: The traditional Islamic co! vering worn by Saudi women is a modest yet fashionable garment that covers all of a woman's body xcept for her eyes and fingers. The burqa, on the other hand, is an evil tool of patriarchal oppression that covers all of a woman's body except for her eyes<br />and fingers.<br /><br />Q: It sounds like the same thing with a different  name.<br />A: Now, don't go comparing Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia. The Saudis are our friends.<br /><br />Q: But I thought you said 15 of the 19 hijackers on September 11th were from Saudi Arabia.<br />A: Yes, but they trained in Afghanistan.<br /><br />Q: Who trained them?<br />A: A very bad man named Osama bin Laden.<br /><br />Q: Was he from Afghanist! an?<br />A: Uh, no, he was from Saudi Arabia too. But he was a bad man, a very bad man.<br /><br />Q: I seem to recall he was our friend once.<br />A: Only when we helped him and the mujahadeen repel the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan back in the 1980s.<br /><br />Q: Who are the Soviets? Was that the Evil Communist Empire  Ronald Reagan talked about?<br />A: There are no more Soviets. The Soviet Union broke up in 1990 or there abouts, and now they have elections and capitalism like us. We call them Russians now.<br /><br />Q: So the Soviets, I mean, the Russians, are now our  friends?<br />A: Well, not really. You see, they were our friends for many years after they stopped being Soviets, bu t then they decided not to support our invasion of Iraq, so we're mad at them now. We're also mad at  the French and the Germans because they didn't help us invade Iraqe ither.<br /><br />Q: So the French and Germans are evil, too?<br />A: Not exactly evil, but just bad enough that we had to rename French fries and French toast to Freedom Fries and Freedom Toast.<br /><br />Q: Do we always rename foods whenever another country doesn't do what we want them to do?<br />A: No, we just do that to our friends. Our enemies, we  invade.<br /><br />Q: But wasn't Iraq one of our friends back in the  1980s?<br />A: Well, yeah. For a while.<br /><br />Q: Was Saddam Hussein ruler of Iraq back then?<br />A: Yes, but at the time he was fighting against Iran, which made him our friend, temporarily.<br /><br />Q: Why did that make him our friend?<br />A: Because at that time, Iran was our enemy.<br /><br />Q: Isn't that when he gassed the Kurds?<br />A: Yeah, but since he was fighting against Iran at the time, we looked the other way, to show him we were his friend.<br /><br />Q: So anyone who fights against one of our enemies automatically becomes our friend?<br />A: Most of the time, yes.<br /><br />Q: And anyone who fights against one of our friends is automatically an enemy?<br />A: Sometimes that's true, t! oo. However, if American corporations can profit by selling weapons to both sides at the same time, all  the better.<br /><br />Q: Why?<br />A: Because war is good for the economy, which meanswar is good for America. Also, since God is on America's side, anyone who opposes war is  a godless un-American Communist. Do you understand now why we attacked Iraq?<br /><br />Q: I think so. We attacked them because God wanted us to,r ight?<br />A: Yes.<br /><br />Q: But how did we know God wanted us to attack Iraq?<br />A: Well, you see, God personally speaks to George W. Bush and tells him what to do.<br /><br />Q: So basically, what you're saying is that we attacked Iraq because George W. Bush hears voices in his head?<br />A. Yes! You finally understand how the world works. Now close your eyes, make yourself comfortable, and go to sleep. Good night.<br /><br />Good night, Daddy.<br /></div></div>]]></body></post><post id="p13617" date="Posted: Sun Sep 28, 2003 6:00 am "><author>[sic]</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">That's great _shank.

It is Very difficult to positively identify the surface by just looking at it. So, how do we determine with any amount of certainty what type of mirror we are looking at? 
<br /><br />CONDUCT THIS SIMPLE TEST: Place the tip of your fingernail against the reflective surface and if there is a GAP between your fingernail and the image of the nail, then it is a GENUINE mirror. However, if your fingernail DIRECTLY TOUCHES the image of your nail, then BEWARE, IT IS A 2-WAY MIRROR! (there is someone seeing you from the other side).  The reason there is a gap on a real mirror, is because the silver is on the back of the mirror UNDER the glass. Whereas with a two-way mirror, the silver is on the surface. Keep it in mind! Make sure and check every time you enter in hotel rooms. May be someone is making a film on you.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p15645" date="Posted: Fri Nov 21, 2003 8:01 am "><author>Rayne</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">So basically, what you're saying is that we attacked Iraq because George W.

<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">New York Law wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">    *  A fine of $25 can be levied for flirting. This old law specifically prohibits men from turning around on any city street and looking "at a woman in that way." A second conviction for a crime of this magnitude calls for the violating male to be forced to wear a "pair of horse-blinders" wherever and whenever he goes outside for a stroll.<br />    * It is against the law to throw a ball at someone's head for fun.<br />    * The penalty for jumping off a building is death.<br />    * New Yorkers cannot dissolve a marriage for irreconcilable differences, unless they both agree to it. That rarely happens, since one party regularly says "no" to the other, or there wouldn't be a reason to dissolve the marriage. If one of the spouses says "no" to the divorce, the other party has to prove that the spouse saying "no" was at fault. Fault could be one of four terrible things. If the spouse has abandoned the other spouse, that is, left the house for a year or if there hasn't been sexual relations for a year (how do you prove that?). Another one of the four terrible things, an oft cited fault, is to assert that the spouse has treated the other spouse with physical or mental cruelty. This is usually the case in most deteriorating marriages, but for the court's purposes, yelling and screaming is not usually enough; pictures of bruises taken in the emergency room might suffice. Divorce will be easy if the spouse has been imprisoned for two or three years. Much more difficult is the last fault, adultery. This keeps a lot of private detectives in business, since lipstick on the collar is not proof. It also means that lawyers get paid to "prove" fault, or on the other side, to show how lame the opposing side's "fault" claim is.<br />    * A person may not walk around on Sundays with an ice cream cone in his/her pocket.<br />    * While riding in an elevator, one must talk to no one, and fold his hands while looking toward the door.<br />    * Slippers are not to be worn after 10:00 P.M.<br /></div></div>]]></body></post><post id="p21799" date="Posted: Wed Apr 14, 2004 10:02 am "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081119060859/http://www.hypocrites.com/pictures/?TopicID=signs">http://www.hypocrites.com/pictures/?TopicID=signs</a><!-- m -->

The story described how 19-year-old Jami Johnson of Lewiston had forgotten her wallet on the counter at the store, loaded with $600 cash, three credit cards, her Social Security card and driver's license. She'd just cashed her paycheck, she said, and needed the money for Christmas.<br /><br />Video screens, from multiple angles, showed Millhouse snatching the wallet and leaving the store with it.<br /><br />The two pictures, running one above the other, led to Millhouse's arrest Thursday and the recovery of Johnson's wallet.<br /><br />Phone calls flooded the Tribune from readers hoping to be the first to connect the dots and nab the Christmas Grinch.<br /><br />"I didn't do what the media has put out there," Millhouse said. "I'm not just a fat guy that walks around Zip Trip eating beef sticks and drinking coffee."<br /><br />But he did admit taking the wallet.<br /><br />"Our editors (Wednesday) night noticed the similarities in the two photos," said Paul Emerson, Tribune managing editor. "We are not crime-stoppers here. It is just a weird coincidence. If it did solve a crime, I'm glad it happened. I have seen nothing like this in my 26 years as Tribune managing editor."<br /><br />A Tribune employee originally alerted police about 3 a.m. Thursday to the obvious similarities between the men in both pictures. The employee wanted police to see the front page before Millhouse did.<br /><br />The employee pointed out millhouse was clearly the man police were seeking, sporting his blue - and black - checkered jacket and dark - colored, hooded sweatshirt in both pictures.<br /><br />Clarkston police officer Jeremy Maguire contacted millhouse, and he was arrested.<br /><br />Millhouse was charged with second - degree theft, and appeared in Asotin County Superior Court and eventually was released from jail after a $5, 000 bond was posted.<br /><br />Asotin County Prosecutor Ben Nichols said Millhouse is scheduled to be back in court Monday for arraignment.<br /><br />Millhouse initially denied taking the wallet, authorities said. He later told police he took it because he thought it was his wife's. The wallet allegedly was found at his business. The money was gone, but the credit cards, Social Security card and driver's license were still there, police said.<br /><br />"Video camera evidence has assisted us in solving a lot of crimes," Clarkston Police Chief Joel Hastings said. "But we have never had a situation quite like this in my memory."<br /><br />Hastings said the pictures ending up next to each other in the newspaper was a fortunate coincidence.<br /><br />Millhouse told the Tribune he picked up the wallet intending to return it to its owner sometime on Tuesday, but got bogged down with work and forgot about the wallet he'd left at his business. He was bogged down with work on Wednesday, too, when he was spotted by Tribune photographer Kyle Mills, who snapped pictures of Millhouse as he decorated windows.<br /><br />He didn't hand the wallet over to store employees, he said, because it had a better chance of being returned to the owner with all its contents if he handled the situation. His only mistake, he said, was not returning it sooner.<br /><br />"I don't return purses every day for a living," Millhouse said.<br /><br />In a signed statement to police, Millhouse said taking the wallet was the "most stupid decision of my life, that I should be ashamed for the rest of my life," according to the court document. "Not only was it wrong, but it was against my morals as a person of faith."<br /><br />Millhouse continued in the statement, saying he wanted to "right the wrong I created."<br /><br />"I always liked the Grinch. I guess I am one," he said in the interview with the Tribune. "I am sorry for embarrassing the community and being the Grinch this year."<br /><br />"It was amazing," Johnson said of getting her wallet back. Authorities told her that Millhouse, if found guilty, would have to pay restitution for the money.<br /><br />"I feel the paper and everybody did a great job," said Paul Johnson, 45, of Clarkston, Jami Johnson's father. "I believe in karma. What he did was wrong and he needed to be caught."</div></div>]]></body></post><post id="p193113" date="Posted: Mon Dec 24, 2007 4:57 pm "><author>pbmax</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold">Messin' with Sasquatch Commercials</span><br /><br />1. <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081117113046/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpTXjxU3WLQ">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpTXjxU3WLQ</a><!-- m --><br />2. <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081117113046/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVM62idO9MA">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVM62idO9MA</a><!-- m --><br />3. <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081117113046/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIUKjpBo_OM">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIUKjpBo_OM</a><!-- m --><br />4. <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081117113046/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jfp2gOOaR-g">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jfp2gOOaR-g</a><!-- m --><br /><br />omg, these are so funny. i've watched them over and over and still giggle like a little school girl each and every time.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p193120" date="Posted: Mon Dec 24, 2007 7:56 pm "><author>MBolus</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">pbmax wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><span style="font-weight: bold">Messin' with Sasquatch Commercials</span></div><br />Don't forget this one:<br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081117112957/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2d_m2OVa_g&amp;feature=related" class="postlink">Water Bowl Prank</a></div>]]></body></post><post id="p193147" date="Posted: Tue Dec 25, 2007 4:11 pm "><author>Darkr0nin</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">In the spirit of Christmas: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081117112957/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oCOQHtQvZo&amp;feature=related">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oCOQHtQ ... re=related</a><!-- m --></div>]]></body></post><post id="p195326" date="Posted: Wed Feb 20, 2008 6:59 pm "><author>The Happy Friar</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Holy crap, my e-mail is EVIL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">			<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081117112957im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/download/file.php?id=50" alt="evil_mail.jpg" /><br /><span class="gensmall">evil_mail.jpg [ 15.77 KB | Viewed 824 times ]</span>

It seems that Conan O' Brien's show is freaking hilarious without writers. With the writers, they run funny bits but they do it over and over again, so it gets old and dull. The writers strike forced Conan to do some new stuff, and it turned out to be hilarious.

  <div class="quotecontent">The lizard brain<br /><br />Maybe you remember way back in school when you learned that the human brain still contains a prehistoric lizard brain at its center. This is the key to understanding women and what you can expect from them.<br /><br />Women still have direct contact with the lizard brain, something which men have been able to shut down about a trillion centuries ago.<br /><br />Have you ever noticed how women get cold very easily even if the temperature is only 1 µC below optimum? That's because lizards are cold-blooded, and a woman's lizard brain is telling her that she better get to a warm place quickly or her muscles will freeze up and her heart will stop beating.<br /><br />Have you noticed how a woman always seems to be thinking about two things at once? That's because a lizard's eyes point in two different directions, so it always has to process two completely different scenes.<br /><br />Have you noticed how two women can hate each other and have a serious fight, even if they don't know each other and they are sitting on opposite sides of the room? Lizards are very territorial and fight with each other by standing in one place and making threatening movements.<br /><br />Have you ever noticed how a woman drives? It's that two-direction eye problem again. That's why she thinks that it's possible to drive at high speed on a roundabout while looking in the mirror and adjusting her make-up.<br /><br />Have you noticed how a woman can sit somewhere completely happy, then suddenly out of nowhere she begins to cut you to pieces with her tongue? Well, just watch a lizard catch flies and you will know where that comes from.<br /><br />Women can lay in the sun on a big rock all day and never get bored.<br /><br />If a woman gets the chance, and she thinks that she can get away with it, she will color her hair orange and green and get it styled into a spiky hairdo. This is definitely a lizard haircut.<br /><br />I'm sure that there are hundreds of examples. The point is, the lizard brain theory explains everything. I am expecting to win the Nobel Prize this year.</div>

<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Hey,<br />This is a conversation between a father and a son...you will probably understand the reason why US attacked Iraq and how the world functions better after reading<br />this.<br /><br />Q: Daddy, why did we have to attack Iraq?<br />A: Because they had weapons of mass destruction,  honey.<br /><br />Q: But the inspectors didn't find any weapons of mass destruction.<br />A: That's because the Iraqis were hiding them.<br /><br />Q: And that's why we invaded Iraq?<br />A: Yep. Invasions always work better than  inspections.<br /><br />Q: But after we invaded them, we STILL didn't find any weapons  of mass destruction, did we?<br />A: That's because the weapons are so well hidden. Don't worry, we'll find something, probably right before the 2004 election.<br /><br />Q: Why did Iraq want all those weapons of mass  destruction?<br />A: To use them in a war, silly.<br /><br />Q: I'm confused. If they had all those weapons that they planned to use in a war, then why didn't they use any of those weapons when we  went to war with them?<br />A: Well, obviously they didn't want anyone to know they had  those weapons,so they chose to die by the thousands rather than defend themselves.<br /><br />Q: That doesn't make sense Daddy. Why would they choose to die  if they had all those big weapons to fight us back with?<br />A: It's a different culture. It's not supposed to make  sense.<br /><br />Q: I don't know about you, but I don't think they had any of those weapons our government said they did.<br />A: Well, you know, it doesn't matter whether or not they had those weapons. We had another good reason to invade them anyway.<br /><br />Q: And what was that?<br />A: Even if Iraq didn't have weapons of mass destruction, Saddam Hussein was a cruel dictator, which is another good reason to invade another country.<br /><br />Q: Why? What does a cruel dictator do that makes it OK to invade his country?<br />A: Well, for one thing, he tortured his own people.<br /><br />Q: Kind of like what they do in China?<br />A: Don't go comparing China to Iraq. China is a good economic competitor, where millions of people work for slave wages in sweatshops to make U.S. corporations richer.<br /><br />Q: So if a country lets its people be exploited for American corporate<br />gain, it's a good country, even if that country tortures people?<br />A: Right.<br /><br />Q: Why were people in Iraq being tortured?<br />A: For political crimes, mostly, like criticizing the  government. People who criticized the government in Iraq were sent to prison and tortured.<br /><br />Q: Isn't that exactly what happens in China?<br />A: I told you, China is different.<br /><br />Q: What's the difference between China and Iraq?<br />A: Well, for one thing, Iraq was ruled by the Ba'ath party, while China is Communist.<br /><br />Q: Didn't you once tell me Communists were bad?<br />A: No, just Cuban Communists are bad.<br /><br />Q: How are the Cuban Communists bad?<br />A: Well, for one thing, people who criticize the government in Cuba are sent to prison and tortured.<br /><br />Q: Like in Iraq?<br />A: Exactly.<br /><br />Q: And like in China, too?<br />A: I told you, China's a good economic competitor. Cuba, on the other hand, is not.<br /><br />Q: How come Cuba isn't a good economic competitor?<br />A: Well, you see, back in the early 1960s, our government passed some laws that made it illegal for Americans to trade or do any business with Cuba until they stopped being Communists and started being capitalists like us.<br /><br />Q: But if we got rid of those laws, opened up trade with Cuba,and started doing business with them, wouldn't that help the Cubans become capitalists?<br />A: Don't be a smart-ass.<br /><br />Q: I didn't think I was being one.<br />A: Well, anyway, they also don't have freedom of religion in Cuba.<br /><br />Q: Kind of like China and the @!#$ movement?<br />A: I told you, stop saying bad things about China. Anyway,  Saddam Hussein came to power through a military coup, so he's not really a legitimate leader anyway.<br /><br />Q: What's a military coup?<br />A: That's when a military general takes over the government of a country by force, instead of holding free elections like we do in the United States.<br /><br />Q: Didn't the ruler of Pakistan come to power by a military coup?<br />A: You mean General Pervez Musharraf? Uh, yeah, he did, but Pakistan is our friend.<br /><br />Q: Why is Pakistan our friend if their leader is illegitimate?<br />A: I never said Pervez Musharraf was illegitimate.<br /><br />Q: Didn't you just say a military general who comes to power by forcibly overthrowing the legitimate government of a nation is an illegitimate leader?<br />A: Only Saddam Hussein. Pervez Musharraf is our friend, because he helped us invade Afghanistan.<br /><br />Q: Why did we invade Afghanistan?<br />A: Because of what they did to us on September 11th.<br /><br />Q: What did Afghanistan do to us on September 11th?<br />A: Well, on September 11th, nineteen men, fifteen of them Saudi Arabians, hijacked four airplanes and flew three of them into buildings,killing over 3,000 Americans.<br /><br />Q: So how did Afghanistan figure into all that?<br />A: Afghanistan was where those bad men trained, under the oppressive rule of the Taliban.<br /><br />Q: Aren't the Taliban those bad radical Islamics who chopped off people's heads and hands?<br />A: Yes, that's exactly who they were. Not only did they chop off people's heads and hands, but they oppressed women, too.<br /><br />Q: Didn't the Bush administration giv e the Taliban 43 million dollars back in May of 2001?<br />A: Yes, but that money was a reward because they did such a good job fighting drugs.<br /><br />Q: Fighting drugs?<br />A: Yes, the Taliban were very helpful in stopping people from growing opium poppies.<br /><br />Q: How did they do such a good job?<br />A: Simple. If people were caught growing opium poppies, the Taliban would have their hands and heads cut off.<br /><br />Q: So, when the Taliban cut off people's heads and hands for growing flowers, that was OK, but not if they cut people's heads and hands off for other reasons?<br />A: Yes. It's OK with us if radical Islamic fundamentalists cut off people's hands for growing flowers, but it's cruel if they cut off people's hands for stealing bread.<br /><br />Q: Don't they also cut off people's hands and heads in Saudi Arabia?<br />A: That's different. Afghanistan was ruled by a tyrannical patriarchy that oppressed women and forced them to wear burqas whenever they  were in public, with death by stoning as the penalty for women who did not comply.<br /><br />Q: Don't Saudi women have to wear burqas in public,  too?<br />A: No, Saudi women merely wear a traditional Islamic body overing.<br /><br />Q: What's the difference?<br />A: The traditional Islamic co! vering worn by Saudi women is a modest yet fashionable garment that covers all of a woman's body xcept for her eyes and fingers. The burqa, on the other hand, is an evil tool of patriarchal oppression that covers all of a woman's body except for her eyes<br />and fingers.<br /><br />Q: It sounds like the same thing with a different  name.<br />A: Now, don't go comparing Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia. The Saudis are our friends.<br /><br />Q: But I thought you said 15 of the 19 hijackers on September 11th were from Saudi Arabia.<br />A: Yes, but they trained in Afghanistan.<br /><br />Q: Who trained them?<br />A: A very bad man named Osama bin Laden.<br /><br />Q: Was he from Afghanist! an?<br />A: Uh, no, he was from Saudi Arabia too. But he was a bad man, a very bad man.<br /><br />Q: I seem to recall he was our friend once.<br />A: Only when we helped him and the mujahadeen repel the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan back in the 1980s.<br /><br />Q: Who are the Soviets? Was that the Evil Communist Empire  Ronald Reagan talked about?<br />A: There are no more Soviets. The Soviet Union broke up in 1990 or there abouts, and now they have elections and capitalism like us. We call them Russians now.<br /><br />Q: So the Soviets, I mean, the Russians, are now our  friends?<br />A: Well, not really. You see, they were our friends for many years after they stopped being Soviets, bu t then they decided not to support our invasion of Iraq, so we're mad at them now. We're also mad at  the French and the Germans because they didn't help us invade Iraqe ither.<br /><br />Q: So the French and Germans are evil, too?<br />A: Not exactly evil, but just bad enough that we had to rename French fries and French toast to Freedom Fries and Freedom Toast.<br /><br />Q: Do we always rename foods whenever another country doesn't do what we want them to do?<br />A: No, we just do that to our friends. Our enemies, we  invade.<br /><br />Q: But wasn't Iraq one of our friends back in the  1980s?<br />A: Well, yeah. For a while.<br /><br />Q: Was Saddam Hussein ruler of Iraq back then?<br />A: Yes, but at the time he was fighting against Iran, which made him our friend, temporarily.<br /><br />Q: Why did that make him our friend?<br />A: Because at that time, Iran was our enemy.<br /><br />Q: Isn't that when he gassed the Kurds?<br />A: Yeah, but since he was fighting against Iran at the time, we looked the other way, to show him we were his friend.<br /><br />Q: So anyone who fights against one of our enemies automatically becomes our friend?<br />A: Most of the time, yes.<br /><br />Q: And anyone who fights against one of our friends is automatically an enemy?<br />A: Sometimes that's true, t! oo. However, if American corporations can profit by selling weapons to both sides at the same time, all  the better.<br /><br />Q: Why?<br />A: Because war is good for the economy, which meanswar is good for America. Also, since God is on America's side, anyone who opposes war is  a godless un-American Communist. Do you understand now why we attacked Iraq?<br /><br />Q: I think so. We attacked them because God wanted us to,r ight?<br />A: Yes.<br /><br />Q: But how did we know God wanted us to attack Iraq?<br />A: Well, you see, God personally speaks to George W. Bush and tells him what to do.<br /><br />Q: So basically, what you're saying is that we attacked Iraq because George W. Bush hears voices in his head?<br />A. Yes! You finally understand how the world works. Now close your eyes, make yourself comfortable, and go to sleep. Good night.<br /><br />Good night, Daddy.<br /></div></div>]]></body></post><post id="p13617" date="Posted: Sun Sep 28, 2003 6:00 am "><author>[sic]</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">That's great _shank.

It is Very difficult to positively identify the surface by just looking at it. So, how do we determine with any amount of certainty what type of mirror we are looking at? 
<br /><br />CONDUCT THIS SIMPLE TEST: Place the tip of your fingernail against the reflective surface and if there is a GAP between your fingernail and the image of the nail, then it is a GENUINE mirror. However, if your fingernail DIRECTLY TOUCHES the image of your nail, then BEWARE, IT IS A 2-WAY MIRROR! (there is someone seeing you from the other side).  The reason there is a gap on a real mirror, is because the silver is on the back of the mirror UNDER the glass. Whereas with a two-way mirror, the silver is on the surface. Keep it in mind! Make sure and check every time you enter in hotel rooms. May be someone is making a film on you.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p15645" date="Posted: Fri Nov 21, 2003 8:01 am "><author>Rayne</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">So basically, what you're saying is that we attacked Iraq because George W.

  <div class="quotecontent">The lizard brain<br /><br />Maybe you remember way back in school when you learned that the human brain still contains a prehistoric lizard brain at its center. This is the key to understanding women and what you can expect from them.<br /><br />Women still have direct contact with the lizard brain, something which men have been able to shut down about a trillion centuries ago.<br /><br />Have you ever noticed how women get cold very easily even if the temperature is only 1 µC below optimum? That's because lizards are cold-blooded, and a woman's lizard brain is telling her that she better get to a warm place quickly or her muscles will freeze up and her heart will stop beating.<br /><br />Have you noticed how a woman always seems to be thinking about two things at once? That's because a lizard's eyes point in two different directions, so it always has to process two completely different scenes.<br /><br />Have you noticed how two women can hate each other and have a serious fight, even if they don't know each other and they are sitting on opposite sides of the room? Lizards are very territorial and fight with each other by standing in one place and making threatening movements.<br /><br />Have you ever noticed how a woman drives? It's that two-direction eye problem again. That's why she thinks that it's possible to drive at high speed on a roundabout while looking in the mirror and adjusting her make-up.<br /><br />Have you noticed how a woman can sit somewhere completely happy, then suddenly out of nowhere she begins to cut you to pieces with her tongue? Well, just watch a lizard catch flies and you will know where that comes from.<br /><br />Women can lay in the sun on a big rock all day and never get bored.<br /><br />If a woman gets the chance, and she thinks that she can get away with it, she will color her hair orange and green and get it styled into a spiky hairdo. This is definitely a lizard haircut.<br /><br />I'm sure that there are hundreds of examples. The point is, the lizard brain theory explains everything. I am expecting to win the Nobel Prize this year.</div>

<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Hey,<br />This is a conversation between a father and a son...you will probably understand the reason why US attacked Iraq and how the world functions better after reading<br />this.<br /><br />Q: Daddy, why did we have to attack Iraq?<br />A: Because they had weapons of mass destruction,  honey.<br /><br />Q: But the inspectors didn't find any weapons of mass destruction.<br />A: That's because the Iraqis were hiding them.<br /><br />Q: And that's why we invaded Iraq?<br />A: Yep. Invasions always work better than  inspections.<br /><br />Q: But after we invaded them, we STILL didn't find any weapons  of mass destruction, did we?<br />A: That's because the weapons are so well hidden. Don't worry, we'll find something, probably right before the 2004 election.<br /><br />Q: Why did Iraq want all those weapons of mass  destruction?<br />A: To use them in a war, silly.<br /><br />Q: I'm confused. If they had all those weapons that they planned to use in a war, then why didn't they use any of those weapons when we  went to war with them?<br />A: Well, obviously they didn't want anyone to know they had  those weapons,so they chose to die by the thousands rather than defend themselves.<br /><br />Q: That doesn't make sense Daddy. Why would they choose to die  if they had all those big weapons to fight us back with?<br />A: It's a different culture. It's not supposed to make  sense.<br /><br />Q: I don't know about you, but I don't think they had any of those weapons our government said they did.<br />A: Well, you know, it doesn't matter whether or not they had those weapons. We had another good reason to invade them anyway.<br /><br />Q: And what was that?<br />A: Even if Iraq didn't have weapons of mass destruction, Saddam Hussein was a cruel dictator, which is another good reason to invade another country.<br /><br />Q: Why? What does a cruel dictator do that makes it OK to invade his country?<br />A: Well, for one thing, he tortured his own people.<br /><br />Q: Kind of like what they do in China?<br />A: Don't go comparing China to Iraq. China is a good economic competitor, where millions of people work for slave wages in sweatshops to make U.S. corporations richer.<br /><br />Q: So if a country lets its people be exploited for American corporate<br />gain, it's a good country, even if that country tortures people?<br />A: Right.<br /><br />Q: Why were people in Iraq being tortured?<br />A: For political crimes, mostly, like criticizing the  government. People who criticized the government in Iraq were sent to prison and tortured.<br /><br />Q: Isn't that exactly what happens in China?<br />A: I told you, China is different.<br /><br />Q: What's the difference between China and Iraq?<br />A: Well, for one thing, Iraq was ruled by the Ba'ath party, while China is Communist.<br /><br />Q: Didn't you once tell me Communists were bad?<br />A: No, just Cuban Communists are bad.<br /><br />Q: How are the Cuban Communists bad?<br />A: Well, for one thing, people who criticize the government in Cuba are sent to prison and tortured.<br /><br />Q: Like in Iraq?<br />A: Exactly.<br /><br />Q: And like in China, too?<br />A: I told you, China's a good economic competitor. Cuba, on the other hand, is not.<br /><br />Q: How come Cuba isn't a good economic competitor?<br />A: Well, you see, back in the early 1960s, our government passed some laws that made it illegal for Americans to trade or do any business with Cuba until they stopped being Communists and started being capitalists like us.<br /><br />Q: But if we got rid of those laws, opened up trade with Cuba,and started doing business with them, wouldn't that help the Cubans become capitalists?<br />A: Don't be a smart-ass.<br /><br />Q: I didn't think I was being one.<br />A: Well, anyway, they also don't have freedom of religion in Cuba.<br /><br />Q: Kind of like China and the @!#$ movement?<br />A: I told you, stop saying bad things about China. Anyway,  Saddam Hussein came to power through a military coup, so he's not really a legitimate leader anyway.<br /><br />Q: What's a military coup?<br />A: That's when a military general takes over the government of a country by force, instead of holding free elections like we do in the United States.<br /><br />Q: Didn't the ruler of Pakistan come to power by a military coup?<br />A: You mean General Pervez Musharraf? Uh, yeah, he did, but Pakistan is our friend.<br /><br />Q: Why is Pakistan our friend if their leader is illegitimate?<br />A: I never said Pervez Musharraf was illegitimate.<br /><br />Q: Didn't you just say a military general who comes to power by forcibly overthrowing the legitimate government of a nation is an illegitimate leader?<br />A: Only Saddam Hussein. Pervez Musharraf is our friend, because he helped us invade Afghanistan.<br /><br />Q: Why did we invade Afghanistan?<br />A: Because of what they did to us on September 11th.<br /><br />Q: What did Afghanistan do to us on September 11th?<br />A: Well, on September 11th, nineteen men, fifteen of them Saudi Arabians, hijacked four airplanes and flew three of them into buildings,killing over 3,000 Americans.<br /><br />Q: So how did Afghanistan figure into all that?<br />A: Afghanistan was where those bad men trained, under the oppressive rule of the Taliban.<br /><br />Q: Aren't the Taliban those bad radical Islamics who chopped off people's heads and hands?<br />A: Yes, that's exactly who they were. Not only did they chop off people's heads and hands, but they oppressed women, too.<br /><br />Q: Didn't the Bush administration giv e the Taliban 43 million dollars back in May of 2001?<br />A: Yes, but that money was a reward because they did such a good job fighting drugs.<br /><br />Q: Fighting drugs?<br />A: Yes, the Taliban were very helpful in stopping people from growing opium poppies.<br /><br />Q: How did they do such a good job?<br />A: Simple. If people were caught growing opium poppies, the Taliban would have their hands and heads cut off.<br /><br />Q: So, when the Taliban cut off people's heads and hands for growing flowers, that was OK, but not if they cut people's heads and hands off for other reasons?<br />A: Yes. It's OK with us if radical Islamic fundamentalists cut off people's hands for growing flowers, but it's cruel if they cut off people's hands for stealing bread.<br /><br />Q: Don't they also cut off people's hands and heads in Saudi Arabia?<br />A: That's different. Afghanistan was ruled by a tyrannical patriarchy that oppressed women and forced them to wear burqas whenever they  were in public, with death by stoning as the penalty for women who did not comply.<br /><br />Q: Don't Saudi women have to wear burqas in public,  too?<br />A: No, Saudi women merely wear a traditional Islamic body overing.<br /><br />Q: What's the difference?<br />A: The traditional Islamic co! vering worn by Saudi women is a modest yet fashionable garment that covers all of a woman's body xcept for her eyes and fingers. The burqa, on the other hand, is an evil tool of patriarchal oppression that covers all of a woman's body except for her eyes<br />and fingers.<br /><br />Q: It sounds like the same thing with a different  name.<br />A: Now, don't go comparing Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia. The Saudis are our friends.<br /><br />Q: But I thought you said 15 of the 19 hijackers on September 11th were from Saudi Arabia.<br />A: Yes, but they trained in Afghanistan.<br /><br />Q: Who trained them?<br />A: A very bad man named Osama bin Laden.<br /><br />Q: Was he from Afghanist! an?<br />A: Uh, no, he was from Saudi Arabia too. But he was a bad man, a very bad man.<br /><br />Q: I seem to recall he was our friend once.<br />A: Only when we helped him and the mujahadeen repel the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan back in the 1980s.<br /><br />Q: Who are the Soviets? Was that the Evil Communist Empire  Ronald Reagan talked about?<br />A: There are no more Soviets. The Soviet Union broke up in 1990 or there abouts, and now they have elections and capitalism like us. We call them Russians now.<br /><br />Q: So the Soviets, I mean, the Russians, are now our  friends?<br />A: Well, not really. You see, they were our friends for many years after they stopped being Soviets, bu t then they decided not to support our invasion of Iraq, so we're mad at them now. We're also mad at  the French and the Germans because they didn't help us invade Iraqe ither.<br /><br />Q: So the French and Germans are evil, too?<br />A: Not exactly evil, but just bad enough that we had to rename French fries and French toast to Freedom Fries and Freedom Toast.<br /><br />Q: Do we always rename foods whenever another country doesn't do what we want them to do?<br />A: No, we just do that to our friends. Our enemies, we  invade.<br /><br />Q: But wasn't Iraq one of our friends back in the  1980s?<br />A: Well, yeah. For a while.<br /><br />Q: Was Saddam Hussein ruler of Iraq back then?<br />A: Yes, but at the time he was fighting against Iran, which made him our friend, temporarily.<br /><br />Q: Why did that make him our friend?<br />A: Because at that time, Iran was our enemy.<br /><br />Q: Isn't that when he gassed the Kurds?<br />A: Yeah, but since he was fighting against Iran at the time, we looked the other way, to show him we were his friend.<br /><br />Q: So anyone who fights against one of our enemies automatically becomes our friend?<br />A: Most of the time, yes.<br /><br />Q: And anyone who fights against one of our friends is automatically an enemy?<br />A: Sometimes that's true, t! oo. However, if American corporations can profit by selling weapons to both sides at the same time, all  the better.<br /><br />Q: Why?<br />A: Because war is good for the economy, which meanswar is good for America. Also, since God is on America's side, anyone who opposes war is  a godless un-American Communist. Do you understand now why we attacked Iraq?<br /><br />Q: I think so. We attacked them because God wanted us to,r ight?<br />A: Yes.<br /><br />Q: But how did we know God wanted us to attack Iraq?<br />A: Well, you see, God personally speaks to George W. Bush and tells him what to do.<br /><br />Q: So basically, what you're saying is that we attacked Iraq because George W. Bush hears voices in his head?<br />A. Yes! You finally understand how the world works. Now close your eyes, make yourself comfortable, and go to sleep.

It is Very difficult to positively identify the surface by just looking at it. So, how do we determine with any amount of certainty what type of mirror we are looking at? 
<br /><br />CONDUCT THIS SIMPLE TEST: Place the tip of your fingernail against the reflective surface and if there is a GAP between your fingernail and the image of the nail, then it is a GENUINE mirror. However, if your fingernail DIRECTLY TOUCHES the image of your nail, then BEWARE, IT IS A 2-WAY MIRROR! (there is someone seeing you from the other side).  The reason there is a gap on a real mirror, is because the silver is on the back of the mirror UNDER the glass. Whereas with a two-way mirror, the silver is on the surface. Keep it in mind! Make sure and check every time you enter in hotel rooms. May be someone is making a film on you.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p15645" date="Posted: Fri Nov 21, 2003 8:01 am "><author>Rayne</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">So basically, what you're saying is that we attacked Iraq because George W.

  <div class="quotecontent">The lizard brain<br /><br />Maybe you remember way back in school when you learned that the human brain still contains a prehistoric lizard brain at its center. This is the key to understanding women and what you can expect from them.<br /><br />Women still have direct contact with the lizard brain, something which men have been able to shut down about a trillion centuries ago.<br /><br />Have you ever noticed how women get cold very easily even if the temperature is only 1 µC below optimum? That's because lizards are cold-blooded, and a woman's lizard brain is telling her that she better get to a warm place quickly or her muscles will freeze up and her heart will stop beating.<br /><br />Have you noticed how a woman always seems to be thinking about two things at once? That's because a lizard's eyes point in two different directions, so it always has to process two completely different scenes.<br /><br />Have you noticed how two women can hate each other and have a serious fight, even if they don't know each other and they are sitting on opposite sides of the room? Lizards are very territorial and fight with each other by standing in one place and making threatening movements.<br /><br />Have you ever noticed how a woman drives? It's that two-direction eye problem again. That's why she thinks that it's possible to drive at high speed on a roundabout while looking in the mirror and adjusting her make-up.<br /><br />Have you noticed how a woman can sit somewhere completely happy, then suddenly out of nowhere she begins to cut you to pieces with her tongue? Well, just watch a lizard catch flies and you will know where that comes from.<br /><br />Women can lay in the sun on a big rock all day and never get bored.<br /><br />If a woman gets the chance, and she thinks that she can get away with it, she will color her hair orange and green and get it styled into a spiky hairdo. This is definitely a lizard haircut.<br /><br />I'm sure that there are hundreds of examples. The point is, the lizard brain theory explains everything. I am expecting to win the Nobel Prize this year.</div>

<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Hey,<br />This is a conversation between a father and a son...you will probably understand the reason why US attacked Iraq and how the world functions better after reading<br />this.<br /><br />Q: Daddy, why did we have to attack Iraq?<br />A: Because they had weapons of mass destruction,  honey.<br /><br />Q: But the inspectors didn't find any weapons of mass destruction.<br />A: That's because the Iraqis were hiding them.<br /><br />Q: And that's why we invaded Iraq?<br />A: Yep. Invasions always work better than  inspections.<br /><br />Q: But after we invaded them, we STILL didn't find any weapons  of mass destruction, did we?<br />A: That's because the weapons are so well hidden. Don't worry, we'll find something, probably right before the 2004 election.<br /><br />Q: Why did Iraq want all those weapons of mass  destruction?<br />A: To use them in a war, silly.<br /><br />Q: I'm confused. If they had all those weapons that they planned to use in a war, then why didn't they use any of those weapons when we  went to war with them?<br />A: Well, obviously they didn't want anyone to know they had  those weapons,so they chose to die by the thousands rather than defend themselves.<br /><br />Q: That doesn't make sense Daddy. Why would they choose to die  if they had all those big weapons to fight us back with?<br />A: It's a different culture. It's not supposed to make  sense.<br /><br />Q: I don't know about you, but I don't think they had any of those weapons our government said they did.<br />A: Well, you know, it doesn't matter whether or not they had those weapons. We had another good reason to invade them anyway.<br /><br />Q: And what was that?<br />A: Even if Iraq didn't have weapons of mass destruction, Saddam Hussein was a cruel dictator, which is another good reason to invade another country.<br /><br />Q: Why? What does a cruel dictator do that makes it OK to invade his country?<br />A: Well, for one thing, he tortured his own people.<br /><br />Q: Kind of like what they do in China?<br />A: Don't go comparing China to Iraq. China is a good economic competitor, where millions of people work for slave wages in sweatshops to make U.S. corporations richer.<br /><br />Q: So if a country lets its people be exploited for American corporate<br />gain, it's a good country, even if that country tortures people?<br />A: Right.<br /><br />Q: Why were people in Iraq being tortured?<br />A: For political crimes, mostly, like criticizing the  government. People who criticized the government in Iraq were sent to prison and tortured.<br /><br />Q: Isn't that exactly what happens in China?<br />A: I told you, China is different.<br /><br />Q: What's the difference between China and Iraq?<br />A: Well, for one thing, Iraq was ruled by the Ba'ath party, while China is Communist.<br /><br />Q: Didn't you once tell me Communists were bad?<br />A: No, just Cuban Communists are bad.<br /><br />Q: How are the Cuban Communists bad?<br />A: Well, for one thing, people who criticize the government in Cuba are sent to prison and tortured.<br /><br />Q: Like in Iraq?<br />A: Exactly.<br /><br />Q: And like in China, too?<br />A: I told you, China's a good economic competitor. Cuba, on the other hand, is not.<br /><br />Q: How come Cuba isn't a good economic competitor?<br />A: Well, you see, back in the early 1960s, our government passed some laws that made it illegal for Americans to trade or do any business with Cuba until they stopped being Communists and started being capitalists like us.<br /><br />Q: But if we got rid of those laws, opened up trade with Cuba,and started doing business with them, wouldn't that help the Cubans become capitalists?<br />A: Don't be a smart-ass.<br /><br />Q: I didn't think I was being one.<br />A: Well, anyway, they also don't have freedom of religion in Cuba.<br /><br />Q: Kind of like China and the @!#$ movement?<br />A: I told you, stop saying bad things about China. Anyway,  Saddam Hussein came to power through a military coup, so he's not really a legitimate leader anyway.<br /><br />Q: What's a military coup?<br />A: That's when a military general takes over the government of a country by force, instead of holding free elections like we do in the United States.<br /><br />Q: Didn't the ruler of Pakistan come to power by a military coup?<br />A: You mean General Pervez Musharraf? Uh, yeah, he did, but Pakistan is our friend.<br /><br />Q: Why is Pakistan our friend if their leader is illegitimate?<br />A: I never said Pervez Musharraf was illegitimate.<br /><br />Q: Didn't you just say a military general who comes to power by forcibly overthrowing the legitimate government of a nation is an illegitimate leader?<br />A: Only Saddam Hussein. Pervez Musharraf is our friend, because he helped us invade Afghanistan.<br /><br />Q: Why did we invade Afghanistan?<br />A: Because of what they did to us on September 11th.<br /><br />Q: What did Afghanistan do to us on September 11th?<br />A: Well, on September 11th, nineteen men, fifteen of them Saudi Arabians, hijacked four airplanes and flew three of them into buildings,killing over 3,000 Americans.<br /><br />Q: So how did Afghanistan figure into all that?<br />A: Afghanistan was where those bad men trained, under the oppressive rule of the Taliban.<br /><br />Q: Aren't the Taliban those bad radical Islamics who chopped off people's heads and hands?<br />A: Yes, that's exactly who they were. Not only did they chop off people's heads and hands, but they oppressed women, too.<br /><br />Q: Didn't the Bush administration giv e the Taliban 43 million dollars back in May of 2001?<br />A: Yes, but that money was a reward because they did such a good job fighting drugs.<br /><br />Q: Fighting drugs?<br />A: Yes, the Taliban were very helpful in stopping people from growing opium poppies.<br /><br />Q: How did they do such a good job?<br />A: Simple. If people were caught growing opium poppies, the Taliban would have their hands and heads cut off.<br /><br />Q: So, when the Taliban cut off people's heads and hands for growing flowers, that was OK, but not if they cut people's heads and hands off for other reasons?<br />A: Yes. It's OK with us if radical Islamic fundamentalists cut off people's hands for growing flowers, but it's cruel if they cut off people's hands for stealing bread.<br /><br />Q: Don't they also cut off people's hands and heads in Saudi Arabia?<br />A: That's different. Afghanistan was ruled by a tyrannical patriarchy that oppressed women and forced them to wear burqas whenever they  were in public, with death by stoning as the penalty for women who did not comply.<br /><br />Q: Don't Saudi women have to wear burqas in public,  too?<br />A: No, Saudi women merely wear a traditional Islamic body overing.<br /><br />Q: What's the difference?<br />A: The traditional Islamic co! vering worn by Saudi women is a modest yet fashionable garment that covers all of a woman's body xcept for her eyes and fingers. The burqa, on the other hand, is an evil tool of patriarchal oppression that covers all of a woman's body except for her eyes<br />and fingers.<br /><br />Q: It sounds like the same thing with a different  name.<br />A: Now, don't go comparing Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia. The Saudis are our friends.<br /><br />Q: But I thought you said 15 of the 19 hijackers on September 11th were from Saudi Arabia.<br />A: Yes, but they trained in Afghanistan.<br /><br />Q: Who trained them?<br />A: A very bad man named Osama bin Laden.<br /><br />Q: Was he from Afghanist! an?<br />A: Uh, no, he was from Saudi Arabia too. But he was a bad man, a very bad man.<br /><br />Q: I seem to recall he was our friend once.<br />A: Only when we helped him and the mujahadeen repel the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan back in the 1980s.<br /><br />Q: Who are the Soviets? Was that the Evil Communist Empire  Ronald Reagan talked about?<br />A: There are no more Soviets. The Soviet Union broke up in 1990 or there abouts, and now they have elections and capitalism like us. We call them Russians now.<br /><br />Q: So the Soviets, I mean, the Russians, are now our  friends?<br />A: Well, not really. You see, they were our friends for many years after they stopped being Soviets, bu t then they decided not to support our invasion of Iraq, so we're mad at them now. We're also mad at  the French and the Germans because they didn't help us invade Iraqe ither.<br /><br />Q: So the French and Germans are evil, too?<br />A: Not exactly evil, but just bad enough that we had to rename French fries and French toast to Freedom Fries and Freedom Toast.<br /><br />Q: Do we always rename foods whenever another country doesn't do what we want them to do?<br />A: No, we just do that to our friends. Our enemies, we  invade.<br /><br />Q: But wasn't Iraq one of our friends back in the  1980s?<br />A: Well, yeah. For a while.<br /><br />Q: Was Saddam Hussein ruler of Iraq back then?<br />A: Yes, but at the time he was fighting against Iran, which made him our friend, temporarily.<br /><br />Q: Why did that make him our friend?<br />A: Because at that time, Iran was our enemy.<br /><br />Q: Isn't that when he gassed the Kurds?<br />A: Yeah, but since he was fighting against Iran at the time, we looked the other way, to show him we were his friend.<br /><br />Q: So anyone who fights against one of our enemies automatically becomes our friend?<br />A: Most of the time, yes.<br /><br />Q: And anyone who fights against one of our friends is automatically an enemy?<br />A: Sometimes that's true, t! oo. However, if American corporations can profit by selling weapons to both sides at the same time, all  the better.<br /><br />Q: Why?<br />A: Because war is good for the economy, which meanswar is good for America. Also, since God is on America's side, anyone who opposes war is  a godless un-American Communist. Do you understand now why we attacked Iraq?<br /><br />Q: I think so. We attacked them because God wanted us to,r ight?<br />A: Yes.<br /><br />Q: But how did we know God wanted us to attack Iraq?<br />A: Well, you see, God personally speaks to George W. Bush and tells him what to do.<br /><br />Q: So basically, what you're saying is that we attacked Iraq because George W. Bush hears voices in his head?<br />A. Yes! You finally understand how the world works. Now close your eyes, make yourself comfortable, and go to sleep. Good night.<br /><br />Good night, Daddy.<br /></div></div>]]></body></post><post id="p13617" date="Posted: Sun Sep 28, 2003 6:00 am "><author>[sic]</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">That's great _shank.

It is Very difficult to positively identify the surface by just looking at it. So, how do we determine with any amount of certainty what type of mirror we are looking at? 
<br /><br />CONDUCT THIS SIMPLE TEST: Place the tip of your fingernail against the reflective surface and if there is a GAP between your fingernail and the image of the nail, then it is a GENUINE mirror. However, if your fingernail DIRECTLY TOUCHES the image of your nail, then BEWARE, IT IS A 2-WAY MIRROR! (there is someone seeing you from the other side).  The reason there is a gap on a real mirror, is because the silver is on the back of the mirror UNDER the glass. Whereas with a two-way mirror, the silver is on the surface. Keep it in mind! Make sure and check every time you enter in hotel rooms. May be someone is making a film on you.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p15645" date="Posted: Fri Nov 21, 2003 8:01 am "><author>Rayne</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">So basically, what you're saying is that we attacked Iraq because George W.

  <div class="quotecontent">The lizard brain<br /><br />Maybe you remember way back in school when you learned that the human brain still contains a prehistoric lizard brain at its center. This is the key to understanding women and what you can expect from them.<br /><br />Women still have direct contact with the lizard brain, something which men have been able to shut down about a trillion centuries ago.<br /><br />Have you ever noticed how women get cold very easily even if the temperature is only 1 µC below optimum? That's because lizards are cold-blooded, and a woman's lizard brain is telling her that she better get to a warm place quickly or her muscles will freeze up and her heart will stop beating.<br /><br />Have you noticed how a woman always seems to be thinking about two things at once? That's because a lizard's eyes point in two different directions, so it always has to process two completely different scenes.<br /><br />Have you noticed how two women can hate each other and have a serious fight, even if they don't know each other and they are sitting on opposite sides of the room? Lizards are very territorial and fight with each other by standing in one place and making threatening movements.<br /><br />Have you ever noticed how a woman drives? It's that two-direction eye problem again. That's why she thinks that it's possible to drive at high speed on a roundabout while looking in the mirror and adjusting her make-up.<br /><br />Have you noticed how a woman can sit somewhere completely happy, then suddenly out of nowhere she begins to cut you to pieces with her tongue? Well, just watch a lizard catch flies and you will know where that comes from.<br /><br />Women can lay in the sun on a big rock all day and never get bored.<br /><br />If a woman gets the chance, and she thinks that she can get away with it, she will color her hair orange and green and get it styled into a spiky hairdo. This is definitely a lizard haircut.<br /><br />I'm sure that there are hundreds of examples. The point is, the lizard brain theory explains everything. I am expecting to win the Nobel Prize this year.</div>

<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Hey,<br />This is a conversation between a father and a son...you will probably understand the reason why US attacked Iraq and how the world functions better after reading<br />this.<br /><br />Q: Daddy, why did we have to attack Iraq?<br />A: Because they had weapons of mass destruction,  honey.<br /><br />Q: But the inspectors didn't find any weapons of mass destruction.<br />A: That's because the Iraqis were hiding them.<br /><br />Q: And that's why we invaded Iraq?<br />A: Yep. Invasions always work better than  inspections.<br /><br />Q: But after we invaded them, we STILL didn't find any weapons  of mass destruction, did we?<br />A: That's because the weapons are so well hidden. Don't worry, we'll find something, probably right before the 2004 election.<br /><br />Q: Why did Iraq want all those weapons of mass  destruction?<br />A: To use them in a war, silly.<br /><br />Q: I'm confused. If they had all those weapons that they planned to use in a war, then why didn't they use any of those weapons when we  went to war with them?<br />A: Well, obviously they didn't want anyone to know they had  those weapons,so they chose to die by the thousands rather than defend themselves.<br /><br />Q: That doesn't make sense Daddy. Why would they choose to die  if they had all those big weapons to fight us back with?<br />A: It's a different culture. It's not supposed to make  sense.<br /><br />Q: I don't know about you, but I don't think they had any of those weapons our government said they did.<br />A: Well, you know, it doesn't matter whether or not they had those weapons. We had another good reason to invade them anyway.<br /><br />Q: And what was that?<br />A: Even if Iraq didn't have weapons of mass destruction, Saddam Hussein was a cruel dictator, which is another good reason to invade another country.<br /><br />Q: Why? What does a cruel dictator do that makes it OK to invade his country?<br />A: Well, for one thing, he tortured his own people.<br /><br />Q: Kind of like what they do in China?<br />A: Don't go comparing China to Iraq. China is a good economic competitor, where millions of people work for slave wages in sweatshops to make U.S. corporations richer.<br /><br />Q: So if a country lets its people be exploited for American corporate<br />gain, it's a good country, even if that country tortures people?<br />A: Right.<br /><br />Q: Why were people in Iraq being tortured?<br />A: For political crimes, mostly, like criticizing the  government. People who criticized the government in Iraq were sent to prison and tortured.<br /><br />Q: Isn't that exactly what happens in China?<br />A: I told you, China is different.<br /><br />Q: What's the difference between China and Iraq?<br />A: Well, for one thing, Iraq was ruled by the Ba'ath party, while China is Communist.<br /><br />Q: Didn't you once tell me Communists were bad?<br />A: No, just Cuban Communists are bad.<br /><br />Q: How are the Cuban Communists bad?<br />A: Well, for one thing, people who criticize the government in Cuba are sent to prison and tortured.<br /><br />Q: Like in Iraq?<br />A: Exactly.<br /><br />Q: And like in China, too?<br />A: I told you, China's a good economic competitor. Cuba, on the other hand, is not.<br /><br />Q: How come Cuba isn't a good economic competitor?<br />A: Well, you see, back in the early 1960s, our government passed some laws that made it illegal for Americans to trade or do any business with Cuba until they stopped being Communists and started being capitalists like us.<br /><br />Q: But if we got rid of those laws, opened up trade with Cuba,and started doing business with them, wouldn't that help the Cubans become capitalists?<br />A: Don't be a smart-ass.<br /><br />Q: I didn't think I was being one.<br />A: Well, anyway, they also don't have freedom of religion in Cuba.<br /><br />Q: Kind of like China and the @!#$ movement?<br />A: I told you, stop saying bad things about China. Anyway,  Saddam Hussein came to power through a military coup, so he's not really a legitimate leader anyway.<br /><br />Q: What's a military coup?<br />A: That's when a military general takes over the government of a country by force, instead of holding free elections like we do in the United States.<br /><br />Q: Didn't the ruler of Pakistan come to power by a military coup?<br />A: You mean General Pervez Musharraf? Uh, yeah, he did, but Pakistan is our friend.<br /><br />Q: Why is Pakistan our friend if their leader is illegitimate?<br />A: I never said Pervez Musharraf was illegitimate.<br /><br />Q: Didn't you just say a military general who comes to power by forcibly overthrowing the legitimate government of a nation is an illegitimate leader?<br />A: Only Saddam Hussein. Pervez Musharraf is our friend, because he helped us invade Afghanistan.<br /><br />Q: Why did we invade Afghanistan?<br />A: Because of what they did to us on September 11th.<br /><br />Q: What did Afghanistan do to us on September 11th?<br />A: Well, on September 11th, nineteen men, fifteen of them Saudi Arabians, hijacked four airplanes and flew three of them into buildings,killing over 3,000 Americans.<br /><br />Q: So how did Afghanistan figure into all that?<br />A: Afghanistan was where those bad men trained, under the oppressive rule of the Taliban.<br /><br />Q: Aren't the Taliban those bad radical Islamics who chopped off people's heads and hands?<br />A: Yes, that's exactly who they were. Not only did they chop off people's heads and hands, but they oppressed women, too.<br /><br />Q: Didn't the Bush administration giv e the Taliban 43 million dollars back in May of 2001?<br />A: Yes, but that money was a reward because they did such a good job fighting drugs.<br /><br />Q: Fighting drugs?<br />A: Yes, the Taliban were very helpful in stopping people from growing opium poppies.<br /><br />Q: How did they do such a good job?<br />A: Simple. If people were caught growing opium poppies, the Taliban would have their hands and heads cut off.<br /><br />Q: So, when the Taliban cut off people's heads and hands for growing flowers, that was OK, but not if they cut people's heads and hands off for other reasons?<br />A: Yes. It's OK with us if radical Islamic fundamentalists cut off people's hands for growing flowers, but it's cruel if they cut off people's hands for stealing bread.<br /><br />Q: Don't they also cut off people's hands and heads in Saudi Arabia?<br />A: That's different. Afghanistan was ruled by a tyrannical patriarchy that oppressed women and forced them to wear burqas whenever they  were in public, with death by stoning as the penalty for women who did not comply.<br /><br />Q: Don't Saudi women have to wear burqas in public,  too?<br />A: No, Saudi women merely wear a traditional Islamic body overing.<br /><br />Q: What's the difference?<br />A: The traditional Islamic co! vering worn by Saudi women is a modest yet fashionable garment that covers all of a woman's body xcept for her eyes and fingers. The burqa, on the other hand, is an evil tool of patriarchal oppression that covers all of a woman's body except for her eyes<br />and fingers.<br /><br />Q: It sounds like the same thing with a different  name.<br />A: Now, don't go comparing Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia. The Saudis are our friends.<br /><br />Q: But I thought you said 15 of the 19 hijackers on September 11th were from Saudi Arabia.<br />A: Yes, but they trained in Afghanistan.<br /><br />Q: Who trained them?<br />A: A very bad man named Osama bin Laden.<br /><br />Q: Was he from Afghanist! an?<br />A: Uh, no, he was from Saudi Arabia too. But he was a bad man, a very bad man.<br /><br />Q: I seem to recall he was our friend once.<br />A: Only when we helped him and the mujahadeen repel the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan back in the 1980s.<br /><br />Q: Who are the Soviets? Was that the Evil Communist Empire  Ronald Reagan talked about?<br />A: There are no more Soviets. The Soviet Union broke up in 1990 or there abouts, and now they have elections and capitalism like us. We call them Russians now.<br /><br />Q: So the Soviets, I mean, the Russians, are now our  friends?<br />A: Well, not really. You see, they were our friends for many years after they stopped being Soviets, bu t then they decided not to support our invasion of Iraq, so we're mad at them now. We're also mad at  the French and the Germans because they didn't help us invade Iraqe ither.<br /><br />Q: So the French and Germans are evil, too?<br />A: Not exactly evil, but just bad enough that we had to rename French fries and French toast to Freedom Fries and Freedom Toast.<br /><br />Q: Do we always rename foods whenever another country doesn't do what we want them to do?<br />A: No, we just do that to our friends. Our enemies, we  invade.<br /><br />Q: But wasn't Iraq one of our friends back in the  1980s?<br />A: Well, yeah. For a while.<br /><br />Q: Was Saddam Hussein ruler of Iraq back then?<br />A: Yes, but at the time he was fighting against Iran, which made him our friend, temporarily.<br /><br />Q: Why did that make him our friend?<br />A: Because at that time, Iran was our enemy.<br /><br />Q: Isn't that when he gassed the Kurds?<br />A: Yeah, but since he was fighting against Iran at the time, we looked the other way, to show him we were his friend.<br /><br />Q: So anyone who fights against one of our enemies automatically becomes our friend?<br />A: Most of the time, yes.<br /><br />Q: And anyone who fights against one of our friends is automatically an enemy?<br />A: Sometimes that's true, t! oo. However, if American corporations can profit by selling weapons to both sides at the same time, all  the better.<br /><br />Q: Why?<br />A: Because war is good for the economy, which meanswar is good for America. Also, since God is on America's side, anyone who opposes war is  a godless un-American Communist. Do you understand now why we attacked Iraq?<br /><br />Q: I think so. We attacked them because God wanted us to,r ight?<br />A: Yes.<br /><br />Q: But how did we know God wanted us to attack Iraq?<br />A: Well, you see, God personally speaks to George W. Bush and tells him what to do.<br /><br />Q: So basically, what you're saying is that we attacked Iraq because George W. Bush hears voices in his head?<br />A. Yes! You finally understand how the world works. Now close your eyes, make yourself comfortable, and go to sleep. Good night.<br /><br />Good night, Daddy.<br /></div></div>]]></body></post><post id="p13617" date="Posted: Sun Sep 28, 2003 6:00 am "><author>[sic]</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">That's great _shank.

It is Very difficult to positively identify the surface by just looking at it. So, how do we determine with any amount of certainty what type of mirror we are looking at? 
<br /><br />CONDUCT THIS SIMPLE TEST: Place the tip of your fingernail against the reflective surface and if there is a GAP between your fingernail and the image of the nail, then it is a GENUINE mirror. However, if your fingernail DIRECTLY TOUCHES the image of your nail, then BEWARE, IT IS A 2-WAY MIRROR! (there is someone seeing you from the other side).  The reason there is a gap on a real mirror, is because the silver is on the back of the mirror UNDER the glass. Whereas with a two-way mirror, the silver is on the surface. Keep it in mind! Make sure and check every time you enter in hotel rooms. May be someone is making a film on you.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p15645" date="Posted: Fri Nov 21, 2003 8:01 am "><author>Rayne</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">So basically, what you're saying is that we attacked Iraq because George W.

  <div class="quotecontent">The lizard brain<br /><br />Maybe you remember way back in school when you learned that the human brain still contains a prehistoric lizard brain at its center. This is the key to understanding women and what you can expect from them.<br /><br />Women still have direct contact with the lizard brain, something which men have been able to shut down about a trillion centuries ago.<br /><br />Have you ever noticed how women get cold very easily even if the temperature is only 1 µC below optimum? That's because lizards are cold-blooded, and a woman's lizard brain is telling her that she better get to a warm place quickly or her muscles will freeze up and her heart will stop beating.<br /><br />Have you noticed how a woman always seems to be thinking about two things at once? That's because a lizard's eyes point in two different directions, so it always has to process two completely different scenes.<br /><br />Have you noticed how two women can hate each other and have a serious fight, even if they don't know each other and they are sitting on opposite sides of the room? Lizards are very territorial and fight with each other by standing in one place and making threatening movements.<br /><br />Have you ever noticed how a woman drives? It's that two-direction eye problem again. That's why she thinks that it's possible to drive at high speed on a roundabout while looking in the mirror and adjusting her make-up.<br /><br />Have you noticed how a woman can sit somewhere completely happy, then suddenly out of nowhere she begins to cut you to pieces with her tongue? Well, just watch a lizard catch flies and you will know where that comes from.<br /><br />Women can lay in the sun on a big rock all day and never get bored.<br /><br />If a woman gets the chance, and she thinks that she can get away with it, she will color her hair orange and green and get it styled into a spiky hairdo. This is definitely a lizard haircut.<br /><br />I'm sure that there are hundreds of examples. The point is, the lizard brain theory explains everything. I am expecting to win the Nobel Prize this year.</div>

<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Hey,<br />This is a conversation between a father and a son...you will probably understand the reason why US attacked Iraq and how the world functions better after reading<br />this.<br /><br />Q: Daddy, why did we have to attack Iraq?<br />A: Because they had weapons of mass destruction,  honey.<br /><br />Q: But the inspectors didn't find any weapons of mass destruction.<br />A: That's because the Iraqis were hiding them.<br /><br />Q: And that's why we invaded Iraq?<br />A: Yep. Invasions always work better than  inspections.<br /><br />Q: But after we invaded them, we STILL didn't find any weapons  of mass destruction, did we?<br />A: That's because the weapons are so well hidden. Don't worry, we'll find something, probably right before the 2004 election.<br /><br />Q: Why did Iraq want all those weapons of mass  destruction?<br />A: To use them in a war, silly.<br /><br />Q: I'm confused. If they had all those weapons that they planned to use in a war, then why didn't they use any of those weapons when we  went to war with them?<br />A: Well, obviously they didn't want anyone to know they had  those weapons,so they chose to die by the thousands rather than defend themselves.<br /><br />Q: That doesn't make sense Daddy. Why would they choose to die  if they had all those big weapons to fight us back with?<br />A: It's a different culture. It's not supposed to make  sense.<br /><br />Q: I don't know about you, but I don't think they had any of those weapons our government said they did.<br />A: Well, you know, it doesn't matter whether or not they had those weapons. We had another good reason to invade them anyway.<br /><br />Q: And what was that?<br />A: Even if Iraq didn't have weapons of mass destruction, Saddam Hussein was a cruel dictator, which is another good reason to invade another country.<br /><br />Q: Why? What does a cruel dictator do that makes it OK to invade his country?<br />A: Well, for one thing, he tortured his own people.<br /><br />Q: Kind of like what they do in China?<br />A: Don't go comparing China to Iraq. China is a good economic competitor, where millions of people work for slave wages in sweatshops to make U.S. corporations richer.<br /><br />Q: So if a country lets its people be exploited for American corporate<br />gain, it's a good country, even if that country tortures people?<br />A: Right.<br /><br />Q: Why were people in Iraq being tortured?<br />A: For political crimes, mostly, like criticizing the  government. People who criticized the government in Iraq were sent to prison and tortured.<br /><br />Q: Isn't that exactly what happens in China?<br />A: I told you, China is different.<br /><br />Q: What's the difference between China and Iraq?<br />A: Well, for one thing, Iraq was ruled by the Ba'ath party, while China is Communist.<br /><br />Q: Didn't you once tell me Communists were bad?<br />A: No, just Cuban Communists are bad.<br /><br />Q: How are the Cuban Communists bad?<br />A: Well, for one thing, people who criticize the government in Cuba are sent to prison and tortured.<br /><br />Q: Like in Iraq?<br />A: Exactly.<br /><br />Q: And like in China, too?<br />A: I told you, China's a good economic competitor. Cuba, on the other hand, is not.<br /><br />Q: How come Cuba isn't a good economic competitor?<br />A: Well, you see, back in the early 1960s, our government passed some laws that made it illegal for Americans to trade or do any business with Cuba until they stopped being Communists and started being capitalists like us.<br /><br />Q: But if we got rid of those laws, opened up trade with Cuba,and started doing business with them, wouldn't that help the Cubans become capitalists?<br />A: Don't be a smart-ass.<br /><br />Q: I didn't think I was being one.<br />A: Well, anyway, they also don't have freedom of religion in Cuba.<br /><br />Q: Kind of like China and the @!#$ movement?<br />A: I told you, stop saying bad things about China. Anyway,  Saddam Hussein came to power through a military coup, so he's not really a legitimate leader anyway.<br /><br />Q: What's a military coup?<br />A: That's when a military general takes over the government of a country by force, instead of holding free elections like we do in the United States.<br /><br />Q: Didn't the ruler of Pakistan come to power by a military coup?<br />A: You mean General Pervez Musharraf? Uh, yeah, he did, but Pakistan is our friend.<br /><br />Q: Why is Pakistan our friend if their leader is illegitimate?<br />A: I never said Pervez Musharraf was illegitimate.<br /><br />Q: Didn't you just say a military general who comes to power by forcibly overthrowing the legitimate government of a nation is an illegitimate leader?<br />A: Only Saddam Hussein. Pervez Musharraf is our friend, because he helped us invade Afghanistan.<br /><br />Q: Why did we invade Afghanistan?<br />A: Because of what they did to us on September 11th.<br /><br />Q: What did Afghanistan do to us on September 11th?<br />A: Well, on September 11th, nineteen men, fifteen of them Saudi Arabians, hijacked four airplanes and flew three of them into buildings,killing over 3,000 Americans.<br /><br />Q: So how did Afghanistan figure into all that?<br />A: Afghanistan was where those bad men trained, under the oppressive rule of the Taliban.<br /><br />Q: Aren't the Taliban those bad radical Islamics who chopped off people's heads and hands?<br />A: Yes, that's exactly who they were. Not only did they chop off people's heads and hands, but they oppressed women, too.<br /><br />Q: Didn't the Bush administration giv e the Taliban 43 million dollars back in May of 2001?<br />A: Yes, but that money was a reward because they did such a good job fighting drugs.<br /><br />Q: Fighting drugs?<br />A: Yes, the Taliban were very helpful in stopping people from growing opium poppies.<br /><br />Q: How did they do such a good job?<br />A: Simple. If people were caught growing opium poppies, the Taliban would have their hands and heads cut off.<br /><br />Q: So, when the Taliban cut off people's heads and hands for growing flowers, that was OK, but not if they cut people's heads and hands off for other reasons?<br />A: Yes. It's OK with us if radical Islamic fundamentalists cut off people's hands for growing flowers, but it's cruel if they cut off people's hands for stealing bread.<br /><br />Q: Don't they also cut off people's hands and heads in Saudi Arabia?<br />A: That's different. Afghanistan was ruled by a tyrannical patriarchy that oppressed women and forced them to wear burqas whenever they  were in public, with death by stoning as the penalty for women who did not comply.<br /><br />Q: Don't Saudi women have to wear burqas in public,  too?<br />A: No, Saudi women merely wear a traditional Islamic body overing.<br /><br />Q: What's the difference?<br />A: The traditional Islamic co! vering worn by Saudi women is a modest yet fashionable garment that covers all of a woman's body xcept for her eyes and fingers. The burqa, on the other hand, is an evil tool of patriarchal oppression that covers all of a woman's body except for her eyes<br />and fingers.<br /><br />Q: It sounds like the same thing with a different  name.<br />A: Now, don't go comparing Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia. The Saudis are our friends.<br /><br />Q: But I thought you said 15 of the 19 hijackers on September 11th were from Saudi Arabia.<br />A: Yes, but they trained in Afghanistan.<br /><br />Q: Who trained them?<br />A: A very bad man named Osama bin Laden.<br /><br />Q: Was he from Afghanist! an?<br />A: Uh, no, he was from Saudi Arabia too. But he was a bad man, a very bad man.<br /><br />Q: I seem to recall he was our friend once.<br />A: Only when we helped him and the mujahadeen repel the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan back in the 1980s.<br /><br />Q: Who are the Soviets? Was that the Evil Communist Empire  Ronald Reagan talked about?<br />A: There are no more Soviets. The Soviet Union broke up in 1990 or there abouts, and now they have elections and capitalism like us. We call them Russians now.<br /><br />Q: So the Soviets, I mean, the Russians, are now our  friends?<br />A: Well, not really. You see, they were our friends for many years after they stopped being Soviets, bu t then they decided not to support our invasion of Iraq, so we're mad at them now. We're also mad at  the French and the Germans because they didn't help us invade Iraqe ither.<br /><br />Q: So the French and Germans are evil, too?<br />A: Not exactly evil, but just bad enough that we had to rename French fries and French toast to Freedom Fries and Freedom Toast.<br /><br />Q: Do we always rename foods whenever another country doesn't do what we want them to do?<br />A: No, we just do that to our friends. Our enemies, we  invade.<br /><br />Q: But wasn't Iraq one of our friends back in the  1980s?<br />A: Well, yeah. For a while.<br /><br />Q: Was Saddam Hussein ruler of Iraq back then?<br />A: Yes, but at the time he was fighting against Iran, which made him our friend, temporarily.<br /><br />Q: Why did that make him our friend?<br />A: Because at that time, Iran was our enemy.<br /><br />Q: Isn't that when he gassed the Kurds?<br />A: Yeah, but since he was fighting against Iran at the time, we looked the other way, to show him we were his friend.<br /><br />Q: So anyone who fights against one of our enemies automatically becomes our friend?<br />A: Most of the time, yes.<br /><br />Q: And anyone who fights against one of our friends is automatically an enemy?<br />A: Sometimes that's true, t! oo. However, if American corporations can profit by selling weapons to both sides at the same time, all  the better.<br /><br />Q: Why?<br />A: Because war is good for the economy, which meanswar is good for America. Also, since God is on America's side, anyone who opposes war is  a godless un-American Communist. Do you understand now why we attacked Iraq?<br /><br />Q: I think so. We attacked them because God wanted us to,r ight?<br />A: Yes.<br /><br />Q: But how did we know God wanted us to attack Iraq?<br />A: Well, you see, God personally speaks to George W. Bush and tells him what to do.<br /><br />Q: So basically, what you're saying is that we attacked Iraq because George W. Bush hears voices in his head?<br />A. Yes! You finally understand how the world works. Now close your eyes, make yourself comfortable, and go to sleep. Good night.<br /><br />Good night, Daddy.<br /></div></div>]]></body></post><post id="p13617" date="Posted: Sun Sep 28, 2003 6:00 am "><author>[sic]</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">That's great _shank.

It is Very difficult to positively identify the surface by just looking at it. So, how do we determine with any amount of certainty what type of mirror we are looking at? 
<br /><br />CONDUCT THIS SIMPLE TEST: Place the tip of your fingernail against the reflective surface and if there is a GAP between your fingernail and the image of the nail, then it is a GENUINE mirror. However, if your fingernail DIRECTLY TOUCHES the image of your nail, then BEWARE, IT IS A 2-WAY MIRROR! (there is someone seeing you from the other side).  The reason there is a gap on a real mirror, is because the silver is on the back of the mirror UNDER the glass. Whereas with a two-way mirror, the silver is on the surface. Keep it in mind! Make sure and check every time you enter in hotel rooms. May be someone is making a film on you.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p15645" date="Posted: Fri Nov 21, 2003 8:01 am "><author>Rayne</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">So basically, what you're saying is that we attacked Iraq because George W.

  <div class="quotecontent">The lizard brain<br /><br />Maybe you remember way back in school when you learned that the human brain still contains a prehistoric lizard brain at its center. This is the key to understanding women and what you can expect from them.<br /><br />Women still have direct contact with the lizard brain, something which men have been able to shut down about a trillion centuries ago.<br /><br />Have you ever noticed how women get cold very easily even if the temperature is only 1 µC below optimum? That's because lizards are cold-blooded, and a woman's lizard brain is telling her that she better get to a warm place quickly or her muscles will freeze up and her heart will stop beating.<br /><br />Have you noticed how a woman always seems to be thinking about two things at once? That's because a lizard's eyes point in two different directions, so it always has to process two completely different scenes.<br /><br />Have you noticed how two women can hate each other and have a serious fight, even if they don't know each other and they are sitting on opposite sides of the room? Lizards are very territorial and fight with each other by standing in one place and making threatening movements.<br /><br />Have you ever noticed how a woman drives? It's that two-direction eye problem again. That's why she thinks that it's possible to drive at high speed on a roundabout while looking in the mirror and adjusting her make-up.<br /><br />Have you noticed how a woman can sit somewhere completely happy, then suddenly out of nowhere she begins to cut you to pieces with her tongue? Well, just watch a lizard catch flies and you will know where that comes from.<br /><br />Women can lay in the sun on a big rock all day and never get bored.<br /><br />If a woman gets the chance, and she thinks that she can get away with it, she will color her hair orange and green and get it styled into a spiky hairdo. This is definitely a lizard haircut.<br /><br />I'm sure that there are hundreds of examples. The point is, the lizard brain theory explains everything. I am expecting to win the Nobel Prize this year.</div>

<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Hey,<br />This is a conversation between a father and a son...you will probably understand the reason why US attacked Iraq and how the world functions better after reading<br />this.<br /><br />Q: Daddy, why did we have to attack Iraq?<br />A: Because they had weapons of mass destruction,  honey.<br /><br />Q: But the inspectors didn't find any weapons of mass destruction.<br />A: That's because the Iraqis were hiding them.<br /><br />Q: And that's why we invaded Iraq?<br />A: Yep. Invasions always work better than  inspections.<br /><br />Q: But after we invaded them, we STILL didn't find any weapons  of mass destruction, did we?<br />A: That's because the weapons are so well hidden. Don't worry, we'll find something, probably right before the 2004 election.<br /><br />Q: Why did Iraq want all those weapons of mass  destruction?<br />A: To use them in a war, silly.<br /><br />Q: I'm confused. If they had all those weapons that they planned to use in a war, then why didn't they use any of those weapons when we  went to war with them?<br />A: Well, obviously they didn't want anyone to know they had  those weapons,so they chose to die by the thousands rather than defend themselves.<br /><br />Q: That doesn't make sense Daddy. Why would they choose to die  if they had all those big weapons to fight us back with?<br />A: It's a different culture. It's not supposed to make  sense.<br /><br />Q: I don't know about you, but I don't think they had any of those weapons our government said they did.<br />A: Well, you know, it doesn't matter whether or not they had those weapons. We had another good reason to invade them anyway.<br /><br />Q: And what was that?<br />A: Even if Iraq didn't have weapons of mass destruction, Saddam Hussein was a cruel dictator, which is another good reason to invade another country.<br /><br />Q: Why? What does a cruel dictator do that makes it OK to invade his country?<br />A: Well, for one thing, he tortured his own people.<br /><br />Q: Kind of like what they do in China?<br />A: Don't go comparing China to Iraq. China is a good economic competitor, where millions of people work for slave wages in sweatshops to make U.S. corporations richer.<br /><br />Q: So if a country lets its people be exploited for American corporate<br />gain, it's a good country, even if that country tortures people?<br />A: Right.<br /><br />Q: Why were people in Iraq being tortured?<br />A: For political crimes, mostly, like criticizing the  government. People who criticized the government in Iraq were sent to prison and tortured.<br /><br />Q: Isn't that exactly what happens in China?<br />A: I told you, China is different.<br /><br />Q: What's the difference between China and Iraq?<br />A: Well, for one thing, Iraq was ruled by the Ba'ath party, while China is Communist.<br /><br />Q: Didn't you once tell me Communists were bad?<br />A: No, just Cuban Communists are bad.<br /><br />Q: How are the Cuban Communists bad?<br />A: Well, for one thing, people who criticize the government in Cuba are sent to prison and tortured.<br /><br />Q: Like in Iraq?<br />A: Exactly.<br /><br />Q: And like in China, too?<br />A: I told you, China's a good economic competitor. Cuba, on the other hand, is not.<br /><br />Q: How come Cuba isn't a good economic competitor?<br />A: Well, you see, back in the early 1960s, our government passed some laws that made it illegal for Americans to trade or do any business with Cuba until they stopped being Communists and started being capitalists like us.<br /><br />Q: But if we got rid of those laws, opened up trade with Cuba,and started doing business with them, wouldn't that help the Cubans become capitalists?<br />A: Don't be a smart-ass.<br /><br />Q: I didn't think I was being one.<br />A: Well, anyway, they also don't have freedom of religion in Cuba.<br /><br />Q: Kind of like China and the @!#$ movement?<br />A: I told you, stop saying bad things about China. Anyway,  Saddam Hussein came to power through a military coup, so he's not really a legitimate leader anyway.<br /><br />Q: What's a military coup?<br />A: That's when a military general takes over the government of a country by force, instead of holding free elections like we do in the United States.<br /><br />Q: Didn't the ruler of Pakistan come to power by a military coup?<br />A: You mean General Pervez Musharraf? Uh, yeah, he did, but Pakistan is our friend.<br /><br />Q: Why is Pakistan our friend if their leader is illegitimate?<br />A: I never said Pervez Musharraf was illegitimate.<br /><br />Q: Didn't you just say a military general who comes to power by forcibly overthrowing the legitimate government of a nation is an illegitimate leader?<br />A: Only Saddam Hussein. Pervez Musharraf is our friend, because he helped us invade Afghanistan.<br /><br />Q: Why did we invade Afghanistan?<br />A: Because of what they did to us on September 11th.<br /><br />Q: What did Afghanistan do to us on September 11th?<br />A: Well, on September 11th, nineteen men, fifteen of them Saudi Arabians, hijacked four airplanes and flew three of them into buildings,killing over 3,000 Americans.<br /><br />Q: So how did Afghanistan figure into all that?<br />A: Afghanistan was where those bad men trained, under the oppressive rule of the Taliban.<br /><br />Q: Aren't the Taliban those bad radical Islamics who chopped off people's heads and hands?<br />A: Yes, that's exactly who they were. Not only did they chop off people's heads and hands, but they oppressed women, too.<br /><br />Q: Didn't the Bush administration giv e the Taliban 43 million dollars back in May of 2001?<br />A: Yes, but that money was a reward because they did such a good job fighting drugs.<br /><br />Q: Fighting drugs?<br />A: Yes, the Taliban were very helpful in stopping people from growing opium poppies.<br /><br />Q: How did they do such a good job?<br />A: Simple. If people were caught growing opium poppies, the Taliban would have their hands and heads cut off.<br /><br />Q: So, when the Taliban cut off people's heads and hands for growing flowers, that was OK, but not if they cut people's heads and hands off for other reasons?<br />A: Yes. It's OK with us if radical Islamic fundamentalists cut off people's hands for growing flowers, but it's cruel if they cut off people's hands for stealing bread.<br /><br />Q: Don't they also cut off people's hands and heads in Saudi Arabia?<br />A: That's different. Afghanistan was ruled by a tyrannical patriarchy that oppressed women and forced them to wear burqas whenever they  were in public, with death by stoning as the penalty for women who did not comply.<br /><br />Q: Don't Saudi women have to wear burqas in public,  too?<br />A: No, Saudi women merely wear a traditional Islamic body overing.<br /><br />Q: What's the difference?<br />A: The traditional Islamic co! vering worn by Saudi women is a modest yet fashionable garment that covers all of a woman's body xcept for her eyes and fingers. The burqa, on the other hand, is an evil tool of patriarchal oppression that covers all of a woman's body except for her eyes<br />and fingers.<br /><br />Q: It sounds like the same thing with a different  name.<br />A: Now, don't go comparing Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia. The Saudis are our friends.<br /><br />Q: But I thought you said 15 of the 19 hijackers on September 11th were from Saudi Arabia.<br />A: Yes, but they trained in Afghanistan.<br /><br />Q: Who trained them?<br />A: A very bad man named Osama bin Laden.<br /><br />Q: Was he from Afghanist! an?<br />A: Uh, no, he was from Saudi Arabia too. But he was a bad man, a very bad man.<br /><br />Q: I seem to recall he was our friend once.<br />A: Only when we helped him and the mujahadeen repel the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan back in the 1980s.<br /><br />Q: Who are the Soviets? Was that the Evil Communist Empire  Ronald Reagan talked about?<br />A: There are no more Soviets. The Soviet Union broke up in 1990 or there abouts, and now they have elections and capitalism like us. We call them Russians now.<br /><br />Q: So the Soviets, I mean, the Russians, are now our  friends?<br />A: Well, not really. You see, they were our friends for many years after they stopped being Soviets, bu t then they decided not to support our invasion of Iraq, so we're mad at them now. We're also mad at  the French and the Germans because they didn't help us invade Iraqe ither.<br /><br />Q: So the French and Germans are evil, too?<br />A: Not exactly evil, but just bad enough that we had to rename French fries and French toast to Freedom Fries and Freedom Toast.<br /><br />Q: Do we always rename foods whenever another country doesn't do what we want them to do?<br />A: No, we just do that to our friends. Our enemies, we  invade.<br /><br />Q: But wasn't Iraq one of our friends back in the  1980s?<br />A: Well, yeah. For a while.<br /><br />Q: Was Saddam Hussein ruler of Iraq back then?<br />A: Yes, but at the time he was fighting against Iran, which made him our friend, temporarily.<br /><br />Q: Why did that make him our friend?<br />A: Because at that time, Iran was our enemy.<br /><br />Q: Isn't that when he gassed the Kurds?<br />A: Yeah, but since he was fighting against Iran at the time, we looked the other way, to show him we were his friend.<br /><br />Q: So anyone who fights against one of our enemies automatically becomes our friend?<br />A: Most of the time, yes.<br /><br />Q: And anyone who fights against one of our friends is automatically an enemy?<br />A: Sometimes that's true, t! oo. However, if American corporations can profit by selling weapons to both sides at the same time, all  the better.<br /><br />Q: Why?<br />A: Because war is good for the economy, which meanswar is good for America. Also, since God is on America's side, anyone who opposes war is  a godless un-American Communist. Do you understand now why we attacked Iraq?<br /><br />Q: I think so. We attacked them because God wanted us to,r ight?<br />A: Yes.<br /><br />Q: But how did we know God wanted us to attack Iraq?<br />A: Well, you see, God personally speaks to George W. Bush and tells him what to do.<br /><br />Q: So basically, what you're saying is that we attacked Iraq because George W. Bush hears voices in his head?<br />A. Yes! You finally understand how the world works. Now close your eyes, make yourself comfortable, and go to sleep.

<br /><br />CONDUCT THIS SIMPLE TEST: Place the tip of your fingernail against the reflective surface and if there is a GAP between your fingernail and the image of the nail, then it is a GENUINE mirror. However, if your fingernail DIRECTLY TOUCHES the image of your nail, then BEWARE, IT IS A 2-WAY MIRROR! (there is someone seeing you from the other side).  The reason there is a gap on a real mirror, is because the silver is on the back of the mirror UNDER the glass. Whereas with a two-way mirror, the silver is on the surface. Keep it in mind! Make sure and check every time you enter in hotel rooms.

  <div class="quotecontent">The lizard brain<br /><br />Maybe you remember way back in school when you learned that the human brain still contains a prehistoric lizard brain at its center. This is the key to understanding women and what you can expect from them.<br /><br />Women still have direct contact with the lizard brain, something which men have been able to shut down about a trillion centuries ago.<br /><br />Have you ever noticed how women get cold very easily even if the temperature is only 1 µC below optimum? That's because lizards are cold-blooded, and a woman's lizard brain is telling her that she better get to a warm place quickly or her muscles will freeze up and her heart will stop beating.<br /><br />Have you noticed how a woman always seems to be thinking about two things at once? That's because a lizard's eyes point in two different directions, so it always has to process two completely different scenes.<br /><br />Have you noticed how two women can hate each other and have a serious fight, even if they don't know each other and they are sitting on opposite sides of the room? Lizards are very territorial and fight with each other by standing in one place and making threatening movements.<br /><br />Have you ever noticed how a woman drives? It's that two-direction eye problem again. That's why she thinks that it's possible to drive at high speed on a roundabout while looking in the mirror and adjusting her make-up.<br /><br />Have you noticed how a woman can sit somewhere completely happy, then suddenly out of nowhere she begins to cut you to pieces with her tongue? Well, just watch a lizard catch flies and you will know where that comes from.<br /><br />Women can lay in the sun on a big rock all day and never get bored.<br /><br />If a woman gets the chance, and she thinks that she can get away with it, she will color her hair orange and green and get it styled into a spiky hairdo. This is definitely a lizard haircut.<br /><br />I'm sure that there are hundreds of examples. The point is, the lizard brain theory explains everything. I am expecting to win the Nobel Prize this year.</div>

<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Hey,<br />This is a conversation between a father and a son...you will probably understand the reason why US attacked Iraq and how the world functions better after reading<br />this.<br /><br />Q: Daddy, why did we have to attack Iraq?<br />A: Because they had weapons of mass destruction,  honey.<br /><br />Q: But the inspectors didn't find any weapons of mass destruction.<br />A: That's because the Iraqis were hiding them.<br /><br />Q: And that's why we invaded Iraq?<br />A: Yep. Invasions always work better than  inspections.<br /><br />Q: But after we invaded them, we STILL didn't find any weapons  of mass destruction, did we?<br />A: That's because the weapons are so well hidden. Don't worry, we'll find something, probably right before the 2004 election.<br /><br />Q: Why did Iraq want all those weapons of mass  destruction?<br />A: To use them in a war, silly.<br /><br />Q: I'm confused. If they had all those weapons that they planned to use in a war, then why didn't they use any of those weapons when we  went to war with them?<br />A: Well, obviously they didn't want anyone to know they had  those weapons,so they chose to die by the thousands rather than defend themselves.<br /><br />Q: That doesn't make sense Daddy. Why would they choose to die  if they had all those big weapons to fight us back with?<br />A: It's a different culture. It's not supposed to make  sense.<br /><br />Q: I don't know about you, but I don't think they had any of those weapons our government said they did.<br />A: Well, you know, it doesn't matter whether or not they had those weapons. We had another good reason to invade them anyway.<br /><br />Q: And what was that?<br />A: Even if Iraq didn't have weapons of mass destruction, Saddam Hussein was a cruel dictator, which is another good reason to invade another country.<br /><br />Q: Why? What does a cruel dictator do that makes it OK to invade his country?<br />A: Well, for one thing, he tortured his own people.<br /><br />Q: Kind of like what they do in China?<br />A: Don't go comparing China to Iraq. China is a good economic competitor, where millions of people work for slave wages in sweatshops to make U.S. corporations richer.<br /><br />Q: So if a country lets its people be exploited for American corporate<br />gain, it's a good country, even if that country tortures people?<br />A: Right.<br /><br />Q: Why were people in Iraq being tortured?<br />A: For political crimes, mostly, like criticizing the  government. People who criticized the government in Iraq were sent to prison and tortured.<br /><br />Q: Isn't that exactly what happens in China?<br />A: I told you, China is different.<br /><br />Q: What's the difference between China and Iraq?<br />A: Well, for one thing, Iraq was ruled by the Ba'ath party, while China is Communist.<br /><br />Q: Didn't you once tell me Communists were bad?<br />A: No, just Cuban Communists are bad.<br /><br />Q: How are the Cuban Communists bad?<br />A: Well, for one thing, people who criticize the government in Cuba are sent to prison and tortured.<br /><br />Q: Like in Iraq?<br />A: Exactly.<br /><br />Q: And like in China, too?<br />A: I told you, China's a good economic competitor. Cuba, on the other hand, is not.<br /><br />Q: How come Cuba isn't a good economic competitor?<br />A: Well, you see, back in the early 1960s, our government passed some laws that made it illegal for Americans to trade or do any business with Cuba until they stopped being Communists and started being capitalists like us.<br /><br />Q: But if we got rid of those laws, opened up trade with Cuba,and started doing business with them, wouldn't that help the Cubans become capitalists?<br />A: Don't be a smart-ass.<br /><br />Q: I didn't think I was being one.<br />A: Well, anyway, they also don't have freedom of religion in Cuba.<br /><br />Q: Kind of like China and the @!#$ movement?<br />A: I told you, stop saying bad things about China. Anyway,  Saddam Hussein came to power through a military coup, so he's not really a legitimate leader anyway.<br /><br />Q: What's a military coup?<br />A: That's when a military general takes over the government of a country by force, instead of holding free elections like we do in the United States.<br /><br />Q: Didn't the ruler of Pakistan come to power by a military coup?<br />A: You mean General Pervez Musharraf? Uh, yeah, he did, but Pakistan is our friend.<br /><br />Q: Why is Pakistan our friend if their leader is illegitimate?<br />A: I never said Pervez Musharraf was illegitimate.<br /><br />Q: Didn't you just say a military general who comes to power by forcibly overthrowing the legitimate government of a nation is an illegitimate leader?<br />A: Only Saddam Hussein. Pervez Musharraf is our friend, because he helped us invade Afghanistan.<br /><br />Q: Why did we invade Afghanistan?<br />A: Because of what they did to us on September 11th.<br /><br />Q: What did Afghanistan do to us on September 11th?<br />A: Well, on September 11th, nineteen men, fifteen of them Saudi Arabians, hijacked four airplanes and flew three of them into buildings,killing over 3,000 Americans.<br /><br />Q: So how did Afghanistan figure into all that?<br />A: Afghanistan was where those bad men trained, under the oppressive rule of the Taliban.<br /><br />Q: Aren't the Taliban those bad radical Islamics who chopped off people's heads and hands?<br />A: Yes, that's exactly who they were. Not only did they chop off people's heads and hands, but they oppressed women, too.<br /><br />Q: Didn't the Bush administration giv e the Taliban 43 million dollars back in May of 2001?<br />A: Yes, but that money was a reward because they did such a good job fighting drugs.<br /><br />Q: Fighting drugs?<br />A: Yes, the Taliban were very helpful in stopping people from growing opium poppies.<br /><br />Q: How did they do such a good job?<br />A: Simple. If people were caught growing opium poppies, the Taliban would have their hands and heads cut off.<br /><br />Q: So, when the Taliban cut off people's heads and hands for growing flowers, that was OK, but not if they cut people's heads and hands off for other reasons?<br />A: Yes. It's OK with us if radical Islamic fundamentalists cut off people's hands for growing flowers, but it's cruel if they cut off people's hands for stealing bread.<br /><br />Q: Don't they also cut off people's hands and heads in Saudi Arabia?<br />A: That's different. Afghanistan was ruled by a tyrannical patriarchy that oppressed women and forced them to wear burqas whenever they  were in public, with death by stoning as the penalty for women who did not comply.<br /><br />Q: Don't Saudi women have to wear burqas in public,  too?<br />A: No, Saudi women merely wear a traditional Islamic body overing.<br /><br />Q: What's the difference?<br />A: The traditional Islamic co! vering worn by Saudi women is a modest yet fashionable garment that covers all of a woman's body xcept for her eyes and fingers. The burqa, on the other hand, is an evil tool of patriarchal oppression that covers all of a woman's body except for her eyes<br />and fingers.<br /><br />Q: It sounds like the same thing with a different  name.<br />A: Now, don't go comparing Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia. The Saudis are our friends.<br /><br />Q: But I thought you said 15 of the 19 hijackers on September 11th were from Saudi Arabia.<br />A: Yes, but they trained in Afghanistan.<br /><br />Q: Who trained them?<br />A: A very bad man named Osama bin Laden.<br /><br />Q: Was he from Afghanist! an?<br />A: Uh, no, he was from Saudi Arabia too. But he was a bad man, a very bad man.<br /><br />Q: I seem to recall he was our friend once.<br />A: Only when we helped him and the mujahadeen repel the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan back in the 1980s.<br /><br />Q: Who are the Soviets? Was that the Evil Communist Empire  Ronald Reagan talked about?<br />A: There are no more Soviets. The Soviet Union broke up in 1990 or there abouts, and now they have elections and capitalism like us. We call them Russians now.<br /><br />Q: So the Soviets, I mean, the Russians, are now our  friends?<br />A: Well, not really. You see, they were our friends for many years after they stopped being Soviets, bu t then they decided not to support our invasion of Iraq, so we're mad at them now. We're also mad at  the French and the Germans because they didn't help us invade Iraqe ither.<br /><br />Q: So the French and Germans are evil, too?<br />A: Not exactly evil, but just bad enough that we had to rename French fries and French toast to Freedom Fries and Freedom Toast.<br /><br />Q: Do we always rename foods whenever another country doesn't do what we want them to do?<br />A: No, we just do that to our friends. Our enemies, we  invade.<br /><br />Q: But wasn't Iraq one of our friends back in the  1980s?<br />A: Well, yeah. For a while.<br /><br />Q: Was Saddam Hussein ruler of Iraq back then?<br />A: Yes, but at the time he was fighting against Iran, which made him our friend, temporarily.<br /><br />Q: Why did that make him our friend?<br />A: Because at that time, Iran was our enemy.<br /><br />Q: Isn't that when he gassed the Kurds?<br />A: Yeah, but since he was fighting against Iran at the time, we looked the other way, to show him we were his friend.<br /><br />Q: So anyone who fights against one of our enemies automatically becomes our friend?<br />A: Most of the time, yes.<br /><br />Q: And anyone who fights against one of our friends is automatically an enemy?<br />A: Sometimes that's true, t! oo. However, if American corporations can profit by selling weapons to both sides at the same time, all  the better.<br /><br />Q: Why?<br />A: Because war is good for the economy, which meanswar is good for America. Also, since God is on America's side, anyone who opposes war is  a godless un-American Communist. Do you understand now why we attacked Iraq?<br /><br />Q: I think so. We attacked them because God wanted us to,r ight?<br />A: Yes.<br /><br />Q: But how did we know God wanted us to attack Iraq?<br />A: Well, you see, God personally speaks to George W. Bush and tells him what to do.<br /><br />Q: So basically, what you're saying is that we attacked Iraq because George W. Bush hears voices in his head?<br />A. Yes! You finally understand how the world works. Now close your eyes, make yourself comfortable, and go to sleep.

The reason there is a gap on a real mirror, is because the silver is on the back of the mirror UNDER the glass. Whereas with a two-way mirror, the silver is on the surface. Keep it in mind!

  <div class="quotecontent">The lizard brain<br /><br />Maybe you remember way back in school when you learned that the human brain still contains a prehistoric lizard brain at its center. This is the key to understanding women and what you can expect from them.<br /><br />Women still have direct contact with the lizard brain, something which men have been able to shut down about a trillion centuries ago.<br /><br />Have you ever noticed how women get cold very easily even if the temperature is only 1 µC below optimum? That's because lizards are cold-blooded, and a woman's lizard brain is telling her that she better get to a warm place quickly or her muscles will freeze up and her heart will stop beating.<br /><br />Have you noticed how a woman always seems to be thinking about two things at once? That's because a lizard's eyes point in two different directions, so it always has to process two completely different scenes.<br /><br />Have you noticed how two women can hate each other and have a serious fight, even if they don't know each other and they are sitting on opposite sides of the room? Lizards are very territorial and fight with each other by standing in one place and making threatening movements.<br /><br />Have you ever noticed how a woman drives? It's that two-direction eye problem again. That's why she thinks that it's possible to drive at high speed on a roundabout while looking in the mirror and adjusting her make-up.<br /><br />Have you noticed how a woman can sit somewhere completely happy, then suddenly out of nowhere she begins to cut you to pieces with her tongue? Well, just watch a lizard catch flies and you will know where that comes from.<br /><br />Women can lay in the sun on a big rock all day and never get bored.<br /><br />If a woman gets the chance, and she thinks that she can get away with it, she will color her hair orange and green and get it styled into a spiky hairdo. This is definitely a lizard haircut.<br /><br />I'm sure that there are hundreds of examples. The point is, the lizard brain theory explains everything. I am expecting to win the Nobel Prize this year.</div>

<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Hey,<br />This is a conversation between a father and a son...you will probably understand the reason why US attacked Iraq and how the world functions better after reading<br />this.<br /><br />Q: Daddy, why did we have to attack Iraq?<br />A: Because they had weapons of mass destruction,  honey.<br /><br />Q: But the inspectors didn't find any weapons of mass destruction.<br />A: That's because the Iraqis were hiding them.<br /><br />Q: And that's why we invaded Iraq?<br />A: Yep. Invasions always work better than  inspections.<br /><br />Q: But after we invaded them, we STILL didn't find any weapons  of mass destruction, did we?<br />A: That's because the weapons are so well hidden. Don't worry, we'll find something, probably right before the 2004 election.<br /><br />Q: Why did Iraq want all those weapons of mass  destruction?<br />A: To use them in a war, silly.<br /><br />Q: I'm confused. If they had all those weapons that they planned to use in a war, then why didn't they use any of those weapons when we  went to war with them?<br />A: Well, obviously they didn't want anyone to know they had  those weapons,so they chose to die by the thousands rather than defend themselves.<br /><br />Q: That doesn't make sense Daddy. Why would they choose to die  if they had all those big weapons to fight us back with?<br />A: It's a different culture. It's not supposed to make  sense.<br /><br />Q: I don't know about you, but I don't think they had any of those weapons our government said they did.<br />A: Well, you know, it doesn't matter whether or not they had those weapons. We had another good reason to invade them anyway.<br /><br />Q: And what was that?<br />A: Even if Iraq didn't have weapons of mass destruction, Saddam Hussein was a cruel dictator, which is another good reason to invade another country.<br /><br />Q: Why? What does a cruel dictator do that makes it OK to invade his country?<br />A: Well, for one thing, he tortured his own people.<br /><br />Q: Kind of like what they do in China?<br />A: Don't go comparing China to Iraq. China is a good economic competitor, where millions of people work for slave wages in sweatshops to make U.S. corporations richer.<br /><br />Q: So if a country lets its people be exploited for American corporate<br />gain, it's a good country, even if that country tortures people?<br />A: Right.<br /><br />Q: Why were people in Iraq being tortured?<br />A: For political crimes, mostly, like criticizing the  government. People who criticized the government in Iraq were sent to prison and tortured.<br /><br />Q: Isn't that exactly what happens in China?<br />A: I told you, China is different.<br /><br />Q: What's the difference between China and Iraq?<br />A: Well, for one thing, Iraq was ruled by the Ba'ath party, while China is Communist.<br /><br />Q: Didn't you once tell me Communists were bad?<br />A: No, just Cuban Communists are bad.<br /><br />Q: How are the Cuban Communists bad?<br />A: Well, for one thing, people who criticize the government in Cuba are sent to prison and tortured.<br /><br />Q: Like in Iraq?<br />A: Exactly.<br /><br />Q: And like in China, too?<br />A: I told you, China's a good economic competitor. Cuba, on the other hand, is not.<br /><br />Q: How come Cuba isn't a good economic competitor?<br />A: Well, you see, back in the early 1960s, our government passed some laws that made it illegal for Americans to trade or do any business with Cuba until they stopped being Communists and started being capitalists like us.<br /><br />Q: But if we got rid of those laws, opened up trade with Cuba,and started doing business with them, wouldn't that help the Cubans become capitalists?<br />A: Don't be a smart-ass.<br /><br />Q: I didn't think I was being one.<br />A: Well, anyway, they also don't have freedom of religion in Cuba.<br /><br />Q: Kind of like China and the @!#$ movement?<br />A: I told you, stop saying bad things about China. Anyway,  Saddam Hussein came to power through a military coup, so he's not really a legitimate leader anyway.<br /><br />Q: What's a military coup?<br />A: That's when a military general takes over the government of a country by force, instead of holding free elections like we do in the United States.<br /><br />Q: Didn't the ruler of Pakistan come to power by a military coup?<br />A: You mean General Pervez Musharraf? Uh, yeah, he did, but Pakistan is our friend.<br /><br />Q: Why is Pakistan our friend if their leader is illegitimate?<br />A: I never said Pervez Musharraf was illegitimate.<br /><br />Q: Didn't you just say a military general who comes to power by forcibly overthrowing the legitimate government of a nation is an illegitimate leader?<br />A: Only Saddam Hussein. Pervez Musharraf is our friend, because he helped us invade Afghanistan.<br /><br />Q: Why did we invade Afghanistan?<br />A: Because of what they did to us on September 11th.<br /><br />Q: What did Afghanistan do to us on September 11th?<br />A: Well, on September 11th, nineteen men, fifteen of them Saudi Arabians, hijacked four airplanes and flew three of them into buildings,killing over 3,000 Americans.<br /><br />Q: So how did Afghanistan figure into all that?<br />A: Afghanistan was where those bad men trained, under the oppressive rule of the Taliban.<br /><br />Q: Aren't the Taliban those bad radical Islamics who chopped off people's heads and hands?<br />A: Yes, that's exactly who they were. Not only did they chop off people's heads and hands, but they oppressed women, too.<br /><br />Q: Didn't the Bush administration giv e the Taliban 43 million dollars back in May of 2001?<br />A: Yes, but that money was a reward because they did such a good job fighting drugs.<br /><br />Q: Fighting drugs?<br />A: Yes, the Taliban were very helpful in stopping people from growing opium poppies.<br /><br />Q: How did they do such a good job?<br />A: Simple. If people were caught growing opium poppies, the Taliban would have their hands and heads cut off.<br /><br />Q: So, when the Taliban cut off people's heads and hands for growing flowers, that was OK, but not if they cut people's heads and hands off for other reasons?<br />A: Yes. It's OK with us if radical Islamic fundamentalists cut off people's hands for growing flowers, but it's cruel if they cut off people's hands for stealing bread.<br /><br />Q: Don't they also cut off people's hands and heads in Saudi Arabia?<br />A: That's different. Afghanistan was ruled by a tyrannical patriarchy that oppressed women and forced them to wear burqas whenever they  were in public, with death by stoning as the penalty for women who did not comply.<br /><br />Q: Don't Saudi women have to wear burqas in public,  too?<br />A: No, Saudi women merely wear a traditional Islamic body overing.<br /><br />Q: What's the difference?<br />A: The traditional Islamic co! vering worn by Saudi women is a modest yet fashionable garment that covers all of a woman's body xcept for her eyes and fingers. The burqa, on the other hand, is an evil tool of patriarchal oppression that covers all of a woman's body except for her eyes<br />and fingers.<br /><br />Q: It sounds like the same thing with a different  name.<br />A: Now, don't go comparing Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia. The Saudis are our friends.<br /><br />Q: But I thought you said 15 of the 19 hijackers on September 11th were from Saudi Arabia.<br />A: Yes, but they trained in Afghanistan.<br /><br />Q: Who trained them?<br />A: A very bad man named Osama bin Laden.<br /><br />Q: Was he from Afghanist! an?<br />A: Uh, no, he was from Saudi Arabia too. But he was a bad man, a very bad man.<br /><br />Q: I seem to recall he was our friend once.<br />A: Only when we helped him and the mujahadeen repel the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan back in the 1980s.<br /><br />Q: Who are the Soviets? Was that the Evil Communist Empire  Ronald Reagan talked about?<br />A: There are no more Soviets. The Soviet Union broke up in 1990 or there abouts, and now they have elections and capitalism like us. We call them Russians now.<br /><br />Q: So the Soviets, I mean, the Russians, are now our  friends?<br />A: Well, not really. You see, they were our friends for many years after they stopped being Soviets, bu t then they decided not to support our invasion of Iraq, so we're mad at them now. We're also mad at  the French and the Germans because they didn't help us invade Iraqe ither.<br /><br />Q: So the French and Germans are evil, too?<br />A: Not exactly evil, but just bad enough that we had to rename French fries and French toast to Freedom Fries and Freedom Toast.<br /><br />Q: Do we always rename foods whenever another country doesn't do what we want them to do?<br />A: No, we just do that to our friends. Our enemies, we  invade.<br /><br />Q: But wasn't Iraq one of our friends back in the  1980s?<br />A: Well, yeah. For a while.<br /><br />Q: Was Saddam Hussein ruler of Iraq back then?<br />A: Yes, but at the time he was fighting against Iran, which made him our friend, temporarily.<br /><br />Q: Why did that make him our friend?<br />A: Because at that time, Iran was our enemy.<br /><br />Q: Isn't that when he gassed the Kurds?<br />A: Yeah, but since he was fighting against Iran at the time, we looked the other way, to show him we were his friend.<br /><br />Q: So anyone who fights against one of our enemies automatically becomes our friend?<br />A: Most of the time, yes.<br /><br />Q: And anyone who fights against one of our friends is automatically an enemy?<br />A: Sometimes that's true, t! oo. However, if American corporations can profit by selling weapons to both sides at the same time, all  the better.<br /><br />Q: Why?<br />A: Because war is good for the economy, which meanswar is good for America. Also, since God is on America's side, anyone who opposes war is  a godless un-American Communist. Do you understand now why we attacked Iraq?<br /><br />Q: I think so. We attacked them because God wanted us to,r ight?<br />A: Yes.<br /><br />Q: But how did we know God wanted us to attack Iraq?<br />A: Well, you see, God personally speaks to George W. Bush and tells him what to do.<br /><br />Q: So basically, what you're saying is that we attacked Iraq because George W. Bush hears voices in his head?<br />A. Yes! You finally understand how the world works. Now close your eyes, make yourself comfortable, and go to sleep. Good night.<br /><br />Good night, Daddy.<br /></div></div>]]></body></post><post id="p13617" date="Posted: Sun Sep 28, 2003 6:00 am "><author>[sic]</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">That's great _shank.

  <div class="quotecontent">The lizard brain<br /><br />Maybe you remember way back in school when you learned that the human brain still contains a prehistoric lizard brain at its center. This is the key to understanding women and what you can expect from them.<br /><br />Women still have direct contact with the lizard brain, something which men have been able to shut down about a trillion centuries ago.<br /><br />Have you ever noticed how women get cold very easily even if the temperature is only 1 µC below optimum? That's because lizards are cold-blooded, and a woman's lizard brain is telling her that she better get to a warm place quickly or her muscles will freeze up and her heart will stop beating.<br /><br />Have you noticed how a woman always seems to be thinking about two things at once? That's because a lizard's eyes point in two different directions, so it always has to process two completely different scenes.<br /><br />Have you noticed how two women can hate each other and have a serious fight, even if they don't know each other and they are sitting on opposite sides of the room? Lizards are very territorial and fight with each other by standing in one place and making threatening movements.<br /><br />Have you ever noticed how a woman drives? It's that two-direction eye problem again. That's why she thinks that it's possible to drive at high speed on a roundabout while looking in the mirror and adjusting her make-up.<br /><br />Have you noticed how a woman can sit somewhere completely happy, then suddenly out of nowhere she begins to cut you to pieces with her tongue? Well, just watch a lizard catch flies and you will know where that comes from.<br /><br />Women can lay in the sun on a big rock all day and never get bored.<br /><br />If a woman gets the chance, and she thinks that she can get away with it, she will color her hair orange and green and get it styled into a spiky hairdo. This is definitely a lizard haircut.<br /><br />I'm sure that there are hundreds of examples. The point is, the lizard brain theory explains everything. I am expecting to win the Nobel Prize this year.</div>

<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Hey,<br />This is a conversation between a father and a son...you will probably understand the reason why US attacked Iraq and how the world functions better after reading<br />this.<br /><br />Q: Daddy, why did we have to attack Iraq?<br />A: Because they had weapons of mass destruction,  honey.<br /><br />Q: But the inspectors didn't find any weapons of mass destruction.<br />A: That's because the Iraqis were hiding them.<br /><br />Q: And that's why we invaded Iraq?<br />A: Yep. Invasions always work better than  inspections.<br /><br />Q: But after we invaded them, we STILL didn't find any weapons  of mass destruction, did we?<br />A: That's because the weapons are so well hidden. Don't worry, we'll find something, probably right before the 2004 election.<br /><br />Q: Why did Iraq want all those weapons of mass  destruction?<br />A: To use them in a war, silly.<br /><br />Q: I'm confused. If they had all those weapons that they planned to use in a war, then why didn't they use any of those weapons when we  went to war with them?<br />A: Well, obviously they didn't want anyone to know they had  those weapons,so they chose to die by the thousands rather than defend themselves.<br /><br />Q: That doesn't make sense Daddy. Why would they choose to die  if they had all those big weapons to fight us back with?<br />A: It's a different culture. It's not supposed to make  sense.<br /><br />Q: I don't know about you, but I don't think they had any of those weapons our government said they did.<br />A: Well, you know, it doesn't matter whether or not they had those weapons. We had another good reason to invade them anyway.<br /><br />Q: And what was that?<br />A: Even if Iraq didn't have weapons of mass destruction, Saddam Hussein was a cruel dictator, which is another good reason to invade another country.<br /><br />Q: Why? What does a cruel dictator do that makes it OK to invade his country?<br />A: Well, for one thing, he tortured his own people.<br /><br />Q: Kind of like what they do in China?<br />A: Don't go comparing China to Iraq. China is a good economic competitor, where millions of people work for slave wages in sweatshops to make U.S. corporations richer.<br /><br />Q: So if a country lets its people be exploited for American corporate<br />gain, it's a good country, even if that country tortures people?<br />A: Right.<br /><br />Q: Why were people in Iraq being tortured?<br />A: For political crimes, mostly, like criticizing the  government. People who criticized the government in Iraq were sent to prison and tortured.<br /><br />Q: Isn't that exactly what happens in China?<br />A: I told you, China is different.<br /><br />Q: What's the difference between China and Iraq?<br />A: Well, for one thing, Iraq was ruled by the Ba'ath party, while China is Communist.<br /><br />Q: Didn't you once tell me Communists were bad?<br />A: No, just Cuban Communists are bad.<br /><br />Q: How are the Cuban Communists bad?<br />A: Well, for one thing, people who criticize the government in Cuba are sent to prison and tortured.<br /><br />Q: Like in Iraq?<br />A: Exactly.<br /><br />Q: And like in China, too?<br />A: I told you, China's a good economic competitor. Cuba, on the other hand, is not.<br /><br />Q: How come Cuba isn't a good economic competitor?<br />A: Well, you see, back in the early 1960s, our government passed some laws that made it illegal for Americans to trade or do any business with Cuba until they stopped being Communists and started being capitalists like us.<br /><br />Q: But if we got rid of those laws, opened up trade with Cuba,and started doing business with them, wouldn't that help the Cubans become capitalists?<br />A: Don't be a smart-ass.<br /><br />Q: I didn't think I was being one.<br />A: Well, anyway, they also don't have freedom of religion in Cuba.<br /><br />Q: Kind of like China and the @!#$ movement?<br />A: I told you, stop saying bad things about China. Anyway,  Saddam Hussein came to power through a military coup, so he's not really a legitimate leader anyway.<br /><br />Q: What's a military coup?<br />A: That's when a military general takes over the government of a country by force, instead of holding free elections like we do in the United States.<br /><br />Q: Didn't the ruler of Pakistan come to power by a military coup?<br />A: You mean General Pervez Musharraf? Uh, yeah, he did, but Pakistan is our friend.<br /><br />Q: Why is Pakistan our friend if their leader is illegitimate?<br />A: I never said Pervez Musharraf was illegitimate.<br /><br />Q: Didn't you just say a military general who comes to power by forcibly overthrowing the legitimate government of a nation is an illegitimate leader?<br />A: Only Saddam Hussein. Pervez Musharraf is our friend, because he helped us invade Afghanistan.<br /><br />Q: Why did we invade Afghanistan?<br />A: Because of what they did to us on September 11th.<br /><br />Q: What did Afghanistan do to us on September 11th?<br />A: Well, on September 11th, nineteen men, fifteen of them Saudi Arabians, hijacked four airplanes and flew three of them into buildings,killing over 3,000 Americans.<br /><br />Q: So how did Afghanistan figure into all that?<br />A: Afghanistan was where those bad men trained, under the oppressive rule of the Taliban.<br /><br />Q: Aren't the Taliban those bad radical Islamics who chopped off people's heads and hands?<br />A: Yes, that's exactly who they were. Not only did they chop off people's heads and hands, but they oppressed women, too.<br /><br />Q: Didn't the Bush administration giv e the Taliban 43 million dollars back in May of 2001?<br />A: Yes, but that money was a reward because they did such a good job fighting drugs.<br /><br />Q: Fighting drugs?<br />A: Yes, the Taliban were very helpful in stopping people from growing opium poppies.<br /><br />Q: How did they do such a good job?<br />A: Simple. If people were caught growing opium poppies, the Taliban would have their hands and heads cut off.<br /><br />Q: So, when the Taliban cut off people's heads and hands for growing flowers, that was OK, but not if they cut people's heads and hands off for other reasons?<br />A: Yes. It's OK with us if radical Islamic fundamentalists cut off people's hands for growing flowers, but it's cruel if they cut off people's hands for stealing bread.<br /><br />Q: Don't they also cut off people's hands and heads in Saudi Arabia?<br />A: That's different. Afghanistan was ruled by a tyrannical patriarchy that oppressed women and forced them to wear burqas whenever they  were in public, with death by stoning as the penalty for women who did not comply.<br /><br />Q: Don't Saudi women have to wear burqas in public,  too?<br />A: No, Saudi women merely wear a traditional Islamic body overing.<br /><br />Q: What's the difference?<br />A: The traditional Islamic co! vering worn by Saudi women is a modest yet fashionable garment that covers all of a woman's body xcept for her eyes and fingers. The burqa, on the other hand, is an evil tool of patriarchal oppression that covers all of a woman's body except for her eyes<br />and fingers.<br /><br />Q: It sounds like the same thing with a different  name.<br />A: Now, don't go comparing Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia. The Saudis are our friends.<br /><br />Q: But I thought you said 15 of the 19 hijackers on September 11th were from Saudi Arabia.<br />A: Yes, but they trained in Afghanistan.<br /><br />Q: Who trained them?<br />A: A very bad man named Osama bin Laden.<br /><br />Q: Was he from Afghanist! an?<br />A: Uh, no, he was from Saudi Arabia too. But he was a bad man, a very bad man.<br /><br />Q: I seem to recall he was our friend once.<br />A: Only when we helped him and the mujahadeen repel the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan back in the 1980s.<br /><br />Q: Who are the Soviets? Was that the Evil Communist Empire  Ronald Reagan talked about?<br />A: There are no more Soviets. The Soviet Union broke up in 1990 or there abouts, and now they have elections and capitalism like us. We call them Russians now.<br /><br />Q: So the Soviets, I mean, the Russians, are now our  friends?<br />A: Well, not really. You see, they were our friends for many years after they stopped being Soviets, bu t then they decided not to support our invasion of Iraq, so we're mad at them now. We're also mad at  the French and the Germans because they didn't help us invade Iraqe ither.<br /><br />Q: So the French and Germans are evil, too?<br />A: Not exactly evil, but just bad enough that we had to rename French fries and French toast to Freedom Fries and Freedom Toast.<br /><br />Q: Do we always rename foods whenever another country doesn't do what we want them to do?<br />A: No, we just do that to our friends. Our enemies, we  invade.<br /><br />Q: But wasn't Iraq one of our friends back in the  1980s?<br />A: Well, yeah. For a while.<br /><br />Q: Was Saddam Hussein ruler of Iraq back then?<br />A: Yes, but at the time he was fighting against Iran, which made him our friend, temporarily.<br /><br />Q: Why did that make him our friend?<br />A: Because at that time, Iran was our enemy.<br /><br />Q: Isn't that when he gassed the Kurds?<br />A: Yeah, but since he was fighting against Iran at the time, we looked the other way, to show him we were his friend.<br /><br />Q: So anyone who fights against one of our enemies automatically becomes our friend?<br />A: Most of the time, yes.<br /><br />Q: And anyone who fights against one of our friends is automatically an enemy?<br />A: Sometimes that's true, t! oo. However, if American corporations can profit by selling weapons to both sides at the same time, all  the better.<br /><br />Q: Why?<br />A: Because war is good for the economy, which meanswar is good for America. Also, since God is on America's side, anyone who opposes war is  a godless un-American Communist. Do you understand now why we attacked Iraq?<br /><br />Q: I think so. We attacked them because God wanted us to,r ight?<br />A: Yes.<br /><br />Q: But how did we know God wanted us to attack Iraq?<br />A: Well, you see, God personally speaks to George W. Bush and tells him what to do.<br /><br />Q: So basically, what you're saying is that we attacked Iraq because George W. Bush hears voices in his head?<br />A. Yes! You finally understand how the world works. Now close your eyes, make yourself comfortable, and go to sleep. Good night.<br /><br />Good night, Daddy.<br /></div></div>]]></body></post><post id="p13617" date="Posted: Sun Sep 28, 2003 6:00 am "><author>[sic]</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">That's great _shank.

It is Very difficult to positively identify the surface by just looking at it. So, how do we determine with any amount of certainty what type of mirror we are looking at? 
<br /><br />CONDUCT THIS SIMPLE TEST: Place the tip of your fingernail against the reflective surface and if there is a GAP between your fingernail and the image of the nail, then it is a GENUINE mirror. However, if your fingernail DIRECTLY TOUCHES the image of your nail, then BEWARE, IT IS A 2-WAY MIRROR! (there is someone seeing you from the other side).  The reason there is a gap on a real mirror, is because the silver is on the back of the mirror UNDER the glass. Whereas with a two-way mirror, the silver is on the surface. Keep it in mind! Make sure and check every time you enter in hotel rooms. May be someone is making a film on you.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p15645" date="Posted: Fri Nov 21, 2003 8:01 am "><author>Rayne</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">So basically, what you're saying is that we attacked Iraq because George W.

  <div class="quotecontent">The lizard brain<br /><br />Maybe you remember way back in school when you learned that the human brain still contains a prehistoric lizard brain at its center. This is the key to understanding women and what you can expect from them.<br /><br />Women still have direct contact with the lizard brain, something which men have been able to shut down about a trillion centuries ago.<br /><br />Have you ever noticed how women get cold very easily even if the temperature is only 1 µC below optimum? That's because lizards are cold-blooded, and a woman's lizard brain is telling her that she better get to a warm place quickly or her muscles will freeze up and her heart will stop beating.<br /><br />Have you noticed how a woman always seems to be thinking about two things at once? That's because a lizard's eyes point in two different directions, so it always has to process two completely different scenes.<br /><br />Have you noticed how two women can hate each other and have a serious fight, even if they don't know each other and they are sitting on opposite sides of the room? Lizards are very territorial and fight with each other by standing in one place and making threatening movements.<br /><br />Have you ever noticed how a woman drives? It's that two-direction eye problem again. That's why she thinks that it's possible to drive at high speed on a roundabout while looking in the mirror and adjusting her make-up.<br /><br />Have you noticed how a woman can sit somewhere completely happy, then suddenly out of nowhere she begins to cut you to pieces with her tongue? Well, just watch a lizard catch flies and you will know where that comes from.<br /><br />Women can lay in the sun on a big rock all day and never get bored.<br /><br />If a woman gets the chance, and she thinks that she can get away with it, she will color her hair orange and green and get it styled into a spiky hairdo. This is definitely a lizard haircut.<br /><br />I'm sure that there are hundreds of examples. The point is, the lizard brain theory explains everything. I am expecting to win the Nobel Prize this year.</div>

<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Hey,<br />This is a conversation between a father and a son...you will probably understand the reason why US attacked Iraq and how the world functions better after reading<br />this.<br /><br />Q: Daddy, why did we have to attack Iraq?<br />A: Because they had weapons of mass destruction,  honey.<br /><br />Q: But the inspectors didn't find any weapons of mass destruction.<br />A: That's because the Iraqis were hiding them.<br /><br />Q: And that's why we invaded Iraq?<br />A: Yep. Invasions always work better than  inspections.<br /><br />Q: But after we invaded them, we STILL didn't find any weapons  of mass destruction, did we?<br />A: That's because the weapons are so well hidden. Don't worry, we'll find something, probably right before the 2004 election.<br /><br />Q: Why did Iraq want all those weapons of mass  destruction?<br />A: To use them in a war, silly.<br /><br />Q: I'm confused. If they had all those weapons that they planned to use in a war, then why didn't they use any of those weapons when we  went to war with them?<br />A: Well, obviously they didn't want anyone to know they had  those weapons,so they chose to die by the thousands rather than defend themselves.<br /><br />Q: That doesn't make sense Daddy. Why would they choose to die  if they had all those big weapons to fight us back with?<br />A: It's a different culture. It's not supposed to make  sense.<br /><br />Q: I don't know about you, but I don't think they had any of those weapons our government said they did.<br />A: Well, you know, it doesn't matter whether or not they had those weapons. We had another good reason to invade them anyway.<br /><br />Q: And what was that?<br />A: Even if Iraq didn't have weapons of mass destruction, Saddam Hussein was a cruel dictator, which is another good reason to invade another country.<br /><br />Q: Why? What does a cruel dictator do that makes it OK to invade his country?<br />A: Well, for one thing, he tortured his own people.<br /><br />Q: Kind of like what they do in China?<br />A: Don't go comparing China to Iraq. China is a good economic competitor, where millions of people work for slave wages in sweatshops to make U.S. corporations richer.<br /><br />Q: So if a country lets its people be exploited for American corporate<br />gain, it's a good country, even if that country tortures people?<br />A: Right.<br /><br />Q: Why were people in Iraq being tortured?<br />A: For political crimes, mostly, like criticizing the  government. People who criticized the government in Iraq were sent to prison and tortured.<br /><br />Q: Isn't that exactly what happens in China?<br />A: I told you, China is different.<br /><br />Q: What's the difference between China and Iraq?<br />A: Well, for one thing, Iraq was ruled by the Ba'ath party, while China is Communist.<br /><br />Q: Didn't you once tell me Communists were bad?<br />A: No, just Cuban Communists are bad.<br /><br />Q: How are the Cuban Communists bad?<br />A: Well, for one thing, people who criticize the government in Cuba are sent to prison and tortured.<br /><br />Q: Like in Iraq?<br />A: Exactly.<br /><br />Q: And like in China, too?<br />A: I told you, China's a good economic competitor. Cuba, on the other hand, is not.<br /><br />Q: How come Cuba isn't a good economic competitor?<br />A: Well, you see, back in the early 1960s, our government passed some laws that made it illegal for Americans to trade or do any business with Cuba until they stopped being Communists and started being capitalists like us.<br /><br />Q: But if we got rid of those laws, opened up trade with Cuba,and started doing business with them, wouldn't that help the Cubans become capitalists?<br />A: Don't be a smart-ass.<br /><br />Q: I didn't think I was being one.<br />A: Well, anyway, they also don't have freedom of religion in Cuba.<br /><br />Q: Kind of like China and the @!#$ movement?<br />A: I told you, stop saying bad things about China. Anyway,  Saddam Hussein came to power through a military coup, so he's not really a legitimate leader anyway.<br /><br />Q: What's a military coup?<br />A: That's when a military general takes over the government of a country by force, instead of holding free elections like we do in the United States.<br /><br />Q: Didn't the ruler of Pakistan come to power by a military coup?<br />A: You mean General Pervez Musharraf? Uh, yeah, he did, but Pakistan is our friend.<br /><br />Q: Why is Pakistan our friend if their leader is illegitimate?<br />A: I never said Pervez Musharraf was illegitimate.<br /><br />Q: Didn't you just say a military general who comes to power by forcibly overthrowing the legitimate government of a nation is an illegitimate leader?<br />A: Only Saddam Hussein. Pervez Musharraf is our friend, because he helped us invade Afghanistan.<br /><br />Q: Why did we invade Afghanistan?<br />A: Because of what they did to us on September 11th.<br /><br />Q: What did Afghanistan do to us on September 11th?<br />A: Well, on September 11th, nineteen men, fifteen of them Saudi Arabians, hijacked four airplanes and flew three of them into buildings,killing over 3,000 Americans.<br /><br />Q: So how did Afghanistan figure into all that?<br />A: Afghanistan was where those bad men trained, under the oppressive rule of the Taliban.<br /><br />Q: Aren't the Taliban those bad radical Islamics who chopped off people's heads and hands?<br />A: Yes, that's exactly who they were. Not only did they chop off people's heads and hands, but they oppressed women, too.<br /><br />Q: Didn't the Bush administration giv e the Taliban 43 million dollars back in May of 2001?<br />A: Yes, but that money was a reward because they did such a good job fighting drugs.<br /><br />Q: Fighting drugs?<br />A: Yes, the Taliban were very helpful in stopping people from growing opium poppies.<br /><br />Q: How did they do such a good job?<br />A: Simple. If people were caught growing opium poppies, the Taliban would have their hands and heads cut off.<br /><br />Q: So, when the Taliban cut off people's heads and hands for growing flowers, that was OK, but not if they cut people's heads and hands off for other reasons?<br />A: Yes. It's OK with us if radical Islamic fundamentalists cut off people's hands for growing flowers, but it's cruel if they cut off people's hands for stealing bread.<br /><br />Q: Don't they also cut off people's hands and heads in Saudi Arabia?<br />A: That's different. Afghanistan was ruled by a tyrannical patriarchy that oppressed women and forced them to wear burqas whenever they  were in public, with death by stoning as the penalty for women who did not comply.<br /><br />Q: Don't Saudi women have to wear burqas in public,  too?<br />A: No, Saudi women merely wear a traditional Islamic body overing.<br /><br />Q: What's the difference?<br />A: The traditional Islamic co! vering worn by Saudi women is a modest yet fashionable garment that covers all of a woman's body xcept for her eyes and fingers. The burqa, on the other hand, is an evil tool of patriarchal oppression that covers all of a woman's body except for her eyes<br />and fingers.<br /><br />Q: It sounds like the same thing with a different  name.<br />A: Now, don't go comparing Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia. The Saudis are our friends.<br /><br />Q: But I thought you said 15 of the 19 hijackers on September 11th were from Saudi Arabia.<br />A: Yes, but they trained in Afghanistan.<br /><br />Q: Who trained them?<br />A: A very bad man named Osama bin Laden.<br /><br />Q: Was he from Afghanist! an?<br />A: Uh, no, he was from Saudi Arabia too. But he was a bad man, a very bad man.<br /><br />Q: I seem to recall he was our friend once.<br />A: Only when we helped him and the mujahadeen repel the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan back in the 1980s.<br /><br />Q: Who are the Soviets? Was that the Evil Communist Empire  Ronald Reagan talked about?<br />A: There are no more Soviets. The Soviet Union broke up in 1990 or there abouts, and now they have elections and capitalism like us. We call them Russians now.<br /><br />Q: So the Soviets, I mean, the Russians, are now our  friends?<br />A: Well, not really. You see, they were our friends for many years after they stopped being Soviets, bu t then they decided not to support our invasion of Iraq, so we're mad at them now. We're also mad at  the French and the Germans because they didn't help us invade Iraqe ither.<br /><br />Q: So the French and Germans are evil, too?<br />A: Not exactly evil, but just bad enough that we had to rename French fries and French toast to Freedom Fries and Freedom Toast.<br /><br />Q: Do we always rename foods whenever another country doesn't do what we want them to do?<br />A: No, we just do that to our friends. Our enemies, we  invade.<br /><br />Q: But wasn't Iraq one of our friends back in the  1980s?<br />A: Well, yeah. For a while.<br /><br />Q: Was Saddam Hussein ruler of Iraq back then?<br />A: Yes, but at the time he was fighting against Iran, which made him our friend, temporarily.<br /><br />Q: Why did that make him our friend?<br />A: Because at that time, Iran was our enemy.<br /><br />Q: Isn't that when he gassed the Kurds?<br />A: Yeah, but since he was fighting against Iran at the time, we looked the other way, to show him we were his friend.<br /><br />Q: So anyone who fights against one of our enemies automatically becomes our friend?<br />A: Most of the time, yes.<br /><br />Q: And anyone who fights against one of our friends is automatically an enemy?<br />A: Sometimes that's true, t! oo. However, if American corporations can profit by selling weapons to both sides at the same time, all  the better.<br /><br />Q: Why?<br />A: Because war is good for the economy, which meanswar is good for America. Also, since God is on America's side, anyone who opposes war is  a godless un-American Communist. Do you understand now why we attacked Iraq?<br /><br />Q: I think so. We attacked them because God wanted us to,r ight?<br />A: Yes.<br /><br />Q: But how did we know God wanted us to attack Iraq?<br />A: Well, you see, God personally speaks to George W. Bush and tells him what to do.<br /><br />Q: So basically, what you're saying is that we attacked Iraq because George W. Bush hears voices in his head?<br />A. Yes! You finally understand how the world works. Now close your eyes, make yourself comfortable, and go to sleep. Good night.<br /><br />Good night, Daddy.<br /></div></div>]]></body></post><post id="p13617" date="Posted: Sun Sep 28, 2003 6:00 am "><author>[sic]</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">That's great _shank.

It is Very difficult to positively identify the surface by just looking at it. So, how do we determine with any amount of certainty what type of mirror we are looking at? 
<br /><br />CONDUCT THIS SIMPLE TEST: Place the tip of your fingernail against the reflective surface and if there is a GAP between your fingernail and the image of the nail, then it is a GENUINE mirror. However, if your fingernail DIRECTLY TOUCHES the image of your nail, then BEWARE, IT IS A 2-WAY MIRROR! (there is someone seeing you from the other side).  The reason there is a gap on a real mirror, is because the silver is on the back of the mirror UNDER the glass. Whereas with a two-way mirror, the silver is on the surface. Keep it in mind! Make sure and check every time you enter in hotel rooms. May be someone is making a film on you.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p15645" date="Posted: Fri Nov 21, 2003 8:01 am "><author>Rayne</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">So basically, what you're saying is that we attacked Iraq because George W.

  <div class="quotecontent">The lizard brain<br /><br />Maybe you remember way back in school when you learned that the human brain still contains a prehistoric lizard brain at its center. This is the key to understanding women and what you can expect from them.<br /><br />Women still have direct contact with the lizard brain, something which men have been able to shut down about a trillion centuries ago.<br /><br />Have you ever noticed how women get cold very easily even if the temperature is only 1 µC below optimum? That's because lizards are cold-blooded, and a woman's lizard brain is telling her that she better get to a warm place quickly or her muscles will freeze up and her heart will stop beating.<br /><br />Have you noticed how a woman always seems to be thinking about two things at once? That's because a lizard's eyes point in two different directions, so it always has to process two completely different scenes.<br /><br />Have you noticed how two women can hate each other and have a serious fight, even if they don't know each other and they are sitting on opposite sides of the room? Lizards are very territorial and fight with each other by standing in one place and making threatening movements.<br /><br />Have you ever noticed how a woman drives? It's that two-direction eye problem again. That's why she thinks that it's possible to drive at high speed on a roundabout while looking in the mirror and adjusting her make-up.<br /><br />Have you noticed how a woman can sit somewhere completely happy, then suddenly out of nowhere she begins to cut you to pieces with her tongue? Well, just watch a lizard catch flies and you will know where that comes from.<br /><br />Women can lay in the sun on a big rock all day and never get bored.<br /><br />If a woman gets the chance, and she thinks that she can get away with it, she will color her hair orange and green and get it styled into a spiky hairdo. This is definitely a lizard haircut.<br /><br />I'm sure that there are hundreds of examples. The point is, the lizard brain theory explains everything. I am expecting to win the Nobel Prize this year.</div>

<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Hey,<br />This is a conversation between a father and a son...you will probably understand the reason why US attacked Iraq and how the world functions better after reading<br />this.<br /><br />Q: Daddy, why did we have to attack Iraq?<br />A: Because they had weapons of mass destruction,  honey.<br /><br />Q: But the inspectors didn't find any weapons of mass destruction.<br />A: That's because the Iraqis were hiding them.<br /><br />Q: And that's why we invaded Iraq?<br />A: Yep. Invasions always work better than  inspections.<br /><br />Q: But after we invaded them, we STILL didn't find any weapons  of mass destruction, did we?<br />A: That's because the weapons are so well hidden. Don't worry, we'll find something, probably right before the 2004 election.<br /><br />Q: Why did Iraq want all those weapons of mass  destruction?<br />A: To use them in a war, silly.<br /><br />Q: I'm confused. If they had all those weapons that they planned to use in a war, then why didn't they use any of those weapons when we  went to war with them?<br />A: Well, obviously they didn't want anyone to know they had  those weapons,so they chose to die by the thousands rather than defend themselves.<br /><br />Q: That doesn't make sense Daddy. Why would they choose to die  if they had all those big weapons to fight us back with?<br />A: It's a different culture. It's not supposed to make  sense.<br /><br />Q: I don't know about you, but I don't think they had any of those weapons our government said they did.<br />A: Well, you know, it doesn't matter whether or not they had those weapons. We had another good reason to invade them anyway.<br /><br />Q: And what was that?<br />A: Even if Iraq didn't have weapons of mass destruction, Saddam Hussein was a cruel dictator, which is another good reason to invade another country.<br /><br />Q: Why? What does a cruel dictator do that makes it OK to invade his country?<br />A: Well, for one thing, he tortured his own people.<br /><br />Q: Kind of like what they do in China?<br />A: Don't go comparing China to Iraq. China is a good economic competitor, where millions of people work for slave wages in sweatshops to make U.S. corporations richer.<br /><br />Q: So if a country lets its people be exploited for American corporate<br />gain, it's a good country, even if that country tortures people?<br />A: Right.<br /><br />Q: Why were people in Iraq being tortured?<br />A: For political crimes, mostly, like criticizing the  government. People who criticized the government in Iraq were sent to prison and tortured.<br /><br />Q: Isn't that exactly what happens in China?<br />A: I told you, China is different.<br /><br />Q: What's the difference between China and Iraq?<br />A: Well, for one thing, Iraq was ruled by the Ba'ath party, while China is Communist.<br /><br />Q: Didn't you once tell me Communists were bad?<br />A: No, just Cuban Communists are bad.<br /><br />Q: How are the Cuban Communists bad?<br />A: Well, for one thing, people who criticize the government in Cuba are sent to prison and tortured.<br /><br />Q: Like in Iraq?<br />A: Exactly.<br /><br />Q: And like in China, too?<br />A: I told you, China's a good economic competitor. Cuba, on the other hand, is not.<br /><br />Q: How come Cuba isn't a good economic competitor?<br />A: Well, you see, back in the early 1960s, our government passed some laws that made it illegal for Americans to trade or do any business with Cuba until they stopped being Communists and started being capitalists like us.<br /><br />Q: But if we got rid of those laws, opened up trade with Cuba,and started doing business with them, wouldn't that help the Cubans become capitalists?<br />A: Don't be a smart-ass.<br /><br />Q: I didn't think I was being one.<br />A: Well, anyway, they also don't have freedom of religion in Cuba.<br /><br />Q: Kind of like China and the @!#$ movement?<br />A: I told you, stop saying bad things about China. Anyway,  Saddam Hussein came to power through a military coup, so he's not really a legitimate leader anyway.<br /><br />Q: What's a military coup?<br />A: That's when a military general takes over the government of a country by force, instead of holding free elections like we do in the United States.<br /><br />Q: Didn't the ruler of Pakistan come to power by a military coup?<br />A: You mean General Pervez Musharraf? Uh, yeah, he did, but Pakistan is our friend.<br /><br />Q: Why is Pakistan our friend if their leader is illegitimate?<br />A: I never said Pervez Musharraf was illegitimate.<br /><br />Q: Didn't you just say a military general who comes to power by forcibly overthrowing the legitimate government of a nation is an illegitimate leader?<br />A: Only Saddam Hussein. Pervez Musharraf is our friend, because he helped us invade Afghanistan.<br /><br />Q: Why did we invade Afghanistan?<br />A: Because of what they did to us on September 11th.<br /><br />Q: What did Afghanistan do to us on September 11th?<br />A: Well, on September 11th, nineteen men, fifteen of them Saudi Arabians, hijacked four airplanes and flew three of them into buildings,killing over 3,000 Americans.<br /><br />Q: So how did Afghanistan figure into all that?<br />A: Afghanistan was where those bad men trained, under the oppressive rule of the Taliban.<br /><br />Q: Aren't the Taliban those bad radical Islamics who chopped off people's heads and hands?<br />A: Yes, that's exactly who they were. Not only did they chop off people's heads and hands, but they oppressed women, too.<br /><br />Q: Didn't the Bush administration giv e the Taliban 43 million dollars back in May of 2001?<br />A: Yes, but that money was a reward because they did such a good job fighting drugs.<br /><br />Q: Fighting drugs?<br />A: Yes, the Taliban were very helpful in stopping people from growing opium poppies.<br /><br />Q: How did they do such a good job?<br />A: Simple. If people were caught growing opium poppies, the Taliban would have their hands and heads cut off.<br /><br />Q: So, when the Taliban cut off people's heads and hands for growing flowers, that was OK, but not if they cut people's heads and hands off for other reasons?<br />A: Yes. It's OK with us if radical Islamic fundamentalists cut off people's hands for growing flowers, but it's cruel if they cut off people's hands for stealing bread.<br /><br />Q: Don't they also cut off people's hands and heads in Saudi Arabia?<br />A: That's different. Afghanistan was ruled by a tyrannical patriarchy that oppressed women and forced them to wear burqas whenever they  were in public, with death by stoning as the penalty for women who did not comply.<br /><br />Q: Don't Saudi women have to wear burqas in public,  too?<br />A: No, Saudi women merely wear a traditional Islamic body overing.<br /><br />Q: What's the difference?<br />A: The traditional Islamic co! vering worn by Saudi women is a modest yet fashionable garment that covers all of a woman's body xcept for her eyes and fingers. The burqa, on the other hand, is an evil tool of patriarchal oppression that covers all of a woman's body except for her eyes<br />and fingers.<br /><br />Q: It sounds like the same thing with a different  name.<br />A: Now, don't go comparing Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia. The Saudis are our friends.<br /><br />Q: But I thought you said 15 of the 19 hijackers on September 11th were from Saudi Arabia.<br />A: Yes, but they trained in Afghanistan.<br /><br />Q: Who trained them?<br />A: A very bad man named Osama bin Laden.<br /><br />Q: Was he from Afghanist! an?<br />A: Uh, no, he was from Saudi Arabia too. But he was a bad man, a very bad man.<br /><br />Q: I seem to recall he was our friend once.<br />A: Only when we helped him and the mujahadeen repel the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan back in the 1980s.<br /><br />Q: Who are the Soviets? Was that the Evil Communist Empire  Ronald Reagan talked about?<br />A: There are no more Soviets. The Soviet Union broke up in 1990 or there abouts, and now they have elections and capitalism like us. We call them Russians now.<br /><br />Q: So the Soviets, I mean, the Russians, are now our  friends?<br />A: Well, not really. You see, they were our friends for many years after they stopped being Soviets, bu t then they decided not to support our invasion of Iraq, so we're mad at them now. We're also mad at  the French and the Germans because they didn't help us invade Iraqe ither.<br /><br />Q: So the French and Germans are evil, too?<br />A: Not exactly evil, but just bad enough that we had to rename French fries and French toast to Freedom Fries and Freedom Toast.<br /><br />Q: Do we always rename foods whenever another country doesn't do what we want them to do?<br />A: No, we just do that to our friends. Our enemies, we  invade.<br /><br />Q: But wasn't Iraq one of our friends back in the  1980s?<br />A: Well, yeah. For a while.<br /><br />Q: Was Saddam Hussein ruler of Iraq back then?<br />A: Yes, but at the time he was fighting against Iran, which made him our friend, temporarily.<br /><br />Q: Why did that make him our friend?<br />A: Because at that time, Iran was our enemy.<br /><br />Q: Isn't that when he gassed the Kurds?<br />A: Yeah, but since he was fighting against Iran at the time, we looked the other way, to show him we were his friend.<br /><br />Q: So anyone who fights against one of our enemies automatically becomes our friend?<br />A: Most of the time, yes.<br /><br />Q: And anyone who fights against one of our friends is automatically an enemy?<br />A: Sometimes that's true, t! oo. However, if American corporations can profit by selling weapons to both sides at the same time, all  the better.<br /><br />Q: Why?<br />A: Because war is good for the economy, which meanswar is good for America. Also, since God is on America's side, anyone who opposes war is  a godless un-American Communist. Do you understand now why we attacked Iraq?<br /><br />Q: I think so. We attacked them because God wanted us to,r ight?<br />A: Yes.<br /><br />Q: But how did we know God wanted us to attack Iraq?<br />A: Well, you see, God personally speaks to George W. Bush and tells him what to do.<br /><br />Q: So basically, what you're saying is that we attacked Iraq because George W. Bush hears voices in his head?<br />A. Yes! You finally understand how the world works. Now close your eyes, make yourself comfortable, and go to sleep. Good night.<br /><br />Good night, Daddy.<br /></div></div>]]></body></post><post id="p13617" date="Posted: Sun Sep 28, 2003 6:00 am "><author>[sic]</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">That's great _shank.

It is Very difficult to positively identify the surface by just looking at it. So, how do we determine with any amount of certainty what type of mirror we are looking at? 
<br /><br />CONDUCT THIS SIMPLE TEST: Place the tip of your fingernail against the reflective surface and if there is a GAP between your fingernail and the image of the nail, then it is a GENUINE mirror. However, if your fingernail DIRECTLY TOUCHES the image of your nail, then BEWARE, IT IS A 2-WAY MIRROR! (there is someone seeing you from the other side).  The reason there is a gap on a real mirror, is because the silver is on the back of the mirror UNDER the glass. Whereas with a two-way mirror, the silver is on the surface. Keep it in mind! Make sure and check every time you enter in hotel rooms. May be someone is making a film on you.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p15645" date="Posted: Fri Nov 21, 2003 8:01 am "><author>Rayne</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">So basically, what you're saying is that we attacked Iraq because George W.

  <div class="quotecontent">The lizard brain<br /><br />Maybe you remember way back in school when you learned that the human brain still contains a prehistoric lizard brain at its center. This is the key to understanding women and what you can expect from them.<br /><br />Women still have direct contact with the lizard brain, something which men have been able to shut down about a trillion centuries ago.<br /><br />Have you ever noticed how women get cold very easily even if the temperature is only 1 µC below optimum? That's because lizards are cold-blooded, and a woman's lizard brain is telling her that she better get to a warm place quickly or her muscles will freeze up and her heart will stop beating.<br /><br />Have you noticed how a woman always seems to be thinking about two things at once? That's because a lizard's eyes point in two different directions, so it always has to process two completely different scenes.<br /><br />Have you noticed how two women can hate each other and have a serious fight, even if they don't know each other and they are sitting on opposite sides of the room? Lizards are very territorial and fight with each other by standing in one place and making threatening movements.<br /><br />Have you ever noticed how a woman drives? It's that two-direction eye problem again. That's why she thinks that it's possible to drive at high speed on a roundabout while looking in the mirror and adjusting her make-up.<br /><br />Have you noticed how a woman can sit somewhere completely happy, then suddenly out of nowhere she begins to cut you to pieces with her tongue? Well, just watch a lizard catch flies and you will know where that comes from.<br /><br />Women can lay in the sun on a big rock all day and never get bored.<br /><br />If a woman gets the chance, and she thinks that she can get away with it, she will color her hair orange and green and get it styled into a spiky hairdo. This is definitely a lizard haircut.<br /><br />I'm sure that there are hundreds of examples. The point is, the lizard brain theory explains everything. I am expecting to win the Nobel Prize this year.</div>

And anal is definitely the fast track to the "in" crowd: Ever since I started taking it anal, I've been way popular at school!<br /><br /><br />JEREMY T., Holyoke, MA<br />I have to admit, when I first suggested anal sex to my girlfriend, she looked at me like I was crazy. I offered to double-wrap, use plenty of AstroGlide, but she was still totally freaked over the idea of it. Then she made a deal with me: If I'd bend over for her strap-on, she'd bend over for me.

<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Hey,<br />This is a conversation between a father and a son...you will probably understand the reason why US attacked Iraq and how the world functions better after reading<br />this.<br /><br />Q: Daddy, why did we have to attack Iraq?<br />A: Because they had weapons of mass destruction,  honey.<br /><br />Q: But the inspectors didn't find any weapons of mass destruction.<br />A: That's because the Iraqis were hiding them.<br /><br />Q: And that's why we invaded Iraq?<br />A: Yep. Invasions always work better than  inspections.<br /><br />Q: But after we invaded them, we STILL didn't find any weapons  of mass destruction, did we?<br />A: That's because the weapons are so well hidden. Don't worry, we'll find something, probably right before the 2004 election.<br /><br />Q: Why did Iraq want all those weapons of mass  destruction?<br />A: To use them in a war, silly.<br /><br />Q: I'm confused. If they had all those weapons that they planned to use in a war, then why didn't they use any of those weapons when we  went to war with them?<br />A: Well, obviously they didn't want anyone to know they had  those weapons,so they chose to die by the thousands rather than defend themselves.<br /><br />Q: That doesn't make sense Daddy. Why would they choose to die  if they had all those big weapons to fight us back with?<br />A: It's a different culture. It's not supposed to make  sense.<br /><br />Q: I don't know about you, but I don't think they had any of those weapons our government said they did.<br />A: Well, you know, it doesn't matter whether or not they had those weapons. We had another good reason to invade them anyway.<br /><br />Q: And what was that?<br />A: Even if Iraq didn't have weapons of mass destruction, Saddam Hussein was a cruel dictator, which is another good reason to invade another country.<br /><br />Q: Why? What does a cruel dictator do that makes it OK to invade his country?<br />A: Well, for one thing, he tortured his own people.<br /><br />Q: Kind of like what they do in China?<br />A: Don't go comparing China to Iraq. China is a good economic competitor, where millions of people work for slave wages in sweatshops to make U.S. corporations richer.<br /><br />Q: So if a country lets its people be exploited for American corporate<br />gain, it's a good country, even if that country tortures people?<br />A: Right.<br /><br />Q: Why were people in Iraq being tortured?<br />A: For political crimes, mostly, like criticizing the  government. People who criticized the government in Iraq were sent to prison and tortured.<br /><br />Q: Isn't that exactly what happens in China?<br />A: I told you, China is different.<br /><br />Q: What's the difference between China and Iraq?<br />A: Well, for one thing, Iraq was ruled by the Ba'ath party, while China is Communist.<br /><br />Q: Didn't you once tell me Communists were bad?<br />A: No, just Cuban Communists are bad.<br /><br />Q: How are the Cuban Communists bad?<br />A: Well, for one thing, people who criticize the government in Cuba are sent to prison and tortured.<br /><br />Q: Like in Iraq?<br />A: Exactly.<br /><br />Q: And like in China, too?<br />A: I told you, China's a good economic competitor. Cuba, on the other hand, is not.<br /><br />Q: How come Cuba isn't a good economic competitor?<br />A: Well, you see, back in the early 1960s, our government passed some laws that made it illegal for Americans to trade or do any business with Cuba until they stopped being Communists and started being capitalists like us.<br /><br />Q: But if we got rid of those laws, opened up trade with Cuba,and started doing business with them, wouldn't that help the Cubans become capitalists?<br />A: Don't be a smart-ass.<br /><br />Q: I didn't think I was being one.<br />A: Well, anyway, they also don't have freedom of religion in Cuba.<br /><br />Q: Kind of like China and the @!#$ movement?<br />A: I told you, stop saying bad things about China. Anyway,  Saddam Hussein came to power through a military coup, so he's not really a legitimate leader anyway.<br /><br />Q: What's a military coup?<br />A: That's when a military general takes over the government of a country by force, instead of holding free elections like we do in the United States.<br /><br />Q: Didn't the ruler of Pakistan come to power by a military coup?<br />A: You mean General Pervez Musharraf? Uh, yeah, he did, but Pakistan is our friend.<br /><br />Q: Why is Pakistan our friend if their leader is illegitimate?<br />A: I never said Pervez Musharraf was illegitimate.<br /><br />Q: Didn't you just say a military general who comes to power by forcibly overthrowing the legitimate government of a nation is an illegitimate leader?<br />A: Only Saddam Hussein. Pervez Musharraf is our friend, because he helped us invade Afghanistan.<br /><br />Q: Why did we invade Afghanistan?<br />A: Because of what they did to us on September 11th.<br /><br />Q: What did Afghanistan do to us on September 11th?<br />A: Well, on September 11th, nineteen men, fifteen of them Saudi Arabians, hijacked four airplanes and flew three of them into buildings,killing over 3,000 Americans.<br /><br />Q: So how did Afghanistan figure into all that?<br />A: Afghanistan was where those bad men trained, under the oppressive rule of the Taliban.<br /><br />Q: Aren't the Taliban those bad radical Islamics who chopped off people's heads and hands?<br />A: Yes, that's exactly who they were. Not only did they chop off people's heads and hands, but they oppressed women, too.<br /><br />Q: Didn't the Bush administration giv e the Taliban 43 million dollars back in May of 2001?<br />A: Yes, but that money was a reward because they did such a good job fighting drugs.<br /><br />Q: Fighting drugs?<br />A: Yes, the Taliban were very helpful in stopping people from growing opium poppies.<br /><br />Q: How did they do such a good job?<br />A: Simple. If people were caught growing opium poppies, the Taliban would have their hands and heads cut off.<br /><br />Q: So, when the Taliban cut off people's heads and hands for growing flowers, that was OK, but not if they cut people's heads and hands off for other reasons?<br />A: Yes. It's OK with us if radical Islamic fundamentalists cut off people's hands for growing flowers, but it's cruel if they cut off people's hands for stealing bread.<br /><br />Q: Don't they also cut off people's hands and heads in Saudi Arabia?<br />A: That's different. Afghanistan was ruled by a tyrannical patriarchy that oppressed women and forced them to wear burqas whenever they  were in public, with death by stoning as the penalty for women who did not comply.<br /><br />Q: Don't Saudi women have to wear burqas in public,  too?<br />A: No, Saudi women merely wear a traditional Islamic body overing.<br /><br />Q: What's the difference?<br />A: The traditional Islamic co! vering worn by Saudi women is a modest yet fashionable garment that covers all of a woman's body xcept for her eyes and fingers. The burqa, on the other hand, is an evil tool of patriarchal oppression that covers all of a woman's body except for her eyes<br />and fingers.<br /><br />Q: It sounds like the same thing with a different  name.<br />A: Now, don't go comparing Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia. The Saudis are our friends.<br /><br />Q: But I thought you said 15 of the 19 hijackers on September 11th were from Saudi Arabia.<br />A: Yes, but they trained in Afghanistan.<br /><br />Q: Who trained them?<br />A: A very bad man named Osama bin Laden.<br /><br />Q: Was he from Afghanist! an?<br />A: Uh, no, he was from Saudi Arabia too. But he was a bad man, a very bad man.<br /><br />Q: I seem to recall he was our friend once.<br />A: Only when we helped him and the mujahadeen repel the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan back in the 1980s.<br /><br />Q: Who are the Soviets? Was that the Evil Communist Empire  Ronald Reagan talked about?<br />A: There are no more Soviets. The Soviet Union broke up in 1990 or there abouts, and now they have elections and capitalism like us. We call them Russians now.<br /><br />Q: So the Soviets, I mean, the Russians, are now our  friends?<br />A: Well, not really. You see, they were our friends for many years after they stopped being Soviets, bu t then they decided not to support our invasion of Iraq, so we're mad at them now. We're also mad at  the French and the Germans because they didn't help us invade Iraqe ither.<br /><br />Q: So the French and Germans are evil, too?<br />A: Not exactly evil, but just bad enough that we had to rename French fries and French toast to Freedom Fries and Freedom Toast.<br /><br />Q: Do we always rename foods whenever another country doesn't do what we want them to do?<br />A: No, we just do that to our friends. Our enemies, we  invade.<br /><br />Q: But wasn't Iraq one of our friends back in the  1980s?<br />A: Well, yeah. For a while.<br /><br />Q: Was Saddam Hussein ruler of Iraq back then?<br />A: Yes, but at the time he was fighting against Iran, which made him our friend, temporarily.<br /><br />Q: Why did that make him our friend?<br />A: Because at that time, Iran was our enemy.<br /><br />Q: Isn't that when he gassed the Kurds?<br />A: Yeah, but since he was fighting against Iran at the time, we looked the other way, to show him we were his friend.<br /><br />Q: So anyone who fights against one of our enemies automatically becomes our friend?<br />A: Most of the time, yes.<br /><br />Q: And anyone who fights against one of our friends is automatically an enemy?<br />A: Sometimes that's true, t! oo. However, if American corporations can profit by selling weapons to both sides at the same time, all  the better.<br /><br />Q: Why?<br />A: Because war is good for the economy, which meanswar is good for America. Also, since God is on America's side, anyone who opposes war is  a godless un-American Communist. Do you understand now why we attacked Iraq?<br /><br />Q: I think so. We attacked them because God wanted us to,r ight?<br />A: Yes.<br /><br />Q: But how did we know God wanted us to attack Iraq?<br />A: Well, you see, God personally speaks to George W. Bush and tells him what to do.<br /><br />Q: So basically, what you're saying is that we attacked Iraq because George W. Bush hears voices in his head?<br />A. Yes! You finally understand how the world works. Now close your eyes, make yourself comfortable, and go to sleep. Good night.<br /><br />Good night, Daddy.<br /></div></div>]]></body></post><post id="p13617" date="Posted: Sun Sep 28, 2003 6:00 am "><author>[sic]</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">That's great _shank.

It is Very difficult to positively identify the surface by just looking at it. So, how do we determine with any amount of certainty what type of mirror we are looking at? 
<br /><br />CONDUCT THIS SIMPLE TEST: Place the tip of your fingernail against the reflective surface and if there is a GAP between your fingernail and the image of the nail, then it is a GENUINE mirror. However, if your fingernail DIRECTLY TOUCHES the image of your nail, then BEWARE, IT IS A 2-WAY MIRROR! (there is someone seeing you from the other side).  The reason there is a gap on a real mirror, is because the silver is on the back of the mirror UNDER the glass. Whereas with a two-way mirror, the silver is on the surface. Keep it in mind! Make sure and check every time you enter in hotel rooms. May be someone is making a film on you.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p15645" date="Posted: Fri Nov 21, 2003 8:01 am "><author>Rayne</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">So basically, what you're saying is that we attacked Iraq because George W.

I offered to double-wrap, use plenty of AstroGlide, but she was still totally freaked over the idea of it. Then she made a deal with me: If I'd bend over for her strap-on, she'd bend over for me.

<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Hey,<br />This is a conversation between a father and a son...you will probably understand the reason why US attacked Iraq and how the world functions better after reading<br />this.<br /><br />Q: Daddy, why did we have to attack Iraq?<br />A: Because they had weapons of mass destruction,  honey.<br /><br />Q: But the inspectors didn't find any weapons of mass destruction.<br />A: That's because the Iraqis were hiding them.<br /><br />Q: And that's why we invaded Iraq?<br />A: Yep. Invasions always work better than  inspections.<br /><br />Q: But after we invaded them, we STILL didn't find any weapons  of mass destruction, did we?<br />A: That's because the weapons are so well hidden. Don't worry, we'll find something, probably right before the 2004 election.<br /><br />Q: Why did Iraq want all those weapons of mass  destruction?<br />A: To use them in a war, silly.<br /><br />Q: I'm confused. If they had all those weapons that they planned to use in a war, then why didn't they use any of those weapons when we  went to war with them?<br />A: Well, obviously they didn't want anyone to know they had  those weapons,so they chose to die by the thousands rather than defend themselves.<br /><br />Q: That doesn't make sense Daddy. Why would they choose to die  if they had all those big weapons to fight us back with?<br />A: It's a different culture. It's not supposed to make  sense.<br /><br />Q: I don't know about you, but I don't think they had any of those weapons our government said they did.<br />A: Well, you know, it doesn't matter whether or not they had those weapons. We had another good reason to invade them anyway.<br /><br />Q: And what was that?<br />A: Even if Iraq didn't have weapons of mass destruction, Saddam Hussein was a cruel dictator, which is another good reason to invade another country.<br /><br />Q: Why? What does a cruel dictator do that makes it OK to invade his country?<br />A: Well, for one thing, he tortured his own people.<br /><br />Q: Kind of like what they do in China?<br />A: Don't go comparing China to Iraq. China is a good economic competitor, where millions of people work for slave wages in sweatshops to make U.S. corporations richer.<br /><br />Q: So if a country lets its people be exploited for American corporate<br />gain, it's a good country, even if that country tortures people?<br />A: Right.<br /><br />Q: Why were people in Iraq being tortured?<br />A: For political crimes, mostly, like criticizing the  government. People who criticized the government in Iraq were sent to prison and tortured.<br /><br />Q: Isn't that exactly what happens in China?<br />A: I told you, China is different.<br /><br />Q: What's the difference between China and Iraq?<br />A: Well, for one thing, Iraq was ruled by the Ba'ath party, while China is Communist.<br /><br />Q: Didn't you once tell me Communists were bad?<br />A: No, just Cuban Communists are bad.<br /><br />Q: How are the Cuban Communists bad?<br />A: Well, for one thing, people who criticize the government in Cuba are sent to prison and tortured.<br /><br />Q: Like in Iraq?<br />A: Exactly.<br /><br />Q: And like in China, too?<br />A: I told you, China's a good economic competitor. Cuba, on the other hand, is not.<br /><br />Q: How come Cuba isn't a good economic competitor?<br />A: Well, you see, back in the early 1960s, our government passed some laws that made it illegal for Americans to trade or do any business with Cuba until they stopped being Communists and started being capitalists like us.<br /><br />Q: But if we got rid of those laws, opened up trade with Cuba,and started doing business with them, wouldn't that help the Cubans become capitalists?<br />A: Don't be a smart-ass.<br /><br />Q: I didn't think I was being one.<br />A: Well, anyway, they also don't have freedom of religion in Cuba.<br /><br />Q: Kind of like China and the @!#$ movement?<br />A: I told you, stop saying bad things about China. Anyway,  Saddam Hussein came to power through a military coup, so he's not really a legitimate leader anyway.<br /><br />Q: What's a military coup?<br />A: That's when a military general takes over the government of a country by force, instead of holding free elections like we do in the United States.<br /><br />Q: Didn't the ruler of Pakistan come to power by a military coup?<br />A: You mean General Pervez Musharraf? Uh, yeah, he did, but Pakistan is our friend.<br /><br />Q: Why is Pakistan our friend if their leader is illegitimate?<br />A: I never said Pervez Musharraf was illegitimate.<br /><br />Q: Didn't you just say a military general who comes to power by forcibly overthrowing the legitimate government of a nation is an illegitimate leader?<br />A: Only Saddam Hussein. Pervez Musharraf is our friend, because he helped us invade Afghanistan.<br /><br />Q: Why did we invade Afghanistan?<br />A: Because of what they did to us on September 11th.<br /><br />Q: What did Afghanistan do to us on September 11th?<br />A: Well, on September 11th, nineteen men, fifteen of them Saudi Arabians, hijacked four airplanes and flew three of them into buildings,killing over 3,000 Americans.<br /><br />Q: So how did Afghanistan figure into all that?<br />A: Afghanistan was where those bad men trained, under the oppressive rule of the Taliban.<br /><br />Q: Aren't the Taliban those bad radical Islamics who chopped off people's heads and hands?<br />A: Yes, that's exactly who they were. Not only did they chop off people's heads and hands, but they oppressed women, too.<br /><br />Q: Didn't the Bush administration giv e the Taliban 43 million dollars back in May of 2001?<br />A: Yes, but that money was a reward because they did such a good job fighting drugs.<br /><br />Q: Fighting drugs?<br />A: Yes, the Taliban were very helpful in stopping people from growing opium poppies.<br /><br />Q: How did they do such a good job?<br />A: Simple. If people were caught growing opium poppies, the Taliban would have their hands and heads cut off.<br /><br />Q: So, when the Taliban cut off people's heads and hands for growing flowers, that was OK, but not if they cut people's heads and hands off for other reasons?<br />A: Yes. It's OK with us if radical Islamic fundamentalists cut off people's hands for growing flowers, but it's cruel if they cut off people's hands for stealing bread.<br /><br />Q: Don't they also cut off people's hands and heads in Saudi Arabia?<br />A: That's different. Afghanistan was ruled by a tyrannical patriarchy that oppressed women and forced them to wear burqas whenever they  were in public, with death by stoning as the penalty for women who did not comply.<br /><br />Q: Don't Saudi women have to wear burqas in public,  too?<br />A: No, Saudi women merely wear a traditional Islamic body overing.<br /><br />Q: What's the difference?<br />A: The traditional Islamic co! vering worn by Saudi women is a modest yet fashionable garment that covers all of a woman's body xcept for her eyes and fingers. The burqa, on the other hand, is an evil tool of patriarchal oppression that covers all of a woman's body except for her eyes<br />and fingers.<br /><br />Q: It sounds like the same thing with a different  name.<br />A: Now, don't go comparing Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia. The Saudis are our friends.<br /><br />Q: But I thought you said 15 of the 19 hijackers on September 11th were from Saudi Arabia.<br />A: Yes, but they trained in Afghanistan.<br /><br />Q: Who trained them?<br />A: A very bad man named Osama bin Laden.<br /><br />Q: Was he from Afghanist! an?<br />A: Uh, no, he was from Saudi Arabia too. But he was a bad man, a very bad man.<br /><br />Q: I seem to recall he was our friend once.<br />A: Only when we helped him and the mujahadeen repel the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan back in the 1980s.<br /><br />Q: Who are the Soviets? Was that the Evil Communist Empire  Ronald Reagan talked about?<br />A: There are no more Soviets. The Soviet Union broke up in 1990 or there abouts, and now they have elections and capitalism like us. We call them Russians now.<br /><br />Q: So the Soviets, I mean, the Russians, are now our  friends?<br />A: Well, not really. You see, they were our friends for many years after they stopped being Soviets, bu t then they decided not to support our invasion of Iraq, so we're mad at them now. We're also mad at  the French and the Germans because they didn't help us invade Iraqe ither.<br /><br />Q: So the French and Germans are evil, too?<br />A: Not exactly evil, but just bad enough that we had to rename French fries and French toast to Freedom Fries and Freedom Toast.<br /><br />Q: Do we always rename foods whenever another country doesn't do what we want them to do?<br />A: No, we just do that to our friends. Our enemies, we  invade.<br /><br />Q: But wasn't Iraq one of our friends back in the  1980s?<br />A: Well, yeah. For a while.<br /><br />Q: Was Saddam Hussein ruler of Iraq back then?<br />A: Yes, but at the time he was fighting against Iran, which made him our friend, temporarily.<br /><br />Q: Why did that make him our friend?<br />A: Because at that time, Iran was our enemy.<br /><br />Q: Isn't that when he gassed the Kurds?<br />A: Yeah, but since he was fighting against Iran at the time, we looked the other way, to show him we were his friend.<br /><br />Q: So anyone who fights against one of our enemies automatically becomes our friend?<br />A: Most of the time, yes.<br /><br />Q: And anyone who fights against one of our friends is automatically an enemy?<br />A: Sometimes that's true, t! oo. However, if American corporations can profit by selling weapons to both sides at the same time, all  the better.<br /><br />Q: Why?<br />A: Because war is good for the economy, which meanswar is good for America. Also, since God is on America's side, anyone who opposes war is  a godless un-American Communist. Do you understand now why we attacked Iraq?<br /><br />Q: I think so. We attacked them because God wanted us to,r ight?<br />A: Yes.<br /><br />Q: But how did we know God wanted us to attack Iraq?<br />A: Well, you see, God personally speaks to George W. Bush and tells him what to do.<br /><br />Q: So basically, what you're saying is that we attacked Iraq because George W. Bush hears voices in his head?<br />A. Yes! You finally understand how the world works. Now close your eyes, make yourself comfortable, and go to sleep. Good night.<br /><br />Good night, Daddy.<br /></div></div>]]></body></post><post id="p13617" date="Posted: Sun Sep 28, 2003 6:00 am "><author>[sic]</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">That's great _shank.

It is Very difficult to positively identify the surface by just looking at it. So, how do we determine with any amount of certainty what type of mirror we are looking at? 
<br /><br />CONDUCT THIS SIMPLE TEST: Place the tip of your fingernail against the reflective surface and if there is a GAP between your fingernail and the image of the nail, then it is a GENUINE mirror. However, if your fingernail DIRECTLY TOUCHES the image of your nail, then BEWARE, IT IS A 2-WAY MIRROR! (there is someone seeing you from the other side).  The reason there is a gap on a real mirror, is because the silver is on the back of the mirror UNDER the glass. Whereas with a two-way mirror, the silver is on the surface. Keep it in mind! Make sure and check every time you enter in hotel rooms. May be someone is making a film on you.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p15645" date="Posted: Fri Nov 21, 2003 8:01 am "><author>Rayne</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">So basically, what you're saying is that we attacked Iraq because George W.

  <div class="quotecontent">The lizard brain<br /><br />Maybe you remember way back in school when you learned that the human brain still contains a prehistoric lizard brain at its center. This is the key to understanding women and what you can expect from them.<br /><br />Women still have direct contact with the lizard brain, something which men have been able to shut down about a trillion centuries ago.<br /><br />Have you ever noticed how women get cold very easily even if the temperature is only 1 µC below optimum? That's because lizards are cold-blooded, and a woman's lizard brain is telling her that she better get to a warm place quickly or her muscles will freeze up and her heart will stop beating.<br /><br />Have you noticed how a woman always seems to be thinking about two things at once? That's because a lizard's eyes point in two different directions, so it always has to process two completely different scenes.<br /><br />Have you noticed how two women can hate each other and have a serious fight, even if they don't know each other and they are sitting on opposite sides of the room? Lizards are very territorial and fight with each other by standing in one place and making threatening movements.<br /><br />Have you ever noticed how a woman drives? It's that two-direction eye problem again. That's why she thinks that it's possible to drive at high speed on a roundabout while looking in the mirror and adjusting her make-up.<br /><br />Have you noticed how a woman can sit somewhere completely happy, then suddenly out of nowhere she begins to cut you to pieces with her tongue? Well, just watch a lizard catch flies and you will know where that comes from.<br /><br />Women can lay in the sun on a big rock all day and never get bored.<br /><br />If a woman gets the chance, and she thinks that she can get away with it, she will color her hair orange and green and get it styled into a spiky hairdo. This is definitely a lizard haircut.<br /><br />I'm sure that there are hundreds of examples. The point is, the lizard brain theory explains everything. I am expecting to win the Nobel Prize this year.</div>

<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Hey,<br />This is a conversation between a father and a son...you will probably understand the reason why US attacked Iraq and how the world functions better after reading<br />this.<br /><br />Q: Daddy, why did we have to attack Iraq?<br />A: Because they had weapons of mass destruction,  honey.<br /><br />Q: But the inspectors didn't find any weapons of mass destruction.<br />A: That's because the Iraqis were hiding them.<br /><br />Q: And that's why we invaded Iraq?<br />A: Yep. Invasions always work better than  inspections.<br /><br />Q: But after we invaded them, we STILL didn't find any weapons  of mass destruction, did we?<br />A: That's because the weapons are so well hidden. Don't worry, we'll find something, probably right before the 2004 election.<br /><br />Q: Why did Iraq want all those weapons of mass  destruction?<br />A: To use them in a war, silly.<br /><br />Q: I'm confused. If they had all those weapons that they planned to use in a war, then why didn't they use any of those weapons when we  went to war with them?<br />A: Well, obviously they didn't want anyone to know they had  those weapons,so they chose to die by the thousands rather than defend themselves.<br /><br />Q: That doesn't make sense Daddy. Why would they choose to die  if they had all those big weapons to fight us back with?<br />A: It's a different culture. It's not supposed to make  sense.<br /><br />Q: I don't know about you, but I don't think they had any of those weapons our government said they did.<br />A: Well, you know, it doesn't matter whether or not they had those weapons. We had another good reason to invade them anyway.<br /><br />Q: And what was that?<br />A: Even if Iraq didn't have weapons of mass destruction, Saddam Hussein was a cruel dictator, which is another good reason to invade another country.<br /><br />Q: Why? What does a cruel dictator do that makes it OK to invade his country?<br />A: Well, for one thing, he tortured his own people.<br /><br />Q: Kind of like what they do in China?<br />A: Don't go comparing China to Iraq. China is a good economic competitor, where millions of people work for slave wages in sweatshops to make U.S. corporations richer.<br /><br />Q: So if a country lets its people be exploited for American corporate<br />gain, it's a good country, even if that country tortures people?<br />A: Right.<br /><br />Q: Why were people in Iraq being tortured?<br />A: For political crimes, mostly, like criticizing the  government. People who criticized the government in Iraq were sent to prison and tortured.<br /><br />Q: Isn't that exactly what happens in China?<br />A: I told you, China is different.<br /><br />Q: What's the difference between China and Iraq?<br />A: Well, for one thing, Iraq was ruled by the Ba'ath party, while China is Communist.<br /><br />Q: Didn't you once tell me Communists were bad?<br />A: No, just Cuban Communists are bad.<br /><br />Q: How are the Cuban Communists bad?<br />A: Well, for one thing, people who criticize the government in Cuba are sent to prison and tortured.<br /><br />Q: Like in Iraq?<br />A: Exactly.<br /><br />Q: And like in China, too?<br />A: I told you, China's a good economic competitor. Cuba, on the other hand, is not.<br /><br />Q: How come Cuba isn't a good economic competitor?<br />A: Well, you see, back in the early 1960s, our government passed some laws that made it illegal for Americans to trade or do any business with Cuba until they stopped being Communists and started being capitalists like us.<br /><br />Q: But if we got rid of those laws, opened up trade with Cuba,and started doing business with them, wouldn't that help the Cubans become capitalists?<br />A: Don't be a smart-ass.<br /><br />Q: I didn't think I was being one.<br />A: Well, anyway, they also don't have freedom of religion in Cuba.<br /><br />Q: Kind of like China and the @!#$ movement?<br />A: I told you, stop saying bad things about China. Anyway,  Saddam Hussein came to power through a military coup, so he's not really a legitimate leader anyway.<br /><br />Q: What's a military coup?<br />A: That's when a military general takes over the government of a country by force, instead of holding free elections like we do in the United States.<br /><br />Q: Didn't the ruler of Pakistan come to power by a military coup?<br />A: You mean General Pervez Musharraf? Uh, yeah, he did, but Pakistan is our friend.<br /><br />Q: Why is Pakistan our friend if their leader is illegitimate?<br />A: I never said Pervez Musharraf was illegitimate.<br /><br />Q: Didn't you just say a military general who comes to power by forcibly overthrowing the legitimate government of a nation is an illegitimate leader?<br />A: Only Saddam Hussein. Pervez Musharraf is our friend, because he helped us invade Afghanistan.<br /><br />Q: Why did we invade Afghanistan?<br />A: Because of what they did to us on September 11th.<br /><br />Q: What did Afghanistan do to us on September 11th?<br />A: Well, on September 11th, nineteen men, fifteen of them Saudi Arabians, hijacked four airplanes and flew three of them into buildings,killing over 3,000 Americans.<br /><br />Q: So how did Afghanistan figure into all that?<br />A: Afghanistan was where those bad men trained, under the oppressive rule of the Taliban.<br /><br />Q: Aren't the Taliban those bad radical Islamics who chopped off people's heads and hands?<br />A: Yes, that's exactly who they were. Not only did they chop off people's heads and hands, but they oppressed women, too.<br /><br />Q: Didn't the Bush administration giv e the Taliban 43 million dollars back in May of 2001?<br />A: Yes, but that money was a reward because they did such a good job fighting drugs.<br /><br />Q: Fighting drugs?<br />A: Yes, the Taliban were very helpful in stopping people from growing opium poppies.<br /><br />Q: How did they do such a good job?<br />A: Simple. If people were caught growing opium poppies, the Taliban would have their hands and heads cut off.<br /><br />Q: So, when the Taliban cut off people's heads and hands for growing flowers, that was OK, but not if they cut people's heads and hands off for other reasons?<br />A: Yes. It's OK with us if radical Islamic fundamentalists cut off people's hands for growing flowers, but it's cruel if they cut off people's hands for stealing bread.<br /><br />Q: Don't they also cut off people's hands and heads in Saudi Arabia?<br />A: That's different. Afghanistan was ruled by a tyrannical patriarchy that oppressed women and forced them to wear burqas whenever they  were in public, with death by stoning as the penalty for women who did not comply.<br /><br />Q: Don't Saudi women have to wear burqas in public,  too?<br />A: No, Saudi women merely wear a traditional Islamic body overing.<br /><br />Q: What's the difference?<br />A: The traditional Islamic co! vering worn by Saudi women is a modest yet fashionable garment that covers all of a woman's body xcept for her eyes and fingers. The burqa, on the other hand, is an evil tool of patriarchal oppression that covers all of a woman's body except for her eyes<br />and fingers.<br /><br />Q: It sounds like the same thing with a different  name.<br />A: Now, don't go comparing Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia. The Saudis are our friends.<br /><br />Q: But I thought you said 15 of the 19 hijackers on September 11th were from Saudi Arabia.<br />A: Yes, but they trained in Afghanistan.<br /><br />Q: Who trained them?<br />A: A very bad man named Osama bin Laden.<br /><br />Q: Was he from Afghanist! an?<br />A: Uh, no, he was from Saudi Arabia too. But he was a bad man, a very bad man.<br /><br />Q: I seem to recall he was our friend once.<br />A: Only when we helped him and the mujahadeen repel the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan back in the 1980s.<br /><br />Q: Who are the Soviets? Was that the Evil Communist Empire  Ronald Reagan talked about?<br />A: There are no more Soviets. The Soviet Union broke up in 1990 or there abouts, and now they have elections and capitalism like us. We call them Russians now.<br /><br />Q: So the Soviets, I mean, the Russians, are now our  friends?<br />A: Well, not really. You see, they were our friends for many years after they stopped being Soviets, bu t then they decided not to support our invasion of Iraq, so we're mad at them now. We're also mad at  the French and the Germans because they didn't help us invade Iraqe ither.<br /><br />Q: So the French and Germans are evil, too?<br />A: Not exactly evil, but just bad enough that we had to rename French fries and French toast to Freedom Fries and Freedom Toast.<br /><br />Q: Do we always rename foods whenever another country doesn't do what we want them to do?<br />A: No, we just do that to our friends. Our enemies, we  invade.<br /><br />Q: But wasn't Iraq one of our friends back in the  1980s?<br />A: Well, yeah. For a while.<br /><br />Q: Was Saddam Hussein ruler of Iraq back then?<br />A: Yes, but at the time he was fighting against Iran, which made him our friend, temporarily.<br /><br />Q: Why did that make him our friend?<br />A: Because at that time, Iran was our enemy.<br /><br />Q: Isn't that when he gassed the Kurds?<br />A: Yeah, but since he was fighting against Iran at the time, we looked the other way, to show him we were his friend.<br /><br />Q: So anyone who fights against one of our enemies automatically becomes our friend?<br />A: Most of the time, yes.<br /><br />Q: And anyone who fights against one of our friends is automatically an enemy?<br />A: Sometimes that's true, t! oo. However, if American corporations can profit by selling weapons to both sides at the same time, all  the better.<br /><br />Q: Why?<br />A: Because war is good for the economy, which meanswar is good for America. Also, since God is on America's side, anyone who opposes war is  a godless un-American Communist. Do you understand now why we attacked Iraq?<br /><br />Q: I think so. We attacked them because God wanted us to,r ight?<br />A: Yes.<br /><br />Q: But how did we know God wanted us to attack Iraq?<br />A: Well, you see, God personally speaks to George W. Bush and tells him what to do.<br /><br />Q: So basically, what you're saying is that we attacked Iraq because George W. Bush hears voices in his head?<br />A. Yes! You finally understand how the world works. Now close your eyes, make yourself comfortable, and go to sleep. Good night.<br /><br />Good night, Daddy.<br /></div></div>]]></body></post><post id="p13617" date="Posted: Sun Sep 28, 2003 6:00 am "><author>[sic]</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">That's great _shank.

It is Very difficult to positively identify the surface by just looking at it. So, how do we determine with any amount of certainty what type of mirror we are looking at? 
<br /><br />CONDUCT THIS SIMPLE TEST: Place the tip of your fingernail against the reflective surface and if there is a GAP between your fingernail and the image of the nail, then it is a GENUINE mirror. However, if your fingernail DIRECTLY TOUCHES the image of your nail, then BEWARE, IT IS A 2-WAY MIRROR! (there is someone seeing you from the other side).  The reason there is a gap on a real mirror, is because the silver is on the back of the mirror UNDER the glass. Whereas with a two-way mirror, the silver is on the surface. Keep it in mind! Make sure and check every time you enter in hotel rooms. May be someone is making a film on you.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p15645" date="Posted: Fri Nov 21, 2003 8:01 am "><author>Rayne</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">So basically, what you're saying is that we attacked Iraq because George W.

  <div class="quotecontent">The lizard brain<br /><br />Maybe you remember way back in school when you learned that the human brain still contains a prehistoric lizard brain at its center. This is the key to understanding women and what you can expect from them.<br /><br />Women still have direct contact with the lizard brain, something which men have been able to shut down about a trillion centuries ago.<br /><br />Have you ever noticed how women get cold very easily even if the temperature is only 1 µC below optimum? That's because lizards are cold-blooded, and a woman's lizard brain is telling her that she better get to a warm place quickly or her muscles will freeze up and her heart will stop beating.<br /><br />Have you noticed how a woman always seems to be thinking about two things at once? That's because a lizard's eyes point in two different directions, so it always has to process two completely different scenes.<br /><br />Have you noticed how two women can hate each other and have a serious fight, even if they don't know each other and they are sitting on opposite sides of the room? Lizards are very territorial and fight with each other by standing in one place and making threatening movements.<br /><br />Have you ever noticed how a woman drives? It's that two-direction eye problem again. That's why she thinks that it's possible to drive at high speed on a roundabout while looking in the mirror and adjusting her make-up.<br /><br />Have you noticed how a woman can sit somewhere completely happy, then suddenly out of nowhere she begins to cut you to pieces with her tongue? Well, just watch a lizard catch flies and you will know where that comes from.<br /><br />Women can lay in the sun on a big rock all day and never get bored.<br /><br />If a woman gets the chance, and she thinks that she can get away with it, she will color her hair orange and green and get it styled into a spiky hairdo. This is definitely a lizard haircut.<br /><br />I'm sure that there are hundreds of examples. The point is, the lizard brain theory explains everything. I am expecting to win the Nobel Prize this year.</div>

<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Hey,<br />This is a conversation between a father and a son...you will probably understand the reason why US attacked Iraq and how the world functions better after reading<br />this.<br /><br />Q: Daddy, why did we have to attack Iraq?<br />A: Because they had weapons of mass destruction,  honey.<br /><br />Q: But the inspectors didn't find any weapons of mass destruction.<br />A: That's because the Iraqis were hiding them.<br /><br />Q: And that's why we invaded Iraq?<br />A: Yep. Invasions always work better than  inspections.<br /><br />Q: But after we invaded them, we STILL didn't find any weapons  of mass destruction, did we?<br />A: That's because the weapons are so well hidden. Don't worry, we'll find something, probably right before the 2004 election.<br /><br />Q: Why did Iraq want all those weapons of mass  destruction?<br />A: To use them in a war, silly.<br /><br />Q: I'm confused. If they had all those weapons that they planned to use in a war, then why didn't they use any of those weapons when we  went to war with them?<br />A: Well, obviously they didn't want anyone to know they had  those weapons,so they chose to die by the thousands rather than defend themselves.<br /><br />Q: That doesn't make sense Daddy. Why would they choose to die  if they had all those big weapons to fight us back with?<br />A: It's a different culture. It's not supposed to make  sense.<br /><br />Q: I don't know about you, but I don't think they had any of those weapons our government said they did.<br />A: Well, you know, it doesn't matter whether or not they had those weapons. We had another good reason to invade them anyway.<br /><br />Q: And what was that?<br />A: Even if Iraq didn't have weapons of mass destruction, Saddam Hussein was a cruel dictator, which is another good reason to invade another country.<br /><br />Q: Why? What does a cruel dictator do that makes it OK to invade his country?<br />A: Well, for one thing, he tortured his own people.<br /><br />Q: Kind of like what they do in China?<br />A: Don't go comparing China to Iraq. China is a good economic competitor, where millions of people work for slave wages in sweatshops to make U.S. corporations richer.<br /><br />Q: So if a country lets its people be exploited for American corporate<br />gain, it's a good country, even if that country tortures people?<br />A: Right.<br /><br />Q: Why were people in Iraq being tortured?<br />A: For political crimes, mostly, like criticizing the  government. People who criticized the government in Iraq were sent to prison and tortured.<br /><br />Q: Isn't that exactly what happens in China?<br />A: I told you, China is different.<br /><br />Q: What's the difference between China and Iraq?<br />A: Well, for one thing, Iraq was ruled by the Ba'ath party, while China is Communist.<br /><br />Q: Didn't you once tell me Communists were bad?<br />A: No, just Cuban Communists are bad.<br /><br />Q: How are the Cuban Communists bad?<br />A: Well, for one thing, people who criticize the government in Cuba are sent to prison and tortured.<br /><br />Q: Like in Iraq?<br />A: Exactly.<br /><br />Q: And like in China, too?<br />A: I told you, China's a good economic competitor. Cuba, on the other hand, is not.<br /><br />Q: How come Cuba isn't a good economic competitor?<br />A: Well, you see, back in the early 1960s, our government passed some laws that made it illegal for Americans to trade or do any business with Cuba until they stopped being Communists and started being capitalists like us.<br /><br />Q: But if we got rid of those laws, opened up trade with Cuba,and started doing business with them, wouldn't that help the Cubans become capitalists?<br />A: Don't be a smart-ass.<br /><br />Q: I didn't think I was being one.<br />A: Well, anyway, they also don't have freedom of religion in Cuba.<br /><br />Q: Kind of like China and the @!#$ movement?<br />A: I told you, stop saying bad things about China. Anyway,  Saddam Hussein came to power through a military coup, so he's not really a legitimate leader anyway.<br /><br />Q: What's a military coup?<br />A: That's when a military general takes over the government of a country by force, instead of holding free elections like we do in the United States.<br /><br />Q: Didn't the ruler of Pakistan come to power by a military coup?<br />A: You mean General Pervez Musharraf? Uh, yeah, he did, but Pakistan is our friend.<br /><br />Q: Why is Pakistan our friend if their leader is illegitimate?<br />A: I never said Pervez Musharraf was illegitimate.<br /><br />Q: Didn't you just say a military general who comes to power by forcibly overthrowing the legitimate government of a nation is an illegitimate leader?<br />A: Only Saddam Hussein. Pervez Musharraf is our friend, because he helped us invade Afghanistan.<br /><br />Q: Why did we invade Afghanistan?<br />A: Because of what they did to us on September 11th.<br /><br />Q: What did Afghanistan do to us on September 11th?<br />A: Well, on September 11th, nineteen men, fifteen of them Saudi Arabians, hijacked four airplanes and flew three of them into buildings,killing over 3,000 Americans.<br /><br />Q: So how did Afghanistan figure into all that?<br />A: Afghanistan was where those bad men trained, under the oppressive rule of the Taliban.<br /><br />Q: Aren't the Taliban those bad radical Islamics who chopped off people's heads and hands?<br />A: Yes, that's exactly who they were. Not only did they chop off people's heads and hands, but they oppressed women, too.<br /><br />Q: Didn't the Bush administration giv e the Taliban 43 million dollars back in May of 2001?<br />A: Yes, but that money was a reward because they did such a good job fighting drugs.<br /><br />Q: Fighting drugs?<br />A: Yes, the Taliban were very helpful in stopping people from growing opium poppies.<br /><br />Q: How did they do such a good job?<br />A: Simple. If people were caught growing opium poppies, the Taliban would have their hands and heads cut off.<br /><br />Q: So, when the Taliban cut off people's heads and hands for growing flowers, that was OK, but not if they cut people's heads and hands off for other reasons?<br />A: Yes. It's OK with us if radical Islamic fundamentalists cut off people's hands for growing flowers, but it's cruel if they cut off people's hands for stealing bread.<br /><br />Q: Don't they also cut off people's hands and heads in Saudi Arabia?<br />A: That's different. Afghanistan was ruled by a tyrannical patriarchy that oppressed women and forced them to wear burqas whenever they  were in public, with death by stoning as the penalty for women who did not comply.<br /><br />Q: Don't Saudi women have to wear burqas in public,  too?<br />A: No, Saudi women merely wear a traditional Islamic body overing.<br /><br />Q: What's the difference?<br />A: The traditional Islamic co! vering worn by Saudi women is a modest yet fashionable garment that covers all of a woman's body xcept for her eyes and fingers. The burqa, on the other hand, is an evil tool of patriarchal oppression that covers all of a woman's body except for her eyes<br />and fingers.<br /><br />Q: It sounds like the same thing with a different  name.<br />A: Now, don't go comparing Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia. The Saudis are our friends.<br /><br />Q: But I thought you said 15 of the 19 hijackers on September 11th were from Saudi Arabia.<br />A: Yes, but they trained in Afghanistan.<br /><br />Q: Who trained them?<br />A: A very bad man named Osama bin Laden.<br /><br />Q: Was he from Afghanist! an?<br />A: Uh, no, he was from Saudi Arabia too. But he was a bad man, a very bad man.<br /><br />Q: I seem to recall he was our friend once.<br />A: Only when we helped him and the mujahadeen repel the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan back in the 1980s.<br /><br />Q: Who are the Soviets? Was that the Evil Communist Empire  Ronald Reagan talked about?<br />A: There are no more Soviets. The Soviet Union broke up in 1990 or there abouts, and now they have elections and capitalism like us. We call them Russians now.<br /><br />Q: So the Soviets, I mean, the Russians, are now our  friends?<br />A: Well, not really. You see, they were our friends for many years after they stopped being Soviets, bu t then they decided not to support our invasion of Iraq, so we're mad at them now. We're also mad at  the French and the Germans because they didn't help us invade Iraqe ither.<br /><br />Q: So the French and Germans are evil, too?<br />A: Not exactly evil, but just bad enough that we had to rename French fries and French toast to Freedom Fries and Freedom Toast.<br /><br />Q: Do we always rename foods whenever another country doesn't do what we want them to do?<br />A: No, we just do that to our friends. Our enemies, we  invade.<br /><br />Q: But wasn't Iraq one of our friends back in the  1980s?<br />A: Well, yeah. For a while.<br /><br />Q: Was Saddam Hussein ruler of Iraq back then?<br />A: Yes, but at the time he was fighting against Iran, which made him our friend, temporarily.<br /><br />Q: Why did that make him our friend?<br />A: Because at that time, Iran was our enemy.<br /><br />Q: Isn't that when he gassed the Kurds?<br />A: Yeah, but since he was fighting against Iran at the time, we looked the other way, to show him we were his friend.<br /><br />Q: So anyone who fights against one of our enemies automatically becomes our friend?<br />A: Most of the time, yes.<br /><br />Q: And anyone who fights against one of our friends is automatically an enemy?<br />A: Sometimes that's true, t! oo. However, if American corporations can profit by selling weapons to both sides at the same time, all  the better.<br /><br />Q: Why?<br />A: Because war is good for the economy, which meanswar is good for America. Also, since God is on America's side, anyone who opposes war is  a godless un-American Communist. Do you understand now why we attacked Iraq?<br /><br />Q: I think so. We attacked them because God wanted us to,r ight?<br />A: Yes.<br /><br />Q: But how did we know God wanted us to attack Iraq?<br />A: Well, you see, God personally speaks to George W. Bush and tells him what to do.<br /><br />Q: So basically, what you're saying is that we attacked Iraq because George W. Bush hears voices in his head?<br />A. Yes! You finally understand how the world works. Now close your eyes, make yourself comfortable, and go to sleep. Good night.<br /><br />Good night, Daddy.<br /></div></div>]]></body></post><post id="p13617" date="Posted: Sun Sep 28, 2003 6:00 am "><author>[sic]</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">That's great _shank.

It is Very difficult to positively identify the surface by just looking at it. So, how do we determine with any amount of certainty what type of mirror we are looking at? 
<br /><br />CONDUCT THIS SIMPLE TEST: Place the tip of your fingernail against the reflective surface and if there is a GAP between your fingernail and the image of the nail, then it is a GENUINE mirror. However, if your fingernail DIRECTLY TOUCHES the image of your nail, then BEWARE, IT IS A 2-WAY MIRROR! (there is someone seeing you from the other side).  The reason there is a gap on a real mirror, is because the silver is on the back of the mirror UNDER the glass. Whereas with a two-way mirror, the silver is on the surface. Keep it in mind! Make sure and check every time you enter in hotel rooms. May be someone is making a film on you.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p15645" date="Posted: Fri Nov 21, 2003 8:01 am "><author>Rayne</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">So basically, what you're saying is that we attacked Iraq because George W.

  <div class="quotecontent">The lizard brain<br /><br />Maybe you remember way back in school when you learned that the human brain still contains a prehistoric lizard brain at its center. This is the key to understanding women and what you can expect from them.<br /><br />Women still have direct contact with the lizard brain, something which men have been able to shut down about a trillion centuries ago.<br /><br />Have you ever noticed how women get cold very easily even if the temperature is only 1 µC below optimum? That's because lizards are cold-blooded, and a woman's lizard brain is telling her that she better get to a warm place quickly or her muscles will freeze up and her heart will stop beating.<br /><br />Have you noticed how a woman always seems to be thinking about two things at once? That's because a lizard's eyes point in two different directions, so it always has to process two completely different scenes.<br /><br />Have you noticed how two women can hate each other and have a serious fight, even if they don't know each other and they are sitting on opposite sides of the room? Lizards are very territorial and fight with each other by standing in one place and making threatening movements.<br /><br />Have you ever noticed how a woman drives? It's that two-direction eye problem again. That's why she thinks that it's possible to drive at high speed on a roundabout while looking in the mirror and adjusting her make-up.<br /><br />Have you noticed how a woman can sit somewhere completely happy, then suddenly out of nowhere she begins to cut you to pieces with her tongue? Well, just watch a lizard catch flies and you will know where that comes from.<br /><br />Women can lay in the sun on a big rock all day and never get bored.<br /><br />If a woman gets the chance, and she thinks that she can get away with it, she will color her hair orange and green and get it styled into a spiky hairdo. This is definitely a lizard haircut.<br /><br />I'm sure that there are hundreds of examples. The point is, the lizard brain theory explains everything. I am expecting to win the Nobel Prize this year.</div>

If they had all those weapons that they planned to use in a war, then why didn't they use any of those weapons when we  went to war with them?<br />A: Well, obviously they didn't want anyone to know they had  those weapons,so they chose to die by the thousands rather than defend themselves.<br /><br />Q: That doesn't make sense Daddy. Why would they choose to die  if they had all those big weapons to fight us back with?<br />A: It's a different culture. It's not supposed to make  sense.<br /><br />Q: I don't know about you, but I don't think they had any of those weapons our government said they did.<br />A: Well, you know, it doesn't matter whether or not they had those weapons. We had another good reason to invade them anyway.<br /><br />Q: And what was that?<br />A: Even if Iraq didn't have weapons of mass destruction, Saddam Hussein was a cruel dictator, which is another good reason to invade another country.<br /><br />Q: Why? What does a cruel dictator do that makes it OK to invade his country?<br />A: Well, for one thing, he tortured his own people.<br /><br />Q: Kind of like what they do in China?<br />A: Don't go comparing China to Iraq. China is a good economic competitor, where millions of people work for slave wages in sweatshops to make U.S. corporations richer.<br /><br />Q: So if a country lets its people be exploited for American corporate<br />gain, it's a good country, even if that country tortures people?<br />A: Right.<br /><br />Q: Why were people in Iraq being tortured?<br />A: For political crimes, mostly, like criticizing the  government. People who criticized the government in Iraq were sent to prison and tortured.<br /><br />Q: Isn't that exactly what happens in China?<br />A: I told you, China is different.<br /><br />Q: What's the difference between China and Iraq?<br />A: Well, for one thing, Iraq was ruled by the Ba'ath party, while China is Communist.<br /><br />Q: Didn't you once tell me Communists were bad?<br />A: No, just Cuban Communists are bad.<br /><br />Q: How are the Cuban Communists bad?<br />A: Well, for one thing, people who criticize the government in Cuba are sent to prison and tortured.<br /><br />Q: Like in Iraq?<br />A: Exactly.<br /><br />Q: And like in China, too?<br />A: I told you, China's a good economic competitor. Cuba, on the other hand, is not.<br /><br />Q: How come Cuba isn't a good economic competitor?<br />A: Well, you see, back in the early 1960s, our government passed some laws that made it illegal for Americans to trade or do any business with Cuba until they stopped being Communists and started being capitalists like us.<br /><br />Q: But if we got rid of those laws, opened up trade with Cuba,and started doing business with them, wouldn't that help the Cubans become capitalists?<br />A: Don't be a smart-ass.<br /><br />Q: I didn't think I was being one.<br />A: Well, anyway, they also don't have freedom of religion in Cuba.<br /><br />Q: Kind of like China and the @!#$ movement?<br />A: I told you, stop saying bad things about China. Anyway,  Saddam Hussein came to power through a military coup, so he's not really a legitimate leader anyway.<br /><br />Q: What's a military coup?<br />A: That's when a military general takes over the government of a country by force, instead of holding free elections like we do in the United States.<br /><br />Q: Didn't the ruler of Pakistan come to power by a military coup?<br />A: You mean General Pervez Musharraf? Uh, yeah, he did, but Pakistan is our friend.<br /><br />Q: Why is Pakistan our friend if their leader is illegitimate?<br />A: I never said Pervez Musharraf was illegitimate.<br /><br />Q: Didn't you just say a military general who comes to power by forcibly overthrowing the legitimate government of a nation is an illegitimate leader?<br />A: Only Saddam Hussein. Pervez Musharraf is our friend, because he helped us invade Afghanistan.<br /><br />Q: Why did we invade Afghanistan?<br />A: Because of what they did to us on September 11th.<br /><br />Q: What did Afghanistan do to us on September 11th?<br />A: Well, on September 11th, nineteen men, fifteen of them Saudi Arabians, hijacked four airplanes and flew three of them into buildings,killing over 3,000 Americans.<br /><br />Q: So how did Afghanistan figure into all that?<br />A: Afghanistan was where those bad men trained, under the oppressive rule of the Taliban.<br /><br />Q: Aren't the Taliban those bad radical Islamics who chopped off people's heads and hands?<br />A: Yes, that's exactly who they were. Not only did they chop off people's heads and hands, but they oppressed women, too.<br /><br />Q: Didn't the Bush administration giv e the Taliban 43 million dollars back in May of 2001?<br />A: Yes, but that money was a reward because they did such a good job fighting drugs.<br /><br />Q: Fighting drugs?<br />A: Yes, the Taliban were very helpful in stopping people from growing opium poppies.<br /><br />Q: How did they do such a good job?<br />A: Simple. If people were caught growing opium poppies, the Taliban would have their hands and heads cut off.<br /><br />Q: So, when the Taliban cut off people's heads and hands for growing flowers, that was OK, but not if they cut people's heads and hands off for other reasons?<br />A: Yes. It's OK with us if radical Islamic fundamentalists cut off people's hands for growing flowers, but it's cruel if they cut off people's hands for stealing bread.<br /><br />Q: Don't they also cut off people's hands and heads in Saudi Arabia?<br />A: That's different. Afghanistan was ruled by a tyrannical patriarchy that oppressed women and forced them to wear burqas whenever they  were in public, with death by stoning as the penalty for women who did not comply.<br /><br />Q: Don't Saudi women have to wear burqas in public,  too?<br />A: No, Saudi women merely wear a traditional Islamic body overing.<br /><br />Q: What's the difference?<br />A: The traditional Islamic co! vering worn by Saudi women is a modest yet fashionable garment that covers all of a woman's body xcept for her eyes and fingers. The burqa, on the other hand, is an evil tool of patriarchal oppression that covers all of a woman's body except for her eyes<br />and fingers.<br /><br />Q: It sounds like the same thing with a different  name.<br />A: Now, don't go comparing Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia. The Saudis are our friends.<br /><br />Q: But I thought you said 15 of the 19 hijackers on September 11th were from Saudi Arabia.<br />A: Yes, but they trained in Afghanistan.<br /><br />Q: Who trained them?<br />A: A very bad man named Osama bin Laden.<br /><br />Q: Was he from Afghanist! an?<br />A: Uh, no, he was from Saudi Arabia too. But he was a bad man, a very bad man.<br /><br />Q: I seem to recall he was our friend once.<br />A: Only when we helped him and the mujahadeen repel the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan back in the 1980s.<br /><br />Q: Who are the Soviets? Was that the Evil Communist Empire  Ronald Reagan talked about?<br />A: There are no more Soviets. The Soviet Union broke up in 1990 or there abouts, and now they have elections and capitalism like us. We call them Russians now.<br /><br />Q: So the Soviets, I mean, the Russians, are now our  friends?<br />A: Well, not really. You see, they were our friends for many years after they stopped being Soviets, bu t then they decided not to support our invasion of Iraq, so we're mad at them now. We're also mad at  the French and the Germans because they didn't help us invade Iraqe ither.<br /><br />Q: So the French and Germans are evil, too?<br />A: Not exactly evil, but just bad enough that we had to rename French fries and French toast to Freedom Fries and Freedom Toast.<br /><br />Q: Do we always rename foods whenever another country doesn't do what we want them to do?<br />A: No, we just do that to our friends. Our enemies, we  invade.<br /><br />Q: But wasn't Iraq one of our friends back in the  1980s?<br />A: Well, yeah. For a while.<br /><br />Q: Was Saddam Hussein ruler of Iraq back then?<br />A: Yes, but at the time he was fighting against Iran, which made him our friend, temporarily.<br /><br />Q: Why did that make him our friend?<br />A: Because at that time, Iran was our enemy.<br /><br />Q: Isn't that when he gassed the Kurds?<br />A: Yeah, but since he was fighting against Iran at the time, we looked the other way, to show him we were his friend.<br /><br />Q: So anyone who fights against one of our enemies automatically becomes our friend?<br />A: Most of the time, yes.<br /><br />Q: And anyone who fights against one of our friends is automatically an enemy?<br />A: Sometimes that's true, t! oo. However, if American corporations can profit by selling weapons to both sides at the same time, all  the better.<br /><br />Q: Why?<br />A: Because war is good for the economy, which meanswar is good for America. Also, since God is on America's side, anyone who opposes war is  a godless un-American Communist. Do you understand now why we attacked Iraq?<br /><br />Q: I think so. We attacked them because God wanted us to,r ight?<br />A: Yes.<br /><br />Q: But how did we know God wanted us to attack Iraq?<br />A: Well, you see, God personally speaks to George W. Bush and tells him what to do.<br /><br />Q: So basically, what you're saying is that we attacked Iraq because George W. Bush hears voices in his head?<br />A. Yes! You finally understand how the world works. Now close your eyes, make yourself comfortable, and go to sleep. Good night.<br /><br />Good night, Daddy.<br /></div></div>]]></body></post><post id="p13617" date="Posted: Sun Sep 28, 2003 6:00 am "><author>[sic]</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">That's great _shank.

It is Very difficult to positively identify the surface by just looking at it. So, how do we determine with any amount of certainty what type of mirror we are looking at? 
<br /><br />CONDUCT THIS SIMPLE TEST: Place the tip of your fingernail against the reflective surface and if there is a GAP between your fingernail and the image of the nail, then it is a GENUINE mirror. However, if your fingernail DIRECTLY TOUCHES the image of your nail, then BEWARE, IT IS A 2-WAY MIRROR! (there is someone seeing you from the other side).  The reason there is a gap on a real mirror, is because the silver is on the back of the mirror UNDER the glass. Whereas with a two-way mirror, the silver is on the surface. Keep it in mind! Make sure and check every time you enter in hotel rooms. May be someone is making a film on you.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p15645" date="Posted: Fri Nov 21, 2003 8:01 am "><author>Rayne</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">So basically, what you're saying is that we attacked Iraq because George W.

  <div class="quotecontent">The lizard brain<br /><br />Maybe you remember way back in school when you learned that the human brain still contains a prehistoric lizard brain at its center. This is the key to understanding women and what you can expect from them.<br /><br />Women still have direct contact with the lizard brain, something which men have been able to shut down about a trillion centuries ago.<br /><br />Have you ever noticed how women get cold very easily even if the temperature is only 1 µC below optimum? That's because lizards are cold-blooded, and a woman's lizard brain is telling her that she better get to a warm place quickly or her muscles will freeze up and her heart will stop beating.<br /><br />Have you noticed how a woman always seems to be thinking about two things at once? That's because a lizard's eyes point in two different directions, so it always has to process two completely different scenes.<br /><br />Have you noticed how two women can hate each other and have a serious fight, even if they don't know each other and they are sitting on opposite sides of the room? Lizards are very territorial and fight with each other by standing in one place and making threatening movements.<br /><br />Have you ever noticed how a woman drives? It's that two-direction eye problem again. That's why she thinks that it's possible to drive at high speed on a roundabout while looking in the mirror and adjusting her make-up.<br /><br />Have you noticed how a woman can sit somewhere completely happy, then suddenly out of nowhere she begins to cut you to pieces with her tongue? Well, just watch a lizard catch flies and you will know where that comes from.<br /><br />Women can lay in the sun on a big rock all day and never get bored.<br /><br />If a woman gets the chance, and she thinks that she can get away with it, she will color her hair orange and green and get it styled into a spiky hairdo. This is definitely a lizard haircut.<br /><br />I'm sure that there are hundreds of examples. The point is, the lizard brain theory explains everything. I am expecting to win the Nobel Prize this year.</div>

Invasions always work better than  inspections.<br /><br />Q: But after we invaded them, we STILL didn't find any weapons  of mass destruction, did we?<br />A: That's because the weapons are so well hidden.

If they had all those weapons that they planned to use in a war, then why didn't they use any of those weapons when we  went to war with them?<br />A: Well, obviously they didn't want anyone to know they had  those weapons,so they chose to die by the thousands rather than defend themselves.<br /><br />Q: That doesn't make sense Daddy.

What does a cruel dictator do that makes it OK to invade his country?<br />A: Well, for one thing, he tortured his own people.<br /><br />Q: Kind of like what they do in China?<br />A: Don't go comparing China to Iraq. China is a good economic competitor, where millions of people work for slave wages in sweatshops to make U.S. corporations richer.<br /><br />Q: So if a country lets its people be exploited for American corporate<br />gain, it's a good country, even if that country tortures people?<br />A: Right.<br /><br />Q: Why were people in Iraq being tortured?<br />A: For political crimes, mostly, like criticizing the  government. People who criticized the government in Iraq were sent to prison and tortured.<br /><br />Q: Isn't that exactly what happens in China?<br />A: I told you, China is different.<br /><br />Q: What's the difference between China and Iraq?<br />A: Well, for one thing, Iraq was ruled by the Ba'ath party, while China is Communist.<br /><br />Q: Didn't you once tell me Communists were bad?<br />A: No, just Cuban Communists are bad.<br /><br />Q: How are the Cuban Communists bad?<br />A: Well, for one thing, people who criticize the government in Cuba are sent to prison and tortured.<br /><br />Q: Like in Iraq?<br />A: Exactly.<br /><br />Q: And like in China, too?<br />A: I told you, China's a good economic competitor. Cuba, on the other hand, is not.<br /><br />Q: How come Cuba isn't a good economic competitor?<br />A: Well, you see, back in the early 1960s, our government passed some laws that made it illegal for Americans to trade or do any business with Cuba until they stopped being Communists and started being capitalists like us.<br /><br />Q: But if we got rid of those laws, opened up trade with Cuba,and started doing business with them, wouldn't that help the Cubans become capitalists?<br />A: Don't be a smart-ass.<br /><br />Q: I didn't think I was being one.<br />A: Well, anyway, they also don't have freedom of religion in Cuba.<br /><br />Q: Kind of like China and the @!#$ movement?<br />A: I told you, stop saying bad things about China. Anyway,  Saddam Hussein came to power through a military coup, so he's not really a legitimate leader anyway.<br /><br />Q: What's a military coup?<br />A: That's when a military general takes over the government of a country by force, instead of holding free elections like we do in the United States.<br /><br />Q: Didn't the ruler of Pakistan come to power by a military coup?<br />A: You mean General Pervez Musharraf? Uh, yeah, he did, but Pakistan is our friend.<br /><br />Q: Why is Pakistan our friend if their leader is illegitimate?<br />A: I never said Pervez Musharraf was illegitimate.<br /><br />Q: Didn't you just say a military general who comes to power by forcibly overthrowing the legitimate government of a nation is an illegitimate leader?<br />A: Only Saddam Hussein. Pervez Musharraf is our friend, because he helped us invade Afghanistan.<br /><br />Q: Why did we invade Afghanistan?<br />A: Because of what they did to us on September 11th.<br /><br />Q: What did Afghanistan do to us on September 11th?<br />A: Well, on September 11th, nineteen men, fifteen of them Saudi Arabians, hijacked four airplanes and flew three of them into buildings,killing over 3,000 Americans.<br /><br />Q: So how did Afghanistan figure into all that?<br />A: Afghanistan was where those bad men trained, under the oppressive rule of the Taliban.<br /><br />Q: Aren't the Taliban those bad radical Islamics who chopped off people's heads and hands?<br />A: Yes, that's exactly who they were. Not only did they chop off people's heads and hands, but they oppressed women, too.<br /><br />Q: Didn't the Bush administration giv e the Taliban 43 million dollars back in May of 2001?<br />A: Yes, but that money was a reward because they did such a good job fighting drugs.<br /><br />Q: Fighting drugs?<br />A: Yes, the Taliban were very helpful in stopping people from growing opium poppies.<br /><br />Q: How did they do such a good job?<br />A: Simple. If people were caught growing opium poppies, the Taliban would have their hands and heads cut off.<br /><br />Q: So, when the Taliban cut off people's heads and hands for growing flowers, that was OK, but not if they cut people's heads and hands off for other reasons?<br />A: Yes. It's OK with us if radical Islamic fundamentalists cut off people's hands for growing flowers, but it's cruel if they cut off people's hands for stealing bread.<br /><br />Q: Don't they also cut off people's hands and heads in Saudi Arabia?<br />A: That's different. Afghanistan was ruled by a tyrannical patriarchy that oppressed women and forced them to wear burqas whenever they  were in public, with death by stoning as the penalty for women who did not comply.<br /><br />Q: Don't Saudi women have to wear burqas in public,  too?<br />A: No, Saudi women merely wear a traditional Islamic body overing.<br /><br />Q: What's the difference?<br />A: The traditional Islamic co! vering worn by Saudi women is a modest yet fashionable garment that covers all of a woman's body xcept for her eyes and fingers. The burqa, on the other hand, is an evil tool of patriarchal oppression that covers all of a woman's body except for her eyes<br />and fingers.<br /><br />Q: It sounds like the same thing with a different  name.<br />A: Now, don't go comparing Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia. The Saudis are our friends.<br /><br />Q: But I thought you said 15 of the 19 hijackers on September 11th were from Saudi Arabia.<br />A: Yes, but they trained in Afghanistan.<br /><br />Q: Who trained them?<br />A: A very bad man named Osama bin Laden.<br /><br />Q: Was he from Afghanist! an?<br />A: Uh, no, he was from Saudi Arabia too. But he was a bad man, a very bad man.<br /><br />Q: I seem to recall he was our friend once.<br />A: Only when we helped him and the mujahadeen repel the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan back in the 1980s.<br /><br />Q: Who are the Soviets? Was that the Evil Communist Empire  Ronald Reagan talked about?<br />A: There are no more Soviets. The Soviet Union broke up in 1990 or there abouts, and now they have elections and capitalism like us. We call them Russians now.<br /><br />Q: So the Soviets, I mean, the Russians, are now our  friends?<br />A: Well, not really. You see, they were our friends for many years after they stopped being Soviets, bu t then they decided not to support our invasion of Iraq, so we're mad at them now. We're also mad at  the French and the Germans because they didn't help us invade Iraqe ither.<br /><br />Q: So the French and Germans are evil, too?<br />A: Not exactly evil, but just bad enough that we had to rename French fries and French toast to Freedom Fries and Freedom Toast.<br /><br />Q: Do we always rename foods whenever another country doesn't do what we want them to do?<br />A: No, we just do that to our friends. Our enemies, we  invade.<br /><br />Q: But wasn't Iraq one of our friends back in the  1980s?<br />A: Well, yeah. For a while.<br /><br />Q: Was Saddam Hussein ruler of Iraq back then?<br />A: Yes, but at the time he was fighting against Iran, which made him our friend, temporarily.<br /><br />Q: Why did that make him our friend?<br />A: Because at that time, Iran was our enemy.<br /><br />Q: Isn't that when he gassed the Kurds?<br />A: Yeah, but since he was fighting against Iran at the time, we looked the other way, to show him we were his friend.<br /><br />Q: So anyone who fights against one of our enemies automatically becomes our friend?<br />A: Most of the time, yes.<br /><br />Q: And anyone who fights against one of our friends is automatically an enemy?<br />A: Sometimes that's true, t! oo. However, if American corporations can profit by selling weapons to both sides at the same time, all  the better.<br /><br />Q: Why?<br />A: Because war is good for the economy, which meanswar is good for America. Also, since God is on America's side, anyone who opposes war is  a godless un-American Communist. Do you understand now why we attacked Iraq?<br /><br />Q: I think so. We attacked them because God wanted us to,r ight?<br />A: Yes.<br /><br />Q: But how did we know God wanted us to attack Iraq?<br />A: Well, you see, God personally speaks to George W. Bush and tells him what to do.<br /><br />Q: So basically, what you're saying is that we attacked Iraq because George W. Bush hears voices in his head?<br />A. Yes! You finally understand how the world works. Now close your eyes, make yourself comfortable, and go to sleep. Good night.<br /><br />Good night, Daddy.<br /></div></div>]]></body></post><post id="p13617" date="Posted: Sun Sep 28, 2003 6:00 am "><author>[sic]</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">That's great _shank.

It is Very difficult to positively identify the surface by just looking at it. So, how do we determine with any amount of certainty what type of mirror we are looking at? 
<br /><br />CONDUCT THIS SIMPLE TEST: Place the tip of your fingernail against the reflective surface and if there is a GAP between your fingernail and the image of the nail, then it is a GENUINE mirror. However, if your fingernail DIRECTLY TOUCHES the image of your nail, then BEWARE, IT IS A 2-WAY MIRROR! (there is someone seeing you from the other side).  The reason there is a gap on a real mirror, is because the silver is on the back of the mirror UNDER the glass. Whereas with a two-way mirror, the silver is on the surface. Keep it in mind! Make sure and check every time you enter in hotel rooms. May be someone is making a film on you.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p15645" date="Posted: Fri Nov 21, 2003 8:01 am "><author>Rayne</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">So basically, what you're saying is that we attacked Iraq because George W.

  <div class="quotecontent">The lizard brain<br /><br />Maybe you remember way back in school when you learned that the human brain still contains a prehistoric lizard brain at its center. This is the key to understanding women and what you can expect from them.<br /><br />Women still have direct contact with the lizard brain, something which men have been able to shut down about a trillion centuries ago.<br /><br />Have you ever noticed how women get cold very easily even if the temperature is only 1 µC below optimum? That's because lizards are cold-blooded, and a woman's lizard brain is telling her that she better get to a warm place quickly or her muscles will freeze up and her heart will stop beating.<br /><br />Have you noticed how a woman always seems to be thinking about two things at once? That's because a lizard's eyes point in two different directions, so it always has to process two completely different scenes.<br /><br />Have you noticed how two women can hate each other and have a serious fight, even if they don't know each other and they are sitting on opposite sides of the room? Lizards are very territorial and fight with each other by standing in one place and making threatening movements.<br /><br />Have you ever noticed how a woman drives? It's that two-direction eye problem again. That's why she thinks that it's possible to drive at high speed on a roundabout while looking in the mirror and adjusting her make-up.<br /><br />Have you noticed how a woman can sit somewhere completely happy, then suddenly out of nowhere she begins to cut you to pieces with her tongue? Well, just watch a lizard catch flies and you will know where that comes from.<br /><br />Women can lay in the sun on a big rock all day and never get bored.<br /><br />If a woman gets the chance, and she thinks that she can get away with it, she will color her hair orange and green and get it styled into a spiky hairdo. This is definitely a lizard haircut.<br /><br />I'm sure that there are hundreds of examples. The point is, the lizard brain theory explains everything. I am expecting to win the Nobel Prize this year.</div>

<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Hey,<br />This is a conversation between a father and a son...you will probably understand the reason why US attacked Iraq and how the world functions better after reading<br />this.<br /><br />Q: Daddy, why did we have to attack Iraq?<br />A: Because they had weapons of mass destruction,  honey.<br /><br />Q: But the inspectors didn't find any weapons of mass destruction.<br />A: That's because the Iraqis were hiding them.<br /><br />Q: And that's why we invaded Iraq?<br />A: Yep. Invasions always work better than  inspections.<br /><br />Q: But after we invaded them, we STILL didn't find any weapons  of mass destruction, did we?<br />A: That's because the weapons are so well hidden. Don't worry, we'll find something, probably right before the 2004 election.<br /><br />Q: Why did Iraq want all those weapons of mass  destruction?<br />A: To use them in a war, silly.<br /><br />Q: I'm confused. If they had all those weapons that they planned to use in a war, then why didn't they use any of those weapons when we  went to war with them?<br />A: Well, obviously they didn't want anyone to know they had  those weapons,so they chose to die by the thousands rather than defend themselves.<br /><br />Q: That doesn't make sense Daddy. Why would they choose to die  if they had all those big weapons to fight us back with?<br />A: It's a different culture. It's not supposed to make  sense.<br /><br />Q: I don't know about you, but I don't think they had any of those weapons our government said they did.<br />A: Well, you know, it doesn't matter whether or not they had those weapons. We had another good reason to invade them anyway.<br /><br />Q: And what was that?<br />A: Even if Iraq didn't have weapons of mass destruction, Saddam Hussein was a cruel dictator, which is another good reason to invade another country.<br /><br />Q: Why? What does a cruel dictator do that makes it OK to invade his country?<br />A: Well, for one thing, he tortured his own people.<br /><br />Q: Kind of like what they do in China?<br />A: Don't go comparing China to Iraq. China is a good economic competitor, where millions of people work for slave wages in sweatshops to make U.S. corporations richer.<br /><br />Q: So if a country lets its people be exploited for American corporate<br />gain, it's a good country, even if that country tortures people?<br />A: Right.<br /><br />Q: Why were people in Iraq being tortured?<br />A: For political crimes, mostly, like criticizing the  government. People who criticized the government in Iraq were sent to prison and tortured.<br /><br />Q: Isn't that exactly what happens in China?<br />A: I told you, China is different.<br /><br />Q: What's the difference between China and Iraq?<br />A: Well, for one thing, Iraq was ruled by the Ba'ath party, while China is Communist.<br /><br />Q: Didn't you once tell me Communists were bad?<br />A: No, just Cuban Communists are bad.<br /><br />Q: How are the Cuban Communists bad?<br />A: Well, for one thing, people who criticize the government in Cuba are sent to prison and tortured.<br /><br />Q: Like in Iraq?<br />A: Exactly.<br /><br />Q: And like in China, too?<br />A: I told you, China's a good economic competitor. Cuba, on the other hand, is not.<br /><br />Q: How come Cuba isn't a good economic competitor?<br />A: Well, you see, back in the early 1960s, our government passed some laws that made it illegal for Americans to trade or do any business with Cuba until they stopped being Communists and started being capitalists like us.<br /><br />Q: But if we got rid of those laws, opened up trade with Cuba,and started doing business with them, wouldn't that help the Cubans become capitalists?<br />A: Don't be a smart-ass.<br /><br />Q: I didn't think I was being one.<br />A: Well, anyway, they also don't have freedom of religion in Cuba.<br /><br />Q: Kind of like China and the @!#$ movement?<br />A: I told you, stop saying bad things about China. Anyway,  Saddam Hussein came to power through a military coup, so he's not really a legitimate leader anyway.<br /><br />Q: What's a military coup?<br />A: That's when a military general takes over the government of a country by force, instead of holding free elections like we do in the United States.<br /><br />Q: Didn't the ruler of Pakistan come to power by a military coup?<br />A: You mean General Pervez Musharraf? Uh, yeah, he did, but Pakistan is our friend.<br /><br />Q: Why is Pakistan our friend if their leader is illegitimate?<br />A: I never said Pervez Musharraf was illegitimate.<br /><br />Q: Didn't you just say a military general who comes to power by forcibly overthrowing the legitimate government of a nation is an illegitimate leader?<br />A: Only Saddam Hussein. Pervez Musharraf is our friend, because he helped us invade Afghanistan.<br /><br />Q: Why did we invade Afghanistan?<br />A: Because of what they did to us on September 11th.<br /><br />Q: What did Afghanistan do to us on September 11th?<br />A: Well, on September 11th, nineteen men, fifteen of them Saudi Arabians, hijacked four airplanes and flew three of them into buildings,killing over 3,000 Americans.<br /><br />Q: So how did Afghanistan figure into all that?<br />A: Afghanistan was where those bad men trained, under the oppressive rule of the Taliban.<br /><br />Q: Aren't the Taliban those bad radical Islamics who chopped off people's heads and hands?<br />A: Yes, that's exactly who they were. Not only did they chop off people's heads and hands, but they oppressed women, too.<br /><br />Q: Didn't the Bush administration giv e the Taliban 43 million dollars back in May of 2001?<br />A: Yes, but that money was a reward because they did such a good job fighting drugs.<br /><br />Q: Fighting drugs?<br />A: Yes, the Taliban were very helpful in stopping people from growing opium poppies.<br /><br />Q: How did they do such a good job?<br />A: Simple. If people were caught growing opium poppies, the Taliban would have their hands and heads cut off.<br /><br />Q: So, when the Taliban cut off people's heads and hands for growing flowers, that was OK, but not if they cut people's heads and hands off for other reasons?<br />A: Yes. It's OK with us if radical Islamic fundamentalists cut off people's hands for growing flowers, but it's cruel if they cut off people's hands for stealing bread.<br /><br />Q: Don't they also cut off people's hands and heads in Saudi Arabia?<br />A: That's different. Afghanistan was ruled by a tyrannical patriarchy that oppressed women and forced them to wear burqas whenever they  were in public, with death by stoning as the penalty for women who did not comply.<br /><br />Q: Don't Saudi women have to wear burqas in public,  too?<br />A: No, Saudi women merely wear a traditional Islamic body overing.<br /><br />Q: What's the difference?<br />A: The traditional Islamic co! vering worn by Saudi women is a modest yet fashionable garment that covers all of a woman's body xcept for her eyes and fingers. The burqa, on the other hand, is an evil tool of patriarchal oppression that covers all of a woman's body except for her eyes<br />and fingers.<br /><br />Q: It sounds like the same thing with a different  name.<br />A: Now, don't go comparing Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia. The Saudis are our friends.<br /><br />Q: But I thought you said 15 of the 19 hijackers on September 11th were from Saudi Arabia.<br />A: Yes, but they trained in Afghanistan.<br /><br />Q: Who trained them?<br />A: A very bad man named Osama bin Laden.<br /><br />Q: Was he from Afghanist! an?<br />A: Uh, no, he was from Saudi Arabia too. But he was a bad man, a very bad man.<br /><br />Q: I seem to recall he was our friend once.<br />A: Only when we helped him and the mujahadeen repel the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan back in the 1980s.<br /><br />Q: Who are the Soviets? Was that the Evil Communist Empire  Ronald Reagan talked about?<br />A: There are no more Soviets. The Soviet Union broke up in 1990 or there abouts, and now they have elections and capitalism like us. We call them Russians now.<br /><br />Q: So the Soviets, I mean, the Russians, are now our  friends?<br />A: Well, not really. You see, they were our friends for many years after they stopped being Soviets, bu t then they decided not to support our invasion of Iraq, so we're mad at them now. We're also mad at  the French and the Germans because they didn't help us invade Iraqe ither.<br /><br />Q: So the French and Germans are evil, too?<br />A: Not exactly evil, but just bad enough that we had to rename French fries and French toast to Freedom Fries and Freedom Toast.<br /><br />Q: Do we always rename foods whenever another country doesn't do what we want them to do?<br />A: No, we just do that to our friends. Our enemies, we  invade.<br /><br />Q: But wasn't Iraq one of our friends back in the  1980s?<br />A: Well, yeah. For a while.<br /><br />Q: Was Saddam Hussein ruler of Iraq back then?<br />A: Yes, but at the time he was fighting against Iran, which made him our friend, temporarily.<br /><br />Q: Why did that make him our friend?<br />A: Because at that time, Iran was our enemy.<br /><br />Q: Isn't that when he gassed the Kurds?<br />A: Yeah, but since he was fighting against Iran at the time, we looked the other way, to show him we were his friend.<br /><br />Q: So anyone who fights against one of our enemies automatically becomes our friend?<br />A: Most of the time, yes.<br /><br />Q: And anyone who fights against one of our friends is automatically an enemy?<br />A: Sometimes that's true, t! oo. However, if American corporations can profit by selling weapons to both sides at the same time, all  the better.<br /><br />Q: Why?<br />A: Because war is good for the economy, which meanswar is good for America. Also, since God is on America's side, anyone who opposes war is  a godless un-American Communist. Do you understand now why we attacked Iraq?<br /><br />Q: I think so. We attacked them because God wanted us to,r ight?<br />A: Yes.<br /><br />Q: But how did we know God wanted us to attack Iraq?<br />A: Well, you see, God personally speaks to George W. Bush and tells him what to do.<br /><br />Q: So basically, what you're saying is that we attacked Iraq because George W. Bush hears voices in his head?<br />A. Yes! You finally understand how the world works. Now close your eyes, make yourself comfortable, and go to sleep. Good night.<br /><br />Good night, Daddy.<br /></div></div>]]></body></post><post id="p13617" date="Posted: Sun Sep 28, 2003 6:00 am "><author>[sic]</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">That's great _shank.

It is Very difficult to positively identify the surface by just looking at it. So, how do we determine with any amount of certainty what type of mirror we are looking at? 
<br /><br />CONDUCT THIS SIMPLE TEST: Place the tip of your fingernail against the reflective surface and if there is a GAP between your fingernail and the image of the nail, then it is a GENUINE mirror. However, if your fingernail DIRECTLY TOUCHES the image of your nail, then BEWARE, IT IS A 2-WAY MIRROR! (there is someone seeing you from the other side).  The reason there is a gap on a real mirror, is because the silver is on the back of the mirror UNDER the glass. Whereas with a two-way mirror, the silver is on the surface. Keep it in mind! Make sure and check every time you enter in hotel rooms. May be someone is making a film on you.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p15645" date="Posted: Fri Nov 21, 2003 8:01 am "><author>Rayne</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">So basically, what you're saying is that we attacked Iraq because George W.

  <div class="quotecontent">The lizard brain<br /><br />Maybe you remember way back in school when you learned that the human brain still contains a prehistoric lizard brain at its center. This is the key to understanding women and what you can expect from them.<br /><br />Women still have direct contact with the lizard brain, something which men have been able to shut down about a trillion centuries ago.<br /><br />Have you ever noticed how women get cold very easily even if the temperature is only 1 µC below optimum? That's because lizards are cold-blooded, and a woman's lizard brain is telling her that she better get to a warm place quickly or her muscles will freeze up and her heart will stop beating.<br /><br />Have you noticed how a woman always seems to be thinking about two things at once? That's because a lizard's eyes point in two different directions, so it always has to process two completely different scenes.<br /><br />Have you noticed how two women can hate each other and have a serious fight, even if they don't know each other and they are sitting on opposite sides of the room? Lizards are very territorial and fight with each other by standing in one place and making threatening movements.<br /><br />Have you ever noticed how a woman drives? It's that two-direction eye problem again. That's why she thinks that it's possible to drive at high speed on a roundabout while looking in the mirror and adjusting her make-up.<br /><br />Have you noticed how a woman can sit somewhere completely happy, then suddenly out of nowhere she begins to cut you to pieces with her tongue? Well, just watch a lizard catch flies and you will know where that comes from.<br /><br />Women can lay in the sun on a big rock all day and never get bored.<br /><br />If a woman gets the chance, and she thinks that she can get away with it, she will color her hair orange and green and get it styled into a spiky hairdo. This is definitely a lizard haircut.<br /><br />I'm sure that there are hundreds of examples. The point is, the lizard brain theory explains everything. I am expecting to win the Nobel Prize this year.</div>

<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Hey,<br />This is a conversation between a father and a son...you will probably understand the reason why US attacked Iraq and how the world functions better after reading<br />this.<br /><br />Q: Daddy, why did we have to attack Iraq?<br />A: Because they had weapons of mass destruction,  honey.<br /><br />Q: But the inspectors didn't find any weapons of mass destruction.<br />A: That's because the Iraqis were hiding them.<br /><br />Q: And that's why we invaded Iraq?<br />A: Yep. Invasions always work better than  inspections.<br /><br />Q: But after we invaded them, we STILL didn't find any weapons  of mass destruction, did we?<br />A: That's because the weapons are so well hidden. Don't worry, we'll find something, probably right before the 2004 election.<br /><br />Q: Why did Iraq want all those weapons of mass  destruction?<br />A: To use them in a war, silly.<br /><br />Q: I'm confused. If they had all those weapons that they planned to use in a war, then why didn't they use any of those weapons when we  went to war with them?<br />A: Well, obviously they didn't want anyone to know they had  those weapons,so they chose to die by the thousands rather than defend themselves.<br /><br />Q: That doesn't make sense Daddy. Why would they choose to die  if they had all those big weapons to fight us back with?<br />A: It's a different culture. It's not supposed to make  sense.<br /><br />Q: I don't know about you, but I don't think they had any of those weapons our government said they did.<br />A: Well, you know, it doesn't matter whether or not they had those weapons. We had another good reason to invade them anyway.<br /><br />Q: And what was that?<br />A: Even if Iraq didn't have weapons of mass destruction, Saddam Hussein was a cruel dictator, which is another good reason to invade another country.<br /><br />Q: Why? What does a cruel dictator do that makes it OK to invade his country?<br />A: Well, for one thing, he tortured his own people.<br /><br />Q: Kind of like what they do in China?<br />A: Don't go comparing China to Iraq. China is a good economic competitor, where millions of people work for slave wages in sweatshops to make U.S. corporations richer.<br /><br />Q: So if a country lets its people be exploited for American corporate<br />gain, it's a good country, even if that country tortures people?<br />A: Right.<br /><br />Q: Why were people in Iraq being tortured?<br />A: For political crimes, mostly, like criticizing the  government. People who criticized the government in Iraq were sent to prison and tortured.<br /><br />Q: Isn't that exactly what happens in China?<br />A: I told you, China is different.<br /><br />Q: What's the difference between China and Iraq?<br />A: Well, for one thing, Iraq was ruled by the Ba'ath party, while China is Communist.<br /><br />Q: Didn't you once tell me Communists were bad?<br />A: No, just Cuban Communists are bad.<br /><br />Q: How are the Cuban Communists bad?<br />A: Well, for one thing, people who criticize the government in Cuba are sent to prison and tortured.<br /><br />Q: Like in Iraq?<br />A: Exactly.<br /><br />Q: And like in China, too?<br />A: I told you, China's a good economic competitor. Cuba, on the other hand, is not.<br /><br />Q: How come Cuba isn't a good economic competitor?<br />A: Well, you see, back in the early 1960s, our government passed some laws that made it illegal for Americans to trade or do any business with Cuba until they stopped being Communists and started being capitalists like us.<br /><br />Q: But if we got rid of those laws, opened up trade with Cuba,and started doing business with them, wouldn't that help the Cubans become capitalists?<br />A: Don't be a smart-ass.<br /><br />Q: I didn't think I was being one.<br />A: Well, anyway, they also don't have freedom of religion in Cuba.<br /><br />Q: Kind of like China and the @!#$ movement?<br />A: I told you, stop saying bad things about China. Anyway,  Saddam Hussein came to power through a military coup, so he's not really a legitimate leader anyway.<br /><br />Q: What's a military coup?<br />A: That's when a military general takes over the government of a country by force, instead of holding free elections like we do in the United States.<br /><br />Q: Didn't the ruler of Pakistan come to power by a military coup?<br />A: You mean General Pervez Musharraf? Uh, yeah, he did, but Pakistan is our friend.<br /><br />Q: Why is Pakistan our friend if their leader is illegitimate?<br />A: I never said Pervez Musharraf was illegitimate.<br /><br />Q: Didn't you just say a military general who comes to power by forcibly overthrowing the legitimate government of a nation is an illegitimate leader?<br />A: Only Saddam Hussein. Pervez Musharraf is our friend, because he helped us invade Afghanistan.<br /><br />Q: Why did we invade Afghanistan?<br />A: Because of what they did to us on September 11th.<br /><br />Q: What did Afghanistan do to us on September 11th?<br />A: Well, on September 11th, nineteen men, fifteen of them Saudi Arabians, hijacked four airplanes and flew three of them into buildings,killing over 3,000 Americans.<br /><br />Q: So how did Afghanistan figure into all that?<br />A: Afghanistan was where those bad men trained, under the oppressive rule of the Taliban.<br /><br />Q: Aren't the Taliban those bad radical Islamics who chopped off people's heads and hands?<br />A: Yes, that's exactly who they were. Not only did they chop off people's heads and hands, but they oppressed women, too.<br /><br />Q: Didn't the Bush administration giv e the Taliban 43 million dollars back in May of 2001?<br />A: Yes, but that money was a reward because they did such a good job fighting drugs.<br /><br />Q: Fighting drugs?<br />A: Yes, the Taliban were very helpful in stopping people from growing opium poppies.<br /><br />Q: How did they do such a good job?<br />A: Simple. If people were caught growing opium poppies, the Taliban would have their hands and heads cut off.<br /><br />Q: So, when the Taliban cut off people's heads and hands for growing flowers, that was OK, but not if they cut people's heads and hands off for other reasons?<br />A: Yes. It's OK with us if radical Islamic fundamentalists cut off people's hands for growing flowers, but it's cruel if they cut off people's hands for stealing bread.<br /><br />Q: Don't they also cut off people's hands and heads in Saudi Arabia?<br />A: That's different. Afghanistan was ruled by a tyrannical patriarchy that oppressed women and forced them to wear burqas whenever they  were in public, with death by stoning as the penalty for women who did not comply.<br /><br />Q: Don't Saudi women have to wear burqas in public,  too?<br />A: No, Saudi women merely wear a traditional Islamic body overing.<br /><br />Q: What's the difference?<br />A: The traditional Islamic co! vering worn by Saudi women is a modest yet fashionable garment that covers all of a woman's body xcept for her eyes and fingers. The burqa, on the other hand, is an evil tool of patriarchal oppression that covers all of a woman's body except for her eyes<br />and fingers.<br /><br />Q: It sounds like the same thing with a different  name.<br />A: Now, don't go comparing Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia. The Saudis are our friends.<br /><br />Q: But I thought you said 15 of the 19 hijackers on September 11th were from Saudi Arabia.<br />A: Yes, but they trained in Afghanistan.<br /><br />Q: Who trained them?<br />A: A very bad man named Osama bin Laden.<br /><br />Q: Was he from Afghanist! an?<br />A: Uh, no, he was from Saudi Arabia too. But he was a bad man, a very bad man.<br /><br />Q: I seem to recall he was our friend once.<br />A: Only when we helped him and the mujahadeen repel the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan back in the 1980s.<br /><br />Q: Who are the Soviets? Was that the Evil Communist Empire  Ronald Reagan talked about?<br />A: There are no more Soviets. The Soviet Union broke up in 1990 or there abouts, and now they have elections and capitalism like us. We call them Russians now.<br /><br />Q: So the Soviets, I mean, the Russians, are now our  friends?<br />A: Well, not really. You see, they were our friends for many years after they stopped being Soviets, bu t then they decided not to support our invasion of Iraq, so we're mad at them now. We're also mad at  the French and the Germans because they didn't help us invade Iraqe ither.<br /><br />Q: So the French and Germans are evil, too?<br />A: Not exactly evil, but just bad enough that we had to rename French fries and French toast to Freedom Fries and Freedom Toast.<br /><br />Q: Do we always rename foods whenever another country doesn't do what we want them to do?<br />A: No, we just do that to our friends. Our enemies, we  invade.<br /><br />Q: But wasn't Iraq one of our friends back in the  1980s?<br />A: Well, yeah. For a while.<br /><br />Q: Was Saddam Hussein ruler of Iraq back then?<br />A: Yes, but at the time he was fighting against Iran, which made him our friend, temporarily.<br /><br />Q: Why did that make him our friend?<br />A: Because at that time, Iran was our enemy.<br /><br />Q: Isn't that when he gassed the Kurds?<br />A: Yeah, but since he was fighting against Iran at the time, we looked the other way, to show him we were his friend.<br /><br />Q: So anyone who fights against one of our enemies automatically becomes our friend?<br />A: Most of the time, yes.<br /><br />Q: And anyone who fights against one of our friends is automatically an enemy?<br />A: Sometimes that's true, t! oo. However, if American corporations can profit by selling weapons to both sides at the same time, all  the better.<br /><br />Q: Why?<br />A: Because war is good for the economy, which meanswar is good for America. Also, since God is on America's side, anyone who opposes war is  a godless un-American Communist. Do you understand now why we attacked Iraq?<br /><br />Q: I think so. We attacked them because God wanted us to,r ight?<br />A: Yes.<br /><br />Q: But how did we know God wanted us to attack Iraq?<br />A: Well, you see, God personally speaks to George W. Bush and tells him what to do.<br /><br />Q: So basically, what you're saying is that we attacked Iraq because George W. Bush hears voices in his head?<br />A. Yes! You finally understand how the world works. Now close your eyes, make yourself comfortable, and go to sleep. Good night.<br /><br />Good night, Daddy.<br /></div></div>]]></body></post><post id="p13617" date="Posted: Sun Sep 28, 2003 6:00 am "><author>[sic]</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">That's great _shank.

It is Very difficult to positively identify the surface by just looking at it. So, how do we determine with any amount of certainty what type of mirror we are looking at? 
<br /><br />CONDUCT THIS SIMPLE TEST: Place the tip of your fingernail against the reflective surface and if there is a GAP between your fingernail and the image of the nail, then it is a GENUINE mirror. However, if your fingernail DIRECTLY TOUCHES the image of your nail, then BEWARE, IT IS A 2-WAY MIRROR! (there is someone seeing you from the other side).  The reason there is a gap on a real mirror, is because the silver is on the back of the mirror UNDER the glass. Whereas with a two-way mirror, the silver is on the surface. Keep it in mind! Make sure and check every time you enter in hotel rooms. May be someone is making a film on you.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p15645" date="Posted: Fri Nov 21, 2003 8:01 am "><author>Rayne</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">So basically, what you're saying is that we attacked Iraq because George W.

  <div class="quotecontent">The lizard brain<br /><br />Maybe you remember way back in school when you learned that the human brain still contains a prehistoric lizard brain at its center. This is the key to understanding women and what you can expect from them.<br /><br />Women still have direct contact with the lizard brain, something which men have been able to shut down about a trillion centuries ago.<br /><br />Have you ever noticed how women get cold very easily even if the temperature is only 1 µC below optimum? That's because lizards are cold-blooded, and a woman's lizard brain is telling her that she better get to a warm place quickly or her muscles will freeze up and her heart will stop beating.<br /><br />Have you noticed how a woman always seems to be thinking about two things at once? That's because a lizard's eyes point in two different directions, so it always has to process two completely different scenes.<br /><br />Have you noticed how two women can hate each other and have a serious fight, even if they don't know each other and they are sitting on opposite sides of the room? Lizards are very territorial and fight with each other by standing in one place and making threatening movements.<br /><br />Have you ever noticed how a woman drives? It's that two-direction eye problem again. That's why she thinks that it's possible to drive at high speed on a roundabout while looking in the mirror and adjusting her make-up.<br /><br />Have you noticed how a woman can sit somewhere completely happy, then suddenly out of nowhere she begins to cut you to pieces with her tongue? Well, just watch a lizard catch flies and you will know where that comes from.<br /><br />Women can lay in the sun on a big rock all day and never get bored.<br /><br />If a woman gets the chance, and she thinks that she can get away with it, she will color her hair orange and green and get it styled into a spiky hairdo. This is definitely a lizard haircut.<br /><br />I'm sure that there are hundreds of examples. The point is, the lizard brain theory explains everything. I am expecting to win the Nobel Prize this year.</div>

<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Hey,<br />This is a conversation between a father and a son...you will probably understand the reason why US attacked Iraq and how the world functions better after reading<br />this.<br /><br />Q: Daddy, why did we have to attack Iraq?<br />A: Because they had weapons of mass destruction,  honey.<br /><br />Q: But the inspectors didn't find any weapons of mass destruction.<br />A: That's because the Iraqis were hiding them.<br /><br />Q: And that's why we invaded Iraq?<br />A: Yep. Invasions always work better than  inspections.<br /><br />Q: But after we invaded them, we STILL didn't find any weapons  of mass destruction, did we?<br />A: That's because the weapons are so well hidden. Don't worry, we'll find something, probably right before the 2004 election.<br /><br />Q: Why did Iraq want all those weapons of mass  destruction?<br />A: To use them in a war, silly.<br /><br />Q: I'm confused. If they had all those weapons that they planned to use in a war, then why didn't they use any of those weapons when we  went to war with them?<br />A: Well, obviously they didn't want anyone to know they had  those weapons,so they chose to die by the thousands rather than defend themselves.<br /><br />Q: That doesn't make sense Daddy. Why would they choose to die  if they had all those big weapons to fight us back with?<br />A: It's a different culture. It's not supposed to make  sense.<br /><br />Q: I don't know about you, but I don't think they had any of those weapons our government said they did.<br />A: Well, you know, it doesn't matter whether or not they had those weapons. We had another good reason to invade them anyway.<br /><br />Q: And what was that?<br />A: Even if Iraq didn't have weapons of mass destruction, Saddam Hussein was a cruel dictator, which is another good reason to invade another country.<br /><br />Q: Why? What does a cruel dictator do that makes it OK to invade his country?<br />A: Well, for one thing, he tortured his own people.<br /><br />Q: Kind of like what they do in China?<br />A: Don't go comparing China to Iraq. China is a good economic competitor, where millions of people work for slave wages in sweatshops to make U.S. corporations richer.<br /><br />Q: So if a country lets its people be exploited for American corporate<br />gain, it's a good country, even if that country tortures people?<br />A: Right.<br /><br />Q: Why were people in Iraq being tortured?<br />A: For political crimes, mostly, like criticizing the  government. People who criticized the government in Iraq were sent to prison and tortured.<br /><br />Q: Isn't that exactly what happens in China?<br />A: I told you, China is different.<br /><br />Q: What's the difference between China and Iraq?<br />A: Well, for one thing, Iraq was ruled by the Ba'ath party, while China is Communist.<br /><br />Q: Didn't you once tell me Communists were bad?<br />A: No, just Cuban Communists are bad.<br /><br />Q: How are the Cuban Communists bad?<br />A: Well, for one thing, people who criticize the government in Cuba are sent to prison and tortured.<br /><br />Q: Like in Iraq?<br />A: Exactly.<br /><br />Q: And like in China, too?<br />A: I told you, China's a good economic competitor. Cuba, on the other hand, is not.<br /><br />Q: How come Cuba isn't a good economic competitor?<br />A: Well, you see, back in the early 1960s, our government passed some laws that made it illegal for Americans to trade or do any business with Cuba until they stopped being Communists and started being capitalists like us.<br /><br />Q: But if we got rid of those laws, opened up trade with Cuba,and started doing business with them, wouldn't that help the Cubans become capitalists?<br />A: Don't be a smart-ass.<br /><br />Q: I didn't think I was being one.<br />A: Well, anyway, they also don't have freedom of religion in Cuba.<br /><br />Q: Kind of like China and the @!#$ movement?<br />A: I told you, stop saying bad things about China. Anyway,  Saddam Hussein came to power through a military coup, so he's not really a legitimate leader anyway.<br /><br />Q: What's a military coup?<br />A: That's when a military general takes over the government of a country by force, instead of holding free elections like we do in the United States.<br /><br />Q: Didn't the ruler of Pakistan come to power by a military coup?<br />A: You mean General Pervez Musharraf? Uh, yeah, he did, but Pakistan is our friend.<br /><br />Q: Why is Pakistan our friend if their leader is illegitimate?<br />A: I never said Pervez Musharraf was illegitimate.<br /><br />Q: Didn't you just say a military general who comes to power by forcibly overthrowing the legitimate government of a nation is an illegitimate leader?<br />A: Only Saddam Hussein. Pervez Musharraf is our friend, because he helped us invade Afghanistan.<br /><br />Q: Why did we invade Afghanistan?<br />A: Because of what they did to us on September 11th.<br /><br />Q: What did Afghanistan do to us on September 11th?<br />A: Well, on September 11th, nineteen men, fifteen of them Saudi Arabians, hijacked four airplanes and flew three of them into buildings,killing over 3,000 Americans.<br /><br />Q: So how did Afghanistan figure into all that?<br />A: Afghanistan was where those bad men trained, under the oppressive rule of the Taliban.<br /><br />Q: Aren't the Taliban those bad radical Islamics who chopped off people's heads and hands?<br />A: Yes, that's exactly who they were. Not only did they chop off people's heads and hands, but they oppressed women, too.<br /><br />Q: Didn't the Bush administration giv e the Taliban 43 million dollars back in May of 2001?<br />A: Yes, but that money was a reward because they did such a good job fighting drugs.<br /><br />Q: Fighting drugs?<br />A: Yes, the Taliban were very helpful in stopping people from growing opium poppies.<br /><br />Q: How did they do such a good job?<br />A: Simple. If people were caught growing opium poppies, the Taliban would have their hands and heads cut off.<br /><br />Q: So, when the Taliban cut off people's heads and hands for growing flowers, that was OK, but not if they cut people's heads and hands off for other reasons?<br />A: Yes. It's OK with us if radical Islamic fundamentalists cut off people's hands for growing flowers, but it's cruel if they cut off people's hands for stealing bread.<br /><br />Q: Don't they also cut off people's hands and heads in Saudi Arabia?<br />A: That's different. Afghanistan was ruled by a tyrannical patriarchy that oppressed women and forced them to wear burqas whenever they  were in public, with death by stoning as the penalty for women who did not comply.<br /><br />Q: Don't Saudi women have to wear burqas in public,  too?<br />A: No, Saudi women merely wear a traditional Islamic body overing.<br /><br />Q: What's the difference?<br />A: The traditional Islamic co! vering worn by Saudi women is a modest yet fashionable garment that covers all of a woman's body xcept for her eyes and fingers. The burqa, on the other hand, is an evil tool of patriarchal oppression that covers all of a woman's body except for her eyes<br />and fingers.<br /><br />Q: It sounds like the same thing with a different  name.<br />A: Now, don't go comparing Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia. The Saudis are our friends.<br /><br />Q: But I thought you said 15 of the 19 hijackers on September 11th were from Saudi Arabia.<br />A: Yes, but they trained in Afghanistan.<br /><br />Q: Who trained them?<br />A: A very bad man named Osama bin Laden.<br /><br />Q: Was he from Afghanist! an?<br />A: Uh, no, he was from Saudi Arabia too. But he was a bad man, a very bad man.<br /><br />Q: I seem to recall he was our friend once.<br />A: Only when we helped him and the mujahadeen repel the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan back in the 1980s.<br /><br />Q: Who are the Soviets? Was that the Evil Communist Empire  Ronald Reagan talked about?<br />A: There are no more Soviets. The Soviet Union broke up in 1990 or there abouts, and now they have elections and capitalism like us. We call them Russians now.<br /><br />Q: So the Soviets, I mean, the Russians, are now our  friends?<br />A: Well, not really. You see, they were our friends for many years after they stopped being Soviets, bu t then they decided not to support our invasion of Iraq, so we're mad at them now. We're also mad at  the French and the Germans because they didn't help us invade Iraqe ither.<br /><br />Q: So the French and Germans are evil, too?<br />A: Not exactly evil, but just bad enough that we had to rename French fries and French toast to Freedom Fries and Freedom Toast.<br /><br />Q: Do we always rename foods whenever another country doesn't do what we want them to do?<br />A: No, we just do that to our friends. Our enemies, we  invade.<br /><br />Q: But wasn't Iraq one of our friends back in the  1980s?<br />A: Well, yeah. For a while.<br /><br />Q: Was Saddam Hussein ruler of Iraq back then?<br />A: Yes, but at the time he was fighting against Iran, which made him our friend, temporarily.<br /><br />Q: Why did that make him our friend?<br />A: Because at that time, Iran was our enemy.<br /><br />Q: Isn't that when he gassed the Kurds?<br />A: Yeah, but since he was fighting against Iran at the time, we looked the other way, to show him we were his friend.<br /><br />Q: So anyone who fights against one of our enemies automatically becomes our friend?<br />A: Most of the time, yes.<br /><br />Q: And anyone who fights against one of our friends is automatically an enemy?<br />A: Sometimes that's true, t! oo. However, if American corporations can profit by selling weapons to both sides at the same time, all  the better.<br /><br />Q: Why?<br />A: Because war is good for the economy, which meanswar is good for America. Also, since God is on America's side, anyone who opposes war is  a godless un-American Communist. Do you understand now why we attacked Iraq?<br /><br />Q: I think so. We attacked them because God wanted us to,r ight?<br />A: Yes.<br /><br />Q: But how did we know God wanted us to attack Iraq?<br />A: Well, you see, God personally speaks to George W. Bush and tells him what to do.<br /><br />Q: So basically, what you're saying is that we attacked Iraq because George W. Bush hears voices in his head?<br />A. Yes! You finally understand how the world works. Now close your eyes, make yourself comfortable, and go to sleep. Good night.<br /><br />Good night, Daddy.<br /></div></div>]]></body></post><post id="p13617" date="Posted: Sun Sep 28, 2003 6:00 am "><author>[sic]</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">That's great _shank.

It is Very difficult to positively identify the surface by just looking at it. So, how do we determine with any amount of certainty what type of mirror we are looking at? 
<br /><br />CONDUCT THIS SIMPLE TEST: Place the tip of your fingernail against the reflective surface and if there is a GAP between your fingernail and the image of the nail, then it is a GENUINE mirror. However, if your fingernail DIRECTLY TOUCHES the image of your nail, then BEWARE, IT IS A 2-WAY MIRROR! (there is someone seeing you from the other side).  The reason there is a gap on a real mirror, is because the silver is on the back of the mirror UNDER the glass. Whereas with a two-way mirror, the silver is on the surface. Keep it in mind! Make sure and check every time you enter in hotel rooms. May be someone is making a film on you.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p15645" date="Posted: Fri Nov 21, 2003 8:01 am "><author>Rayne</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">So basically, what you're saying is that we attacked Iraq because George W.

  <div class="quotecontent">The lizard brain<br /><br />Maybe you remember way back in school when you learned that the human brain still contains a prehistoric lizard brain at its center. This is the key to understanding women and what you can expect from them.<br /><br />Women still have direct contact with the lizard brain, something which men have been able to shut down about a trillion centuries ago.<br /><br />Have you ever noticed how women get cold very easily even if the temperature is only 1 µC below optimum? That's because lizards are cold-blooded, and a woman's lizard brain is telling her that she better get to a warm place quickly or her muscles will freeze up and her heart will stop beating.<br /><br />Have you noticed how a woman always seems to be thinking about two things at once? That's because a lizard's eyes point in two different directions, so it always has to process two completely different scenes.<br /><br />Have you noticed how two women can hate each other and have a serious fight, even if they don't know each other and they are sitting on opposite sides of the room? Lizards are very territorial and fight with each other by standing in one place and making threatening movements.<br /><br />Have you ever noticed how a woman drives? It's that two-direction eye problem again. That's why she thinks that it's possible to drive at high speed on a roundabout while looking in the mirror and adjusting her make-up.<br /><br />Have you noticed how a woman can sit somewhere completely happy, then suddenly out of nowhere she begins to cut you to pieces with her tongue? Well, just watch a lizard catch flies and you will know where that comes from.<br /><br />Women can lay in the sun on a big rock all day and never get bored.<br /><br />If a woman gets the chance, and she thinks that she can get away with it, she will color her hair orange and green and get it styled into a spiky hairdo. This is definitely a lizard haircut.<br /><br />I'm sure that there are hundreds of examples. The point is, the lizard brain theory explains everything. I am expecting to win the Nobel Prize this year.</div>

<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Hey,<br />This is a conversation between a father and a son...you will probably understand the reason why US attacked Iraq and how the world functions better after reading<br />this.<br /><br />Q: Daddy, why did we have to attack Iraq?<br />A: Because they had weapons of mass destruction,  honey.<br /><br />Q: But the inspectors didn't find any weapons of mass destruction.<br />A: That's because the Iraqis were hiding them.<br /><br />Q: And that's why we invaded Iraq?<br />A: Yep. Invasions always work better than  inspections.<br /><br />Q: But after we invaded them, we STILL didn't find any weapons  of mass destruction, did we?<br />A: That's because the weapons are so well hidden. Don't worry, we'll find something, probably right before the 2004 election.<br /><br />Q: Why did Iraq want all those weapons of mass  destruction?<br />A: To use them in a war, silly.<br /><br />Q: I'm confused. If they had all those weapons that they planned to use in a war, then why didn't they use any of those weapons when we  went to war with them?<br />A: Well, obviously they didn't want anyone to know they had  those weapons,so they chose to die by the thousands rather than defend themselves.<br /><br />Q: That doesn't make sense Daddy. Why would they choose to die  if they had all those big weapons to fight us back with?<br />A: It's a different culture. It's not supposed to make  sense.<br /><br />Q: I don't know about you, but I don't think they had any of those weapons our government said they did.<br />A: Well, you know, it doesn't matter whether or not they had those weapons. We had another good reason to invade them anyway.<br /><br />Q: And what was that?<br />A: Even if Iraq didn't have weapons of mass destruction, Saddam Hussein was a cruel dictator, which is another good reason to invade another country.<br /><br />Q: Why? What does a cruel dictator do that makes it OK to invade his country?<br />A: Well, for one thing, he tortured his own people.<br /><br />Q: Kind of like what they do in China?<br />A: Don't go comparing China to Iraq. China is a good economic competitor, where millions of people work for slave wages in sweatshops to make U.S. corporations richer.<br /><br />Q: So if a country lets its people be exploited for American corporate<br />gain, it's a good country, even if that country tortures people?<br />A: Right.<br /><br />Q: Why were people in Iraq being tortured?<br />A: For political crimes, mostly, like criticizing the  government. People who criticized the government in Iraq were sent to prison and tortured.<br /><br />Q: Isn't that exactly what happens in China?<br />A: I told you, China is different.<br /><br />Q: What's the difference between China and Iraq?<br />A: Well, for one thing, Iraq was ruled by the Ba'ath party, while China is Communist.<br /><br />Q: Didn't you once tell me Communists were bad?<br />A: No, just Cuban Communists are bad.<br /><br />Q: How are the Cuban Communists bad?<br />A: Well, for one thing, people who criticize the government in Cuba are sent to prison and tortured.<br /><br />Q: Like in Iraq?<br />A: Exactly.<br /><br />Q: And like in China, too?<br />A: I told you, China's a good economic competitor. Cuba, on the other hand, is not.<br /><br />Q: How come Cuba isn't a good economic competitor?<br />A: Well, you see, back in the early 1960s, our government passed some laws that made it illegal for Americans to trade or do any business with Cuba until they stopped being Communists and started being capitalists like us.<br /><br />Q: But if we got rid of those laws, opened up trade with Cuba,and started doing business with them, wouldn't that help the Cubans become capitalists?<br />A: Don't be a smart-ass.<br /><br />Q: I didn't think I was being one.<br />A: Well, anyway, they also don't have freedom of religion in Cuba.<br /><br />Q: Kind of like China and the @!#$ movement?<br />A: I told you, stop saying bad things about China. Anyway,  Saddam Hussein came to power through a military coup, so he's not really a legitimate leader anyway.<br /><br />Q: What's a military coup?<br />A: That's when a military general takes over the government of a country by force, instead of holding free elections like we do in the United States.<br /><br />Q: Didn't the ruler of Pakistan come to power by a military coup?<br />A: You mean General Pervez Musharraf? Uh, yeah, he did, but Pakistan is our friend.<br /><br />Q: Why is Pakistan our friend if their leader is illegitimate?<br />A: I never said Pervez Musharraf was illegitimate.<br /><br />Q: Didn't you just say a military general who comes to power by forcibly overthrowing the legitimate government of a nation is an illegitimate leader?<br />A: Only Saddam Hussein. Pervez Musharraf is our friend, because he helped us invade Afghanistan.<br /><br />Q: Why did we invade Afghanistan?<br />A: Because of what they did to us on September 11th.<br /><br />Q: What did Afghanistan do to us on September 11th?<br />A: Well, on September 11th, nineteen men, fifteen of them Saudi Arabians, hijacked four airplanes and flew three of them into buildings,killing over 3,000 Americans.<br /><br />Q: So how did Afghanistan figure into all that?<br />A: Afghanistan was where those bad men trained, under the oppressive rule of the Taliban.<br /><br />Q: Aren't the Taliban those bad radical Islamics who chopped off people's heads and hands?<br />A: Yes, that's exactly who they were. Not only did they chop off people's heads and hands, but they oppressed women, too.<br /><br />Q: Didn't the Bush administration giv e the Taliban 43 million dollars back in May of 2001?<br />A: Yes, but that money was a reward because they did such a good job fighting drugs.<br /><br />Q: Fighting drugs?<br />A: Yes, the Taliban were very helpful in stopping people from growing opium poppies.<br /><br />Q: How did they do such a good job?<br />A: Simple. If people were caught growing opium poppies, the Taliban would have their hands and heads cut off.<br /><br />Q: So, when the Taliban cut off people's heads and hands for growing flowers, that was OK, but not if they cut people's heads and hands off for other reasons?<br />A: Yes. It's OK with us if radical Islamic fundamentalists cut off people's hands for growing flowers, but it's cruel if they cut off people's hands for stealing bread.<br /><br />Q: Don't they also cut off people's hands and heads in Saudi Arabia?<br />A: That's different. Afghanistan was ruled by a tyrannical patriarchy that oppressed women and forced them to wear burqas whenever they  were in public, with death by stoning as the penalty for women who did not comply.<br /><br />Q: Don't Saudi women have to wear burqas in public,  too?<br />A: No, Saudi women merely wear a traditional Islamic body overing.<br /><br />Q: What's the difference?<br />A: The traditional Islamic co! vering worn by Saudi women is a modest yet fashionable garment that covers all of a woman's body xcept for her eyes and fingers. The burqa, on the other hand, is an evil tool of patriarchal oppression that covers all of a woman's body except for her eyes<br />and fingers.<br /><br />Q: It sounds like the same thing with a different  name.<br />A: Now, don't go comparing Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia. The Saudis are our friends.<br /><br />Q: But I thought you said 15 of the 19 hijackers on September 11th were from Saudi Arabia.<br />A: Yes, but they trained in Afghanistan.<br /><br />Q: Who trained them?<br />A: A very bad man named Osama bin Laden.<br /><br />Q: Was he from Afghanist! an?<br />A: Uh, no, he was from Saudi Arabia too. But he was a bad man, a very bad man.<br /><br />Q: I seem to recall he was our friend once.<br />A: Only when we helped him and the mujahadeen repel the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan back in the 1980s.<br /><br />Q: Who are the Soviets? Was that the Evil Communist Empire  Ronald Reagan talked about?<br />A: There are no more Soviets. The Soviet Union broke up in 1990 or there abouts, and now they have elections and capitalism like us. We call them Russians now.<br /><br />Q: So the Soviets, I mean, the Russians, are now our  friends?<br />A: Well, not really. You see, they were our friends for many years after they stopped being Soviets, bu t then they decided not to support our invasion of Iraq, so we're mad at them now. We're also mad at  the French and the Germans because they didn't help us invade Iraqe ither.<br /><br />Q: So the French and Germans are evil, too?<br />A: Not exactly evil, but just bad enough that we had to rename French fries and French toast to Freedom Fries and Freedom Toast.<br /><br />Q: Do we always rename foods whenever another country doesn't do what we want them to do?<br />A: No, we just do that to our friends. Our enemies, we  invade.<br /><br />Q: But wasn't Iraq one of our friends back in the  1980s?<br />A: Well, yeah. For a while.<br /><br />Q: Was Saddam Hussein ruler of Iraq back then?<br />A: Yes, but at the time he was fighting against Iran, which made him our friend, temporarily.<br /><br />Q: Why did that make him our friend?<br />A: Because at that time, Iran was our enemy.<br /><br />Q: Isn't that when he gassed the Kurds?<br />A: Yeah, but since he was fighting against Iran at the time, we looked the other way, to show him we were his friend.<br /><br />Q: So anyone who fights against one of our enemies automatically becomes our friend?<br />A: Most of the time, yes.<br /><br />Q: And anyone who fights against one of our friends is automatically an enemy?<br />A: Sometimes that's true, t! oo. However, if American corporations can profit by selling weapons to both sides at the same time, all  the better.<br /><br />Q: Why?<br />A: Because war is good for the economy, which meanswar is good for America. Also, since God is on America's side, anyone who opposes war is  a godless un-American Communist. Do you understand now why we attacked Iraq?<br /><br />Q: I think so. We attacked them because God wanted us to,r ight?<br />A: Yes.<br /><br />Q: But how did we know God wanted us to attack Iraq?<br />A: Well, you see, God personally speaks to George W. Bush and tells him what to do.<br /><br />Q: So basically, what you're saying is that we attacked Iraq because George W. Bush hears voices in his head?<br />A. Yes! You finally understand how the world works. Now close your eyes, make yourself comfortable, and go to sleep. Good night.<br /><br />Good night, Daddy.<br /></div></div>]]></body></post><post id="p13617" date="Posted: Sun Sep 28, 2003 6:00 am "><author>[sic]</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">That's great _shank.

It is Very difficult to positively identify the surface by just looking at it. So, how do we determine with any amount of certainty what type of mirror we are looking at? 
<br /><br />CONDUCT THIS SIMPLE TEST: Place the tip of your fingernail against the reflective surface and if there is a GAP between your fingernail and the image of the nail, then it is a GENUINE mirror. However, if your fingernail DIRECTLY TOUCHES the image of your nail, then BEWARE, IT IS A 2-WAY MIRROR! (there is someone seeing you from the other side).  The reason there is a gap on a real mirror, is because the silver is on the back of the mirror UNDER the glass. Whereas with a two-way mirror, the silver is on the surface. Keep it in mind! Make sure and check every time you enter in hotel rooms. May be someone is making a film on you.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p15645" date="Posted: Fri Nov 21, 2003 8:01 am "><author>Rayne</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">So basically, what you're saying is that we attacked Iraq because George W.

  <div class="quotecontent">The lizard brain<br /><br />Maybe you remember way back in school when you learned that the human brain still contains a prehistoric lizard brain at its center. This is the key to understanding women and what you can expect from them.<br /><br />Women still have direct contact with the lizard brain, something which men have been able to shut down about a trillion centuries ago.<br /><br />Have you ever noticed how women get cold very easily even if the temperature is only 1 µC below optimum? That's because lizards are cold-blooded, and a woman's lizard brain is telling her that she better get to a warm place quickly or her muscles will freeze up and her heart will stop beating.<br /><br />Have you noticed how a woman always seems to be thinking about two things at once? That's because a lizard's eyes point in two different directions, so it always has to process two completely different scenes.<br /><br />Have you noticed how two women can hate each other and have a serious fight, even if they don't know each other and they are sitting on opposite sides of the room? Lizards are very territorial and fight with each other by standing in one place and making threatening movements.<br /><br />Have you ever noticed how a woman drives? It's that two-direction eye problem again. That's why she thinks that it's possible to drive at high speed on a roundabout while looking in the mirror and adjusting her make-up.<br /><br />Have you noticed how a woman can sit somewhere completely happy, then suddenly out of nowhere she begins to cut you to pieces with her tongue? Well, just watch a lizard catch flies and you will know where that comes from.<br /><br />Women can lay in the sun on a big rock all day and never get bored.<br /><br />If a woman gets the chance, and she thinks that she can get away with it, she will color her hair orange and green and get it styled into a spiky hairdo. This is definitely a lizard haircut.<br /><br />I'm sure that there are hundreds of examples. The point is, the lizard brain theory explains everything. I am expecting to win the Nobel Prize this year.</div>

<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Hey,<br />This is a conversation between a father and a son...you will probably understand the reason why US attacked Iraq and how the world functions better after reading<br />this.<br /><br />Q: Daddy, why did we have to attack Iraq?<br />A: Because they had weapons of mass destruction,  honey.<br /><br />Q: But the inspectors didn't find any weapons of mass destruction.<br />A: That's because the Iraqis were hiding them.<br /><br />Q: And that's why we invaded Iraq?<br />A: Yep. Invasions always work better than  inspections.<br /><br />Q: But after we invaded them, we STILL didn't find any weapons  of mass destruction, did we?<br />A: That's because the weapons are so well hidden. Don't worry, we'll find something, probably right before the 2004 election.<br /><br />Q: Why did Iraq want all those weapons of mass  destruction?<br />A: To use them in a war, silly.<br /><br />Q: I'm confused. If they had all those weapons that they planned to use in a war, then why didn't they use any of those weapons when we  went to war with them?<br />A: Well, obviously they didn't want anyone to know they had  those weapons,so they chose to die by the thousands rather than defend themselves.<br /><br />Q: That doesn't make sense Daddy. Why would they choose to die  if they had all those big weapons to fight us back with?<br />A: It's a different culture. It's not supposed to make  sense.<br /><br />Q: I don't know about you, but I don't think they had any of those weapons our government said they did.<br />A: Well, you know, it doesn't matter whether or not they had those weapons. We had another good reason to invade them anyway.<br /><br />Q: And what was that?<br />A: Even if Iraq didn't have weapons of mass destruction, Saddam Hussein was a cruel dictator, which is another good reason to invade another country.<br /><br />Q: Why? What does a cruel dictator do that makes it OK to invade his country?<br />A: Well, for one thing, he tortured his own people.<br /><br />Q: Kind of like what they do in China?<br />A: Don't go comparing China to Iraq. China is a good economic competitor, where millions of people work for slave wages in sweatshops to make U.S. corporations richer.<br /><br />Q: So if a country lets its people be exploited for American corporate<br />gain, it's a good country, even if that country tortures people?<br />A: Right.<br /><br />Q: Why were people in Iraq being tortured?<br />A: For political crimes, mostly, like criticizing the  government. People who criticized the government in Iraq were sent to prison and tortured.<br /><br />Q: Isn't that exactly what happens in China?<br />A: I told you, China is different.<br /><br />Q: What's the difference between China and Iraq?<br />A: Well, for one thing, Iraq was ruled by the Ba'ath party, while China is Communist.<br /><br />Q: Didn't you once tell me Communists were bad?<br />A: No, just Cuban Communists are bad.<br /><br />Q: How are the Cuban Communists bad?<br />A: Well, for one thing, people who criticize the government in Cuba are sent to prison and tortured.<br /><br />Q: Like in Iraq?<br />A: Exactly.<br /><br />Q: And like in China, too?<br />A: I told you, China's a good economic competitor. Cuba, on the other hand, is not.<br /><br />Q: How come Cuba isn't a good economic competitor?<br />A: Well, you see, back in the early 1960s, our government passed some laws that made it illegal for Americans to trade or do any business with Cuba until they stopped being Communists and started being capitalists like us.<br /><br />Q: But if we got rid of those laws, opened up trade with Cuba,and started doing business with them, wouldn't that help the Cubans become capitalists?<br />A: Don't be a smart-ass.<br /><br />Q: I didn't think I was being one.<br />A: Well, anyway, they also don't have freedom of religion in Cuba.<br /><br />Q: Kind of like China and the @!#$ movement?<br />A: I told you, stop saying bad things about China. Anyway,  Saddam Hussein came to power through a military coup, so he's not really a legitimate leader anyway.<br /><br />Q: What's a military coup?<br />A: That's when a military general takes over the government of a country by force, instead of holding free elections like we do in the United States.<br /><br />Q: Didn't the ruler of Pakistan come to power by a military coup?<br />A: You mean General Pervez Musharraf? Uh, yeah, he did, but Pakistan is our friend.<br /><br />Q: Why is Pakistan our friend if their leader is illegitimate?<br />A: I never said Pervez Musharraf was illegitimate.<br /><br />Q: Didn't you just say a military general who comes to power by forcibly overthrowing the legitimate government of a nation is an illegitimate leader?<br />A: Only Saddam Hussein. Pervez Musharraf is our friend, because he helped us invade Afghanistan.<br /><br />Q: Why did we invade Afghanistan?<br />A: Because of what they did to us on September 11th.<br /><br />Q: What did Afghanistan do to us on September 11th?<br />A: Well, on September 11th, nineteen men, fifteen of them Saudi Arabians, hijacked four airplanes and flew three of them into buildings,killing over 3,000 Americans.<br /><br />Q: So how did Afghanistan figure into all that?<br />A: Afghanistan was where those bad men trained, under the oppressive rule of the Taliban.<br /><br />Q: Aren't the Taliban those bad radical Islamics who chopped off people's heads and hands?<br />A: Yes, that's exactly who they were. Not only did they chop off people's heads and hands, but they oppressed women, too.<br /><br />Q: Didn't the Bush administration giv e the Taliban 43 million dollars back in May of 2001?<br />A: Yes, but that money was a reward because they did such a good job fighting drugs.<br /><br />Q: Fighting drugs?<br />A: Yes, the Taliban were very helpful in stopping people from growing opium poppies.<br /><br />Q: How did they do such a good job?<br />A: Simple. If people were caught growing opium poppies, the Taliban would have their hands and heads cut off.<br /><br />Q: So, when the Taliban cut off people's heads and hands for growing flowers, that was OK, but not if they cut people's heads and hands off for other reasons?<br />A: Yes. It's OK with us if radical Islamic fundamentalists cut off people's hands for growing flowers, but it's cruel if they cut off people's hands for stealing bread.<br /><br />Q: Don't they also cut off people's hands and heads in Saudi Arabia?<br />A: That's different. Afghanistan was ruled by a tyrannical patriarchy that oppressed women and forced them to wear burqas whenever they  were in public, with death by stoning as the penalty for women who did not comply.<br /><br />Q: Don't Saudi women have to wear burqas in public,  too?<br />A: No, Saudi women merely wear a traditional Islamic body overing.<br /><br />Q: What's the difference?<br />A: The traditional Islamic co! vering worn by Saudi women is a modest yet fashionable garment that covers all of a woman's body xcept for her eyes and fingers. The burqa, on the other hand, is an evil tool of patriarchal oppression that covers all of a woman's body except for her eyes<br />and fingers.<br /><br />Q: It sounds like the same thing with a different  name.<br />A: Now, don't go comparing Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia. The Saudis are our friends.<br /><br />Q: But I thought you said 15 of the 19 hijackers on September 11th were from Saudi Arabia.<br />A: Yes, but they trained in Afghanistan.<br /><br />Q: Who trained them?<br />A: A very bad man named Osama bin Laden.<br /><br />Q: Was he from Afghanist! an?<br />A: Uh, no, he was from Saudi Arabia too. But he was a bad man, a very bad man.<br /><br />Q: I seem to recall he was our friend once.<br />A: Only when we helped him and the mujahadeen repel the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan back in the 1980s.<br /><br />Q: Who are the Soviets? Was that the Evil Communist Empire  Ronald Reagan talked about?<br />A: There are no more Soviets. The Soviet Union broke up in 1990 or there abouts, and now they have elections and capitalism like us. We call them Russians now.<br /><br />Q: So the Soviets, I mean, the Russians, are now our  friends?<br />A: Well, not really. You see, they were our friends for many years after they stopped being Soviets, bu t then they decided not to support our invasion of Iraq, so we're mad at them now. We're also mad at  the French and the Germans because they didn't help us invade Iraqe ither.<br /><br />Q: So the French and Germans are evil, too?<br />A: Not exactly evil, but just bad enough that we had to rename French fries and French toast to Freedom Fries and Freedom Toast.<br /><br />Q: Do we always rename foods whenever another country doesn't do what we want them to do?<br />A: No, we just do that to our friends. Our enemies, we  invade.<br /><br />Q: But wasn't Iraq one of our friends back in the  1980s?<br />A: Well, yeah. For a while.<br /><br />Q: Was Saddam Hussein ruler of Iraq back then?<br />A: Yes, but at the time he was fighting against Iran, which made him our friend, temporarily.<br /><br />Q: Why did that make him our friend?<br />A: Because at that time, Iran was our enemy.<br /><br />Q: Isn't that when he gassed the Kurds?<br />A: Yeah, but since he was fighting against Iran at the time, we looked the other way, to show him we were his friend.<br /><br />Q: So anyone who fights against one of our enemies automatically becomes our friend?<br />A: Most of the time, yes.<br /><br />Q: And anyone who fights against one of our friends is automatically an enemy?<br />A: Sometimes that's true, t! oo. However, if American corporations can profit by selling weapons to both sides at the same time, all  the better.<br /><br />Q: Why?<br />A: Because war is good for the economy, which meanswar is good for America. Also, since God is on America's side, anyone who opposes war is  a godless un-American Communist. Do you understand now why we attacked Iraq?<br /><br />Q: I think so. We attacked them because God wanted us to,r ight?<br />A: Yes.<br /><br />Q: But how did we know God wanted us to attack Iraq?<br />A: Well, you see, God personally speaks to George W. Bush and tells him what to do.<br /><br />Q: So basically, what you're saying is that we attacked Iraq because George W. Bush hears voices in his head?<br />A. Yes! You finally understand how the world works. Now close your eyes, make yourself comfortable, and go to sleep.

It is Very difficult to positively identify the surface by just looking at it. So, how do we determine with any amount of certainty what type of mirror we are looking at? 
<br /><br />CONDUCT THIS SIMPLE TEST: Place the tip of your fingernail against the reflective surface and if there is a GAP between your fingernail and the image of the nail, then it is a GENUINE mirror. However, if your fingernail DIRECTLY TOUCHES the image of your nail, then BEWARE, IT IS A 2-WAY MIRROR! (there is someone seeing you from the other side).  The reason there is a gap on a real mirror, is because the silver is on the back of the mirror UNDER the glass. Whereas with a two-way mirror, the silver is on the surface. Keep it in mind! Make sure and check every time you enter in hotel rooms. May be someone is making a film on you.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p15645" date="Posted: Fri Nov 21, 2003 8:01 am "><author>Rayne</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">So basically, what you're saying is that we attacked Iraq because George W.

<br/><br/>
Maybe you remember way back in school when you learned that the human brain still contains a prehistoric lizard brain at its center. This is the key to understanding women and what you can expect from them.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Women still have direct contact with the lizard brain, something which men have been able to shut down about a trillion centuries ago.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Have you ever noticed how women get cold very easily even if the temperature is only 1 ÂµC below optimum? That's because lizards are cold-blooded, and a woman's lizard brain is telling her that she better get to a warm place quickly or her muscles will freeze up and her heart will stop beating.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Have you noticed how a woman always seems to be thinking about two things at once? That's because a lizard's eyes point in two different directions, so it always has to process two completely different scenes.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Have you noticed how two women can hate each other and have a serious fight, even if they don't know each other and they are sitting on opposite sides of the room? Lizards are very territorial and fight with each other by standing in one place and making threatening movements.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Have you ever noticed how a woman drives? It's that two-direction eye problem again. That's why she thinks that it's possible to drive at high speed on a roundabout while looking in the mirror and adjusting her make-up.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Have you noticed how a woman can sit somewhere completely happy, then suddenly out of nowhere she begins to cut you to pieces with her tongue? Well, just watch a lizard catch flies and you will know where that comes from.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Women can lay in the sun on a big rock all day and never get bored.&#13;
<br/><br/>
If a woman gets the chance, and she thinks that she can get away with it, she will color her hair orange and green and get it styled into a spiky hairdo. This is definitely a lizard haircut.&#13;
<br/><br/>
I'm sure that there are hundreds of examples. The point is, the lizard brain theory explains everything. I am expecting to win the Nobel Prize this year.</td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody"><br/>_________________<br/><a href="/web/20050314084751/http://www.doom3world.org/" target="_blank" class="postlink"><img src="/web/20050314084751im_/http://www.doom3world.org/site/img/d3w.gif" border="0"/> Staff - The world is yours</a></span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

I know what you're thinking: "Anal sex?! Gross! No way!" But it's so cool! My boyfriends get totally turned on by watching me lube up, and I don't worry anymore about getting pregnant. And anal is definitely the fast track to the "in" crowd: Ever since I started taking it anal, I've been way popular at school!&#13;
<br/><br/><br/>
JEREMY T., Holyoke, MA&#13;
<br/>
I have to admit, when I first suggested anal sex to my girlfriend, she looked at me like I was crazy. I offered to double-wrap, use plenty of AstroGlide, but she was still totally freaked over the idea of it. Then she made a deal with me: If I'd bend over for her strap-on, she'd bend over for me. We take turns taking it up the poop chute, and now we finally feel like our relationship is fully equal.</td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody">&#13;

Hey,&#13;
<br/>
This is a conversation between a father and a son...you will probably understand the reason why US attacked Iraq and how the world functions better after reading&#13;
<br/>
this.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Daddy, why did we have to attack Iraq?&#13;
<br/>
A: Because they had weapons of mass destruction,  honey.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: But the inspectors didn't find any weapons of mass destruction.&#13;
<br/>
A: That's because the Iraqis were hiding them.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: And that's why we invaded Iraq?&#13;
<br/>
A: Yep. Invasions always work better than  inspections.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: But after we invaded them, we STILL didn't find any weapons  of mass destruction, did we?&#13;
<br/>
A: That's because the weapons are so well hidden. Don't worry, we'll find something, probably right before the 2004 election.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Why did Iraq want all those weapons of mass  destruction?&#13;
<br/>
A: To use them in a war, silly.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: I'm confused. If they had all those weapons that they planned to use in a war, then why didn't they use any of those weapons when we  went to war with them?&#13;
<br/>
A: Well, obviously they didn't want anyone to know they had  those weapons,so they chose to die by the thousands rather than defend themselves.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: That doesn't make sense Daddy. Why would they choose to die  if they had all those big weapons to fight us back with?&#13;
<br/>
A: It's a different culture. It's not supposed to make  sense.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: I don't know about you, but I don't think they had any of those weapons our government said they did.&#13;
<br/>
A: Well, you know, it doesn't matter whether or not they had those weapons. We had another good reason to invade them anyway.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: And what was that?&#13;
<br/>
A: Even if Iraq didn't have weapons of mass destruction, Saddam Hussein was a cruel dictator, which is another good reason to invade another country.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Why? What does a cruel dictator do that makes it OK to invade his country?&#13;
<br/>
A: Well, for one thing, he tortured his own people.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Kind of like what they do in China?&#13;
<br/>
A: Don't go comparing China to Iraq. China is a good economic competitor, where millions of people work for slave wages in sweatshops to make U.S. corporations richer.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: So if a country lets its people be exploited for American corporate&#13;
<br/>
gain, it's a good country, even if that country tortures people?&#13;
<br/>
A: Right.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Why were people in Iraq being tortured?&#13;
<br/>
A: For political crimes, mostly, like criticizing the  government. People who criticized the government in Iraq were sent to prison and tortured.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Isn't that exactly what happens in China?&#13;
<br/>
A: I told you, China is different.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: What's the difference between China and Iraq?&#13;
<br/>
A: Well, for one thing, Iraq was ruled by the Ba'ath party, while China is Communist.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Didn't you once tell me Communists were bad?&#13;
<br/>
A: No, just Cuban Communists are bad.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: How are the Cuban Communists bad?&#13;
<br/>
A: Well, for one thing, people who criticize the government in Cuba are sent to prison and tortured.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Like in Iraq?&#13;
<br/>
A: Exactly.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: And like in China, too?&#13;
<br/>
A: I told you, China's a good economic competitor. Cuba, on the other hand, is not.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: How come Cuba isn't a good economic competitor?&#13;
<br/>
A: Well, you see, back in the early 1960s, our government passed some laws that made it illegal for Americans to trade or do any business with Cuba until they stopped being Communists and started being capitalists like us.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: But if we got rid of those laws, opened up trade with Cuba,and started doing business with them, wouldn't that help the Cubans become capitalists?&#13;
<br/>
A: Don't be a smart-ass.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: I didn't think I was being one.&#13;
<br/>
A: Well, anyway, they also don't have freedom of religion in Cuba.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Kind of like China and the @!#$ movement?&#13;
<br/>
A: I told you, stop saying bad things about China. Anyway,  Saddam Hussein came to power through a military coup, so he's not really a legitimate leader anyway.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: What's a military coup?&#13;
<br/>
A: That's when a military general takes over the government of a country by force, instead of holding free elections like we do in the United States.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Didn't the ruler of Pakistan come to power by a military coup?&#13;
<br/>
A: You mean General Pervez Musharraf? Uh, yeah, he did, but Pakistan is our friend.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Why is Pakistan our friend if their leader is illegitimate?&#13;
<br/>
A: I never said Pervez Musharraf was illegitimate.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Didn't you just say a military general who comes to power by forcibly overthrowing the legitimate government of a nation is an illegitimate leader?&#13;
<br/>
A: Only Saddam Hussein. Pervez Musharraf is our friend, because he helped us invade Afghanistan.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Why did we invade Afghanistan?&#13;
<br/>
A: Because of what they did to us on September 11th.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: What did Afghanistan do to us on September 11th?&#13;
<br/>
A: Well, on September 11th, nineteen men, fifteen of them Saudi Arabians, hijacked four airplanes and flew three of them into buildings,killing over 3,000 Americans.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: So how did Afghanistan figure into all that?&#13;
<br/>
A: Afghanistan was where those bad men trained, under the oppressive rule of the Taliban.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Aren't the Taliban those bad radical Islamics who chopped off people's heads and hands?&#13;
<br/>
A: Yes, that's exactly who they were. Not only did they chop off people's heads and hands, but they oppressed women, too.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Didn't the Bush administration giv e the Taliban 43 million dollars back in May of 2001?&#13;
<br/>
A: Yes, but that money was a reward because they did such a good job fighting drugs.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Fighting drugs?&#13;
<br/>
A: Yes, the Taliban were very helpful in stopping people from growing opium poppies.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: How did they do such a good job?&#13;
<br/>
A: Simple. If people were caught growing opium poppies, the Taliban would have their hands and heads cut off.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: So, when the Taliban cut off people's heads and hands for growing flowers, that was OK, but not if they cut people's heads and hands off for other reasons?&#13;
<br/>
A: Yes. It's OK with us if radical Islamic fundamentalists cut off people's hands for growing flowers, but it's cruel if they cut off people's hands for stealing bread.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Don't they also cut off people's hands and heads in Saudi Arabia?&#13;
<br/>
A: That's different. Afghanistan was ruled by a tyrannical patriarchy that oppressed women and forced them to wear burqas whenever they  were in public, with death by stoning as the penalty for women who did not comply.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Don't Saudi women have to wear burqas in public,  too?&#13;
<br/>
A: No, Saudi women merely wear a traditional Islamic body overing.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: What's the difference?&#13;
<br/>
A: The traditional Islamic co! vering worn by Saudi women is a modest yet fashionable garment that covers all of a woman's body xcept for her eyes and fingers. The burqa, on the other hand, is an evil tool of patriarchal oppression that covers all of a woman's body except for her eyes&#13;
<br/>
and fingers.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: It sounds like the same thing with a different  name.&#13;
<br/>
A: Now, don't go comparing Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia. The Saudis are our friends.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: But I thought you said 15 of the 19 hijackers on September 11th were from Saudi Arabia.&#13;
<br/>
A: Yes, but they trained in Afghanistan.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Who trained them?&#13;
<br/>
A: A very bad man named Osama bin Laden.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Was he from Afghanist! an?&#13;
<br/>
A: Uh, no, he was from Saudi Arabia too. But he was a bad man, a very bad man.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: I seem to recall he was our friend once.&#13;
<br/>
A: Only when we helped him and the mujahadeen repel the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan back in the 1980s.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Who are the Soviets? Was that the Evil Communist Empire  Ronald Reagan talked about?&#13;
<br/>
A: There are no more Soviets. The Soviet Union broke up in 1990 or there abouts, and now they have elections and capitalism like us. We call them Russians now.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: So the Soviets, I mean, the Russians, are now our  friends?&#13;
<br/>
A: Well, not really. You see, they were our friends for many years after they stopped being Soviets, bu t then they decided not to support our invasion of Iraq, so we're mad at them now. We're also mad at  the French and the Germans because they didn't help us invade Iraqe ither.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: So the French and Germans are evil, too?&#13;
<br/>
A: Not exactly evil, but just bad enough that we had to rename French fries and French toast to Freedom Fries and Freedom Toast.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Do we always rename foods whenever another country doesn't do what we want them to do?&#13;
<br/>
A: No, we just do that to our friends. Our enemies, we  invade.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: But wasn't Iraq one of our friends back in the  1980s?&#13;
<br/>
A: Well, yeah. For a while.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Was Saddam Hussein ruler of Iraq back then?&#13;
<br/>
A: Yes, but at the time he was fighting against Iran, which made him our friend, temporarily.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Why did that make him our friend?&#13;
<br/>
A: Because at that time, Iran was our enemy.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Isn't that when he gassed the Kurds?&#13;
<br/>
A: Yeah, but since he was fighting against Iran at the time, we looked the other way, to show him we were his friend.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: So anyone who fights against one of our enemies automatically becomes our friend?&#13;
<br/>
A: Most of the time, yes.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: And anyone who fights against one of our friends is automatically an enemy?&#13;
<br/>
A: Sometimes that's true, t! oo. However, if American corporations can profit by selling weapons to both sides at the same time, all  the better.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Why?&#13;
<br/>
A: Because war is good for the economy, which meanswar is good for America. Also, since God is on America's side, anyone who opposes war is  a godless un-American Communist. Do you understand now why we attacked Iraq?&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: I think so. We attacked them because God wanted us to,r ight?&#13;
<br/>
A: Yes.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: But how did we know God wanted us to attack Iraq?&#13;
<br/>
A: Well, you see, God personally speaks to George W. Bush and tells him what to do.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: So basically, what you're saying is that we attacked Iraq because George W. Bush hears voices in his head?&#13;
<br/>
A. Yes! You finally understand how the world works. Now close your eyes, make yourself comfortable, and go to sleep. Good night.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Good night, Daddy.&#13;

It is Very difficult to positively identify the surface by just looking at it. So, how do we determine with any amount of certainty what type of mirror we are looking at? &#13;
<br/><br/>
CONDUCT THIS SIMPLE TEST: Place the tip of your fingernail against the reflective surface and if there is a GAP between your fingernail and the image of the nail, then it is a GENUINE mirror. However, if your fingernail DIRECTLY TOUCHES the image of your nail, then BEWARE, IT IS A 2-WAY MIRROR! (there is someone seeing you from the other side).  The reason there is a gap on a real mirror, is because the silver is on the back of the mirror UNDER the glass. Whereas with a two-way mirror, the silver is on the surface. Keep it in mind! Make sure and check every time you enter in hotel rooms. May be someone is making a film on you.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="/web/20050314084751/http://www.geocities.com/web_shank/index.html" target="_blank" class="postlink"><span style="font-weight: bold">Plz post only 640x480 ss and add those damn trims to the floor and walls!!!</span></a></span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

<br/><br/>
Maybe you remember way back in school when you learned that the human brain still contains a prehistoric lizard brain at its center. This is the key to understanding women and what you can expect from them.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Women still have direct contact with the lizard brain, something which men have been able to shut down about a trillion centuries ago.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Have you ever noticed how women get cold very easily even if the temperature is only 1 ÂµC below optimum? That's because lizards are cold-blooded, and a woman's lizard brain is telling her that she better get to a warm place quickly or her muscles will freeze up and her heart will stop beating.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Have you noticed how a woman always seems to be thinking about two things at once? That's because a lizard's eyes point in two different directions, so it always has to process two completely different scenes.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Have you noticed how two women can hate each other and have a serious fight, even if they don't know each other and they are sitting on opposite sides of the room? Lizards are very territorial and fight with each other by standing in one place and making threatening movements.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Have you ever noticed how a woman drives? It's that two-direction eye problem again. That's why she thinks that it's possible to drive at high speed on a roundabout while looking in the mirror and adjusting her make-up.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Have you noticed how a woman can sit somewhere completely happy, then suddenly out of nowhere she begins to cut you to pieces with her tongue? Well, just watch a lizard catch flies and you will know where that comes from.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Women can lay in the sun on a big rock all day and never get bored.&#13;
<br/><br/>
If a woman gets the chance, and she thinks that she can get away with it, she will color her hair orange and green and get it styled into a spiky hairdo. This is definitely a lizard haircut.&#13;
<br/><br/>
I'm sure that there are hundreds of examples. The point is, the lizard brain theory explains everything. I am expecting to win the Nobel Prize this year.</td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody"><br/>_________________<br/><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050827070553/http://www.doom3world.org/" target="_blank" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20050827070553im_/http://www.doom3world.org/site/img/d3w.gif" border="0"/> Staff - The world is yours</a></span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

I know what you're thinking: "Anal sex?! Gross! No way!" But it's so cool! My boyfriends get totally turned on by watching me lube up, and I don't worry anymore about getting pregnant. And anal is definitely the fast track to the "in" crowd: Ever since I started taking it anal, I've been way popular at school!&#13;
<br/><br/><br/>
JEREMY T., Holyoke, MA&#13;
<br/>
I have to admit, when I first suggested anal sex to my girlfriend, she looked at me like I was crazy. I offered to double-wrap, use plenty of AstroGlide, but she was still totally freaked over the idea of it. Then she made a deal with me: If I'd bend over for her strap-on, she'd bend over for me. We take turns taking it up the poop chute, and now we finally feel like our relationship is fully equal.</td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody">&#13;

Hey,&#13;
<br/>
This is a conversation between a father and a son...you will probably understand the reason why US attacked Iraq and how the world functions better after reading&#13;
<br/>
this.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Daddy, why did we have to attack Iraq?&#13;
<br/>
A: Because they had weapons of mass destruction,  honey.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: But the inspectors didn't find any weapons of mass destruction.&#13;
<br/>
A: That's because the Iraqis were hiding them.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: And that's why we invaded Iraq?&#13;
<br/>
A: Yep. Invasions always work better than  inspections.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: But after we invaded them, we STILL didn't find any weapons  of mass destruction, did we?&#13;
<br/>
A: That's because the weapons are so well hidden. Don't worry, we'll find something, probably right before the 2004 election.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Why did Iraq want all those weapons of mass  destruction?&#13;
<br/>
A: To use them in a war, silly.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: I'm confused. If they had all those weapons that they planned to use in a war, then why didn't they use any of those weapons when we  went to war with them?&#13;
<br/>
A: Well, obviously they didn't want anyone to know they had  those weapons,so they chose to die by the thousands rather than defend themselves.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: That doesn't make sense Daddy. Why would they choose to die  if they had all those big weapons to fight us back with?&#13;
<br/>
A: It's a different culture. It's not supposed to make  sense.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: I don't know about you, but I don't think they had any of those weapons our government said they did.&#13;
<br/>
A: Well, you know, it doesn't matter whether or not they had those weapons. We had another good reason to invade them anyway.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: And what was that?&#13;
<br/>
A: Even if Iraq didn't have weapons of mass destruction, Saddam Hussein was a cruel dictator, which is another good reason to invade another country.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Why? What does a cruel dictator do that makes it OK to invade his country?&#13;
<br/>
A: Well, for one thing, he tortured his own people.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Kind of like what they do in China?&#13;
<br/>
A: Don't go comparing China to Iraq. China is a good economic competitor, where millions of people work for slave wages in sweatshops to make U.S. corporations richer.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: So if a country lets its people be exploited for American corporate&#13;
<br/>
gain, it's a good country, even if that country tortures people?&#13;
<br/>
A: Right.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Why were people in Iraq being tortured?&#13;
<br/>
A: For political crimes, mostly, like criticizing the  government. People who criticized the government in Iraq were sent to prison and tortured.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Isn't that exactly what happens in China?&#13;
<br/>
A: I told you, China is different.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: What's the difference between China and Iraq?&#13;
<br/>
A: Well, for one thing, Iraq was ruled by the Ba'ath party, while China is Communist.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Didn't you once tell me Communists were bad?&#13;
<br/>
A: No, just Cuban Communists are bad.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: How are the Cuban Communists bad?&#13;
<br/>
A: Well, for one thing, people who criticize the government in Cuba are sent to prison and tortured.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Like in Iraq?&#13;
<br/>
A: Exactly.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: And like in China, too?&#13;
<br/>
A: I told you, China's a good economic competitor. Cuba, on the other hand, is not.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: How come Cuba isn't a good economic competitor?&#13;
<br/>
A: Well, you see, back in the early 1960s, our government passed some laws that made it illegal for Americans to trade or do any business with Cuba until they stopped being Communists and started being capitalists like us.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: But if we got rid of those laws, opened up trade with Cuba,and started doing business with them, wouldn't that help the Cubans become capitalists?&#13;
<br/>
A: Don't be a smart-ass.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: I didn't think I was being one.&#13;
<br/>
A: Well, anyway, they also don't have freedom of religion in Cuba.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Kind of like China and the @!#$ movement?&#13;
<br/>
A: I told you, stop saying bad things about China. Anyway,  Saddam Hussein came to power through a military coup, so he's not really a legitimate leader anyway.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: What's a military coup?&#13;
<br/>
A: That's when a military general takes over the government of a country by force, instead of holding free elections like we do in the United States.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Didn't the ruler of Pakistan come to power by a military coup?&#13;
<br/>
A: You mean General Pervez Musharraf? Uh, yeah, he did, but Pakistan is our friend.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Why is Pakistan our friend if their leader is illegitimate?&#13;
<br/>
A: I never said Pervez Musharraf was illegitimate.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Didn't you just say a military general who comes to power by forcibly overthrowing the legitimate government of a nation is an illegitimate leader?&#13;
<br/>
A: Only Saddam Hussein. Pervez Musharraf is our friend, because he helped us invade Afghanistan.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Why did we invade Afghanistan?&#13;
<br/>
A: Because of what they did to us on September 11th.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: What did Afghanistan do to us on September 11th?&#13;
<br/>
A: Well, on September 11th, nineteen men, fifteen of them Saudi Arabians, hijacked four airplanes and flew three of them into buildings,killing over 3,000 Americans.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: So how did Afghanistan figure into all that?&#13;
<br/>
A: Afghanistan was where those bad men trained, under the oppressive rule of the Taliban.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Aren't the Taliban those bad radical Islamics who chopped off people's heads and hands?&#13;
<br/>
A: Yes, that's exactly who they were. Not only did they chop off people's heads and hands, but they oppressed women, too.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Didn't the Bush administration giv e the Taliban 43 million dollars back in May of 2001?&#13;
<br/>
A: Yes, but that money was a reward because they did such a good job fighting drugs.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Fighting drugs?&#13;
<br/>
A: Yes, the Taliban were very helpful in stopping people from growing opium poppies.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: How did they do such a good job?&#13;
<br/>
A: Simple. If people were caught growing opium poppies, the Taliban would have their hands and heads cut off.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: So, when the Taliban cut off people's heads and hands for growing flowers, that was OK, but not if they cut people's heads and hands off for other reasons?&#13;
<br/>
A: Yes. It's OK with us if radical Islamic fundamentalists cut off people's hands for growing flowers, but it's cruel if they cut off people's hands for stealing bread.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Don't they also cut off people's hands and heads in Saudi Arabia?&#13;
<br/>
A: That's different. Afghanistan was ruled by a tyrannical patriarchy that oppressed women and forced them to wear burqas whenever they  were in public, with death by stoning as the penalty for women who did not comply.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Don't Saudi women have to wear burqas in public,  too?&#13;
<br/>
A: No, Saudi women merely wear a traditional Islamic body overing.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: What's the difference?&#13;
<br/>
A: The traditional Islamic co! vering worn by Saudi women is a modest yet fashionable garment that covers all of a woman's body xcept for her eyes and fingers. The burqa, on the other hand, is an evil tool of patriarchal oppression that covers all of a woman's body except for her eyes&#13;
<br/>
and fingers.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: It sounds like the same thing with a different  name.&#13;
<br/>
A: Now, don't go comparing Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia. The Saudis are our friends.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: But I thought you said 15 of the 19 hijackers on September 11th were from Saudi Arabia.&#13;
<br/>
A: Yes, but they trained in Afghanistan.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Who trained them?&#13;
<br/>
A: A very bad man named Osama bin Laden.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Was he from Afghanist! an?&#13;
<br/>
A: Uh, no, he was from Saudi Arabia too. But he was a bad man, a very bad man.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: I seem to recall he was our friend once.&#13;
<br/>
A: Only when we helped him and the mujahadeen repel the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan back in the 1980s.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Who are the Soviets? Was that the Evil Communist Empire  Ronald Reagan talked about?&#13;
<br/>
A: There are no more Soviets. The Soviet Union broke up in 1990 or there abouts, and now they have elections and capitalism like us. We call them Russians now.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: So the Soviets, I mean, the Russians, are now our  friends?&#13;
<br/>
A: Well, not really. You see, they were our friends for many years after they stopped being Soviets, bu t then they decided not to support our invasion of Iraq, so we're mad at them now. We're also mad at  the French and the Germans because they didn't help us invade Iraqe ither.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: So the French and Germans are evil, too?&#13;
<br/>
A: Not exactly evil, but just bad enough that we had to rename French fries and French toast to Freedom Fries and Freedom Toast.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Do we always rename foods whenever another country doesn't do what we want them to do?&#13;
<br/>
A: No, we just do that to our friends. Our enemies, we  invade.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: But wasn't Iraq one of our friends back in the  1980s?&#13;
<br/>
A: Well, yeah. For a while.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Was Saddam Hussein ruler of Iraq back then?&#13;
<br/>
A: Yes, but at the time he was fighting against Iran, which made him our friend, temporarily.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Why did that make him our friend?&#13;
<br/>
A: Because at that time, Iran was our enemy.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Isn't that when he gassed the Kurds?&#13;
<br/>
A: Yeah, but since he was fighting against Iran at the time, we looked the other way, to show him we were his friend.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: So anyone who fights against one of our enemies automatically becomes our friend?&#13;
<br/>
A: Most of the time, yes.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: And anyone who fights against one of our friends is automatically an enemy?&#13;
<br/>
A: Sometimes that's true, t! oo. However, if American corporations can profit by selling weapons to both sides at the same time, all  the better.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Why?&#13;
<br/>
A: Because war is good for the economy, which meanswar is good for America. Also, since God is on America's side, anyone who opposes war is  a godless un-American Communist. Do you understand now why we attacked Iraq?&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: I think so. We attacked them because God wanted us to,r ight?&#13;
<br/>
A: Yes.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: But how did we know God wanted us to attack Iraq?&#13;
<br/>
A: Well, you see, God personally speaks to George W. Bush and tells him what to do.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: So basically, what you're saying is that we attacked Iraq because George W. Bush hears voices in his head?&#13;
<br/>
A. Yes! You finally understand how the world works. Now close your eyes, make yourself comfortable, and go to sleep. Good night.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Good night, Daddy.&#13;

It is Very difficult to positively identify the surface by just looking at it. So, how do we determine with any amount of certainty what type of mirror we are looking at? &#13;
<br/><br/>
CONDUCT THIS SIMPLE TEST: Place the tip of your fingernail against the reflective surface and if there is a GAP between your fingernail and the image of the nail, then it is a GENUINE mirror. However, if your fingernail DIRECTLY TOUCHES the image of your nail, then BEWARE, IT IS A 2-WAY MIRROR! (there is someone seeing you from the other side).  The reason there is a gap on a real mirror, is because the silver is on the back of the mirror UNDER the glass. Whereas with a two-way mirror, the silver is on the surface. Keep it in mind! Make sure and check every time you enter in hotel rooms. May be someone is making a film on you.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050827070553/http://www.geocities.com/web_shank/index.html" target="_blank" class="postlink"><span style="font-weight: bold">Plz post only 640x480 ss and add those damn trims to the floor and walls!!!</span></a></span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

<br/><br/>
Maybe you remember way back in school when you learned that the human brain still contains a prehistoric lizard brain at its center. This is the key to understanding women and what you can expect from them.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Women still have direct contact with the lizard brain, something which men have been able to shut down about a trillion centuries ago.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Have you ever noticed how women get cold very easily even if the temperature is only 1 ÂµC below optimum? That's because lizards are cold-blooded, and a woman's lizard brain is telling her that she better get to a warm place quickly or her muscles will freeze up and her heart will stop beating.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Have you noticed how a woman always seems to be thinking about two things at once? That's because a lizard's eyes point in two different directions, so it always has to process two completely different scenes.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Have you noticed how two women can hate each other and have a serious fight, even if they don't know each other and they are sitting on opposite sides of the room? Lizards are very territorial and fight with each other by standing in one place and making threatening movements.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Have you ever noticed how a woman drives? It's that two-direction eye problem again. That's why she thinks that it's possible to drive at high speed on a roundabout while looking in the mirror and adjusting her make-up.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Have you noticed how a woman can sit somewhere completely happy, then suddenly out of nowhere she begins to cut you to pieces with her tongue? Well, just watch a lizard catch flies and you will know where that comes from.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Women can lay in the sun on a big rock all day and never get bored.&#13;
<br/><br/>
If a woman gets the chance, and she thinks that she can get away with it, she will color her hair orange and green and get it styled into a spiky hairdo. This is definitely a lizard haircut.&#13;
<br/><br/>
I'm sure that there are hundreds of examples. The point is, the lizard brain theory explains everything. I am expecting to win the Nobel Prize this year.</td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody"><br/>_________________<br/><a href="/web/20050508074323/http://www.doom3world.org/" target="_blank" class="postlink"><img src="/web/20050508074323im_/http://www.doom3world.org/site/img/d3w.gif" border="0"/> Staff - The world is yours</a></span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

I know what you're thinking: "Anal sex?! Gross! No way!" But it's so cool! My boyfriends get totally turned on by watching me lube up, and I don't worry anymore about getting pregnant. And anal is definitely the fast track to the "in" crowd: Ever since I started taking it anal, I've been way popular at school!&#13;
<br/><br/><br/>
JEREMY T., Holyoke, MA&#13;

I have to admit, when I first suggested anal sex to my girlfriend, she looked at me like I was crazy. I offered to double-wrap, use plenty of AstroGlide, but she was still totally freaked over the idea of it. Then she made a deal with me: If I'd bend over for her strap-on, she'd bend over for me. We take turns taking it up the poop chute, and now we finally feel like our relationship is fully equal.</td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody">&#13;

Hey,&#13;
<br/>
This is a conversation between a father and a son...you will probably understand the reason why US attacked Iraq and how the world functions better after reading&#13;
<br/>
this.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Daddy, why did we have to attack Iraq?&#13;
<br/>
A: Because they had weapons of mass destruction,  honey.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: But the inspectors didn't find any weapons of mass destruction.&#13;
<br/>
A: That's because the Iraqis were hiding them.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: And that's why we invaded Iraq?&#13;
<br/>
A: Yep. Invasions always work better than  inspections.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: But after we invaded them, we STILL didn't find any weapons  of mass destruction, did we?&#13;
<br/>
A: That's because the weapons are so well hidden. Don't worry, we'll find something, probably right before the 2004 election.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Why did Iraq want all those weapons of mass  destruction?&#13;
<br/>
A: To use them in a war, silly.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: I'm confused. If they had all those weapons that they planned to use in a war, then why didn't they use any of those weapons when we  went to war with them?&#13;
<br/>
A: Well, obviously they didn't want anyone to know they had  those weapons,so they chose to die by the thousands rather than defend themselves.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: That doesn't make sense Daddy. Why would they choose to die  if they had all those big weapons to fight us back with?&#13;
<br/>
A: It's a different culture. It's not supposed to make  sense.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: I don't know about you, but I don't think they had any of those weapons our government said they did.&#13;
<br/>
A: Well, you know, it doesn't matter whether or not they had those weapons. We had another good reason to invade them anyway.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: And what was that?&#13;
<br/>
A: Even if Iraq didn't have weapons of mass destruction, Saddam Hussein was a cruel dictator, which is another good reason to invade another country.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Why? What does a cruel dictator do that makes it OK to invade his country?&#13;
<br/>
A: Well, for one thing, he tortured his own people.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Kind of like what they do in China?&#13;
<br/>
A: Don't go comparing China to Iraq. China is a good economic competitor, where millions of people work for slave wages in sweatshops to make U.S. corporations richer.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: So if a country lets its people be exploited for American corporate&#13;
<br/>
gain, it's a good country, even if that country tortures people?&#13;
<br/>
A: Right.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Why were people in Iraq being tortured?&#13;
<br/>
A: For political crimes, mostly, like criticizing the  government. People who criticized the government in Iraq were sent to prison and tortured.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Isn't that exactly what happens in China?&#13;
<br/>
A: I told you, China is different.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: What's the difference between China and Iraq?&#13;
<br/>
A: Well, for one thing, Iraq was ruled by the Ba'ath party, while China is Communist.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Didn't you once tell me Communists were bad?&#13;
<br/>
A: No, just Cuban Communists are bad.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: How are the Cuban Communists bad?&#13;
<br/>
A: Well, for one thing, people who criticize the government in Cuba are sent to prison and tortured.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Like in Iraq?&#13;
<br/>
A: Exactly.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: And like in China, too?&#13;
<br/>
A: I told you, China's a good economic competitor. Cuba, on the other hand, is not.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: How come Cuba isn't a good economic competitor?&#13;
<br/>
A: Well, you see, back in the early 1960s, our government passed some laws that made it illegal for Americans to trade or do any business with Cuba until they stopped being Communists and started being capitalists like us.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: But if we got rid of those laws, opened up trade with Cuba,and started doing business with them, wouldn't that help the Cubans become capitalists?&#13;
<br/>
A: Don't be a smart-ass.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: I didn't think I was being one.&#13;
<br/>
A: Well, anyway, they also don't have freedom of religion in Cuba.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Kind of like China and the @!#$ movement?&#13;
<br/>
A: I told you, stop saying bad things about China. Anyway,  Saddam Hussein came to power through a military coup, so he's not really a legitimate leader anyway.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: What's a military coup?&#13;
<br/>
A: That's when a military general takes over the government of a country by force, instead of holding free elections like we do in the United States.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Didn't the ruler of Pakistan come to power by a military coup?&#13;
<br/>
A: You mean General Pervez Musharraf? Uh, yeah, he did, but Pakistan is our friend.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Why is Pakistan our friend if their leader is illegitimate?&#13;
<br/>
A: I never said Pervez Musharraf was illegitimate.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Didn't you just say a military general who comes to power by forcibly overthrowing the legitimate government of a nation is an illegitimate leader?&#13;
<br/>
A: Only Saddam Hussein. Pervez Musharraf is our friend, because he helped us invade Afghanistan.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Why did we invade Afghanistan?&#13;
<br/>
A: Because of what they did to us on September 11th.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: What did Afghanistan do to us on September 11th?&#13;
<br/>
A: Well, on September 11th, nineteen men, fifteen of them Saudi Arabians, hijacked four airplanes and flew three of them into buildings,killing over 3,000 Americans.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: So how did Afghanistan figure into all that?&#13;
<br/>
A: Afghanistan was where those bad men trained, under the oppressive rule of the Taliban.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Aren't the Taliban those bad radical Islamics who chopped off people's heads and hands?&#13;
<br/>
A: Yes, that's exactly who they were. Not only did they chop off people's heads and hands, but they oppressed women, too.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Didn't the Bush administration giv e the Taliban 43 million dollars back in May of 2001?&#13;
<br/>
A: Yes, but that money was a reward because they did such a good job fighting drugs.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Fighting drugs?&#13;
<br/>
A: Yes, the Taliban were very helpful in stopping people from growing opium poppies.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: How did they do such a good job?&#13;
<br/>
A: Simple. If people were caught growing opium poppies, the Taliban would have their hands and heads cut off.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: So, when the Taliban cut off people's heads and hands for growing flowers, that was OK, but not if they cut people's heads and hands off for other reasons?&#13;
<br/>
A: Yes. It's OK with us if radical Islamic fundamentalists cut off people's hands for growing flowers, but it's cruel if they cut off people's hands for stealing bread.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Don't they also cut off people's hands and heads in Saudi Arabia?&#13;
<br/>
A: That's different. Afghanistan was ruled by a tyrannical patriarchy that oppressed women and forced them to wear burqas whenever they  were in public, with death by stoning as the penalty for women who did not comply.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Don't Saudi women have to wear burqas in public,  too?&#13;
<br/>
A: No, Saudi women merely wear a traditional Islamic body overing.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: What's the difference?&#13;
<br/>
A: The traditional Islamic co! vering worn by Saudi women is a modest yet fashionable garment that covers all of a woman's body xcept for her eyes and fingers. The burqa, on the other hand, is an evil tool of patriarchal oppression that covers all of a woman's body except for her eyes&#13;
<br/>
and fingers.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: It sounds like the same thing with a different  name.&#13;
<br/>
A: Now, don't go comparing Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia. The Saudis are our friends.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: But I thought you said 15 of the 19 hijackers on September 11th were from Saudi Arabia.&#13;
<br/>
A: Yes, but they trained in Afghanistan.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Who trained them?&#13;
<br/>
A: A very bad man named Osama bin Laden.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Was he from Afghanist! an?&#13;
<br/>
A: Uh, no, he was from Saudi Arabia too. But he was a bad man, a very bad man.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: I seem to recall he was our friend once.&#13;
<br/>
A: Only when we helped him and the mujahadeen repel the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan back in the 1980s.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Who are the Soviets? Was that the Evil Communist Empire  Ronald Reagan talked about?&#13;
<br/>
A: There are no more Soviets. The Soviet Union broke up in 1990 or there abouts, and now they have elections and capitalism like us. We call them Russians now.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: So the Soviets, I mean, the Russians, are now our  friends?&#13;
<br/>
A: Well, not really. You see, they were our friends for many years after they stopped being Soviets, bu t then they decided not to support our invasion of Iraq, so we're mad at them now. We're also mad at  the French and the Germans because they didn't help us invade Iraqe ither.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: So the French and Germans are evil, too?&#13;
<br/>
A: Not exactly evil, but just bad enough that we had to rename French fries and French toast to Freedom Fries and Freedom Toast.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Do we always rename foods whenever another country doesn't do what we want them to do?&#13;
<br/>
A: No, we just do that to our friends. Our enemies, we  invade.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: But wasn't Iraq one of our friends back in the  1980s?&#13;
<br/>
A: Well, yeah. For a while.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Was Saddam Hussein ruler of Iraq back then?&#13;
<br/>
A: Yes, but at the time he was fighting against Iran, which made him our friend, temporarily.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Why did that make him our friend?&#13;
<br/>
A: Because at that time, Iran was our enemy.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Isn't that when he gassed the Kurds?&#13;
<br/>
A: Yeah, but since he was fighting against Iran at the time, we looked the other way, to show him we were his friend.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: So anyone who fights against one of our enemies automatically becomes our friend?&#13;
<br/>
A: Most of the time, yes.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: And anyone who fights against one of our friends is automatically an enemy?&#13;
<br/>
A: Sometimes that's true, t! oo. However, if American corporations can profit by selling weapons to both sides at the same time, all  the better.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Why?&#13;
<br/>
A: Because war is good for the economy, which meanswar is good for America. Also, since God is on America's side, anyone who opposes war is  a godless un-American Communist. Do you understand now why we attacked Iraq?&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: I think so. We attacked them because God wanted us to,r ight?&#13;
<br/>
A: Yes.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: But how did we know God wanted us to attack Iraq?&#13;
<br/>
A: Well, you see, God personally speaks to George W. Bush and tells him what to do.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: So basically, what you're saying is that we attacked Iraq because George W. Bush hears voices in his head?&#13;
<br/>
A. Yes! You finally understand how the world works. Now close your eyes, make yourself comfortable, and go to sleep. Good night.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Good night, Daddy.&#13;

It is Very difficult to positively identify the surface by just looking at it. So, how do we determine with any amount of certainty what type of mirror we are looking at? &#13;
<br/><br/>
CONDUCT THIS SIMPLE TEST: Place the tip of your fingernail against the reflective surface and if there is a GAP between your fingernail and the image of the nail, then it is a GENUINE mirror. However, if your fingernail DIRECTLY TOUCHES the image of your nail, then BEWARE, IT IS A 2-WAY MIRROR! (there is someone seeing you from the other side).  The reason there is a gap on a real mirror, is because the silver is on the back of the mirror UNDER the glass. Whereas with a two-way mirror, the silver is on the surface. Keep it in mind! Make sure and check every time you enter in hotel rooms. May be someone is making a film on you.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="/web/20050508074323/http://www.geocities.com/web_shank/index.html" target="_blank" class="postlink"><span style="font-weight: bold">Plz post only 640x480 ss and add those damn trims to the floor and walls!!!</span></a></span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

<br/><br/>
Maybe you remember way back in school when you learned that the human brain still contains a prehistoric lizard brain at its center. This is the key to understanding women and what you can expect from them.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Women still have direct contact with the lizard brain, something which men have been able to shut down about a trillion centuries ago.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Have you ever noticed how women get cold very easily even if the temperature is only 1 ÂµC below optimum? That's because lizards are cold-blooded, and a woman's lizard brain is telling her that she better get to a warm place quickly or her muscles will freeze up and her heart will stop beating.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Have you noticed how a woman always seems to be thinking about two things at once? That's because a lizard's eyes point in two different directions, so it always has to process two completely different scenes.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Have you noticed how two women can hate each other and have a serious fight, even if they don't know each other and they are sitting on opposite sides of the room? Lizards are very territorial and fight with each other by standing in one place and making threatening movements.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Have you ever noticed how a woman drives? It's that two-direction eye problem again. That's why she thinks that it's possible to drive at high speed on a roundabout while looking in the mirror and adjusting her make-up.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Have you noticed how a woman can sit somewhere completely happy, then suddenly out of nowhere she begins to cut you to pieces with her tongue? Well, just watch a lizard catch flies and you will know where that comes from.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Women can lay in the sun on a big rock all day and never get bored.&#13;
<br/><br/>
If a woman gets the chance, and she thinks that she can get away with it, she will color her hair orange and green and get it styled into a spiky hairdo. This is definitely a lizard haircut.&#13;
<br/><br/>
I'm sure that there are hundreds of examples. The point is, the lizard brain theory explains everything. I am expecting to win the Nobel Prize this year.</td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody"><br/>_________________<br/><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050508074323/http://www.doom3world.org/" target="_blank" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20050508074323im_/http://www.doom3world.org/site/img/d3w.gif" border="0"/> Staff - The world is yours</a></span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

I know what you're thinking: "Anal sex?! Gross! No way!" But it's so cool! My boyfriends get totally turned on by watching me lube up, and I don't worry anymore about getting pregnant. And anal is definitely the fast track to the "in" crowd: Ever since I started taking it anal, I've been way popular at school!&#13;
<br/><br/><br/>
JEREMY T., Holyoke, MA&#13;
<br/>
I have to admit, when I first suggested anal sex to my girlfriend, she looked at me like I was crazy. I offered to double-wrap, use plenty of AstroGlide, but she was still totally freaked over the idea of it. Then she made a deal with me: If I'd bend over for her strap-on, she'd bend over for me.

Hey,&#13;
<br/>
This is a conversation between a father and a son...you will probably understand the reason why US attacked Iraq and how the world functions better after reading&#13;
<br/>
this.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Daddy, why did we have to attack Iraq?&#13;
<br/>
A: Because they had weapons of mass destruction,  honey.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: But the inspectors didn't find any weapons of mass destruction.&#13;
<br/>
A: That's because the Iraqis were hiding them.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: And that's why we invaded Iraq?&#13;
<br/>
A: Yep. Invasions always work better than  inspections.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: But after we invaded them, we STILL didn't find any weapons  of mass destruction, did we?&#13;
<br/>
A: That's because the weapons are so well hidden. Don't worry, we'll find something, probably right before the 2004 election.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Why did Iraq want all those weapons of mass  destruction?&#13;
<br/>
A: To use them in a war, silly.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: I'm confused. If they had all those weapons that they planned to use in a war, then why didn't they use any of those weapons when we  went to war with them?&#13;
<br/>
A: Well, obviously they didn't want anyone to know they had  those weapons,so they chose to die by the thousands rather than defend themselves.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: That doesn't make sense Daddy. Why would they choose to die  if they had all those big weapons to fight us back with?&#13;
<br/>
A: It's a different culture. It's not supposed to make  sense.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: I don't know about you, but I don't think they had any of those weapons our government said they did.&#13;
<br/>
A: Well, you know, it doesn't matter whether or not they had those weapons. We had another good reason to invade them anyway.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: And what was that?&#13;
<br/>
A: Even if Iraq didn't have weapons of mass destruction, Saddam Hussein was a cruel dictator, which is another good reason to invade another country.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Why? What does a cruel dictator do that makes it OK to invade his country?&#13;
<br/>
A: Well, for one thing, he tortured his own people.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Kind of like what they do in China?&#13;
<br/>
A: Don't go comparing China to Iraq. China is a good economic competitor, where millions of people work for slave wages in sweatshops to make U.S. corporations richer.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: So if a country lets its people be exploited for American corporate&#13;
<br/>
gain, it's a good country, even if that country tortures people?&#13;
<br/>
A: Right.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Why were people in Iraq being tortured?&#13;
<br/>
A: For political crimes, mostly, like criticizing the  government. People who criticized the government in Iraq were sent to prison and tortured.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Isn't that exactly what happens in China?&#13;
<br/>
A: I told you, China is different.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: What's the difference between China and Iraq?&#13;
<br/>
A: Well, for one thing, Iraq was ruled by the Ba'ath party, while China is Communist.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Didn't you once tell me Communists were bad?&#13;
<br/>
A: No, just Cuban Communists are bad.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: How are the Cuban Communists bad?&#13;
<br/>
A: Well, for one thing, people who criticize the government in Cuba are sent to prison and tortured.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Like in Iraq?&#13;
<br/>
A: Exactly.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: And like in China, too?&#13;
<br/>
A: I told you, China's a good economic competitor. Cuba, on the other hand, is not.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: How come Cuba isn't a good economic competitor?&#13;
<br/>
A: Well, you see, back in the early 1960s, our government passed some laws that made it illegal for Americans to trade or do any business with Cuba until they stopped being Communists and started being capitalists like us.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: But if we got rid of those laws, opened up trade with Cuba,and started doing business with them, wouldn't that help the Cubans become capitalists?&#13;
<br/>
A: Don't be a smart-ass.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: I didn't think I was being one.&#13;
<br/>
A: Well, anyway, they also don't have freedom of religion in Cuba.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Kind of like China and the @!#$ movement?&#13;
<br/>
A: I told you, stop saying bad things about China. Anyway,  Saddam Hussein came to power through a military coup, so he's not really a legitimate leader anyway.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: What's a military coup?&#13;
<br/>
A: That's when a military general takes over the government of a country by force, instead of holding free elections like we do in the United States.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Didn't the ruler of Pakistan come to power by a military coup?&#13;
<br/>
A: You mean General Pervez Musharraf? Uh, yeah, he did, but Pakistan is our friend.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Why is Pakistan our friend if their leader is illegitimate?&#13;
<br/>
A: I never said Pervez Musharraf was illegitimate.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Didn't you just say a military general who comes to power by forcibly overthrowing the legitimate government of a nation is an illegitimate leader?&#13;
<br/>
A: Only Saddam Hussein. Pervez Musharraf is our friend, because he helped us invade Afghanistan.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Why did we invade Afghanistan?&#13;
<br/>
A: Because of what they did to us on September 11th.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: What did Afghanistan do to us on September 11th?&#13;
<br/>
A: Well, on September 11th, nineteen men, fifteen of them Saudi Arabians, hijacked four airplanes and flew three of them into buildings,killing over 3,000 Americans.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: So how did Afghanistan figure into all that?&#13;
<br/>
A: Afghanistan was where those bad men trained, under the oppressive rule of the Taliban.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Aren't the Taliban those bad radical Islamics who chopped off people's heads and hands?&#13;
<br/>
A: Yes, that's exactly who they were. Not only did they chop off people's heads and hands, but they oppressed women, too.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Didn't the Bush administration giv e the Taliban 43 million dollars back in May of 2001?&#13;
<br/>
A: Yes, but that money was a reward because they did such a good job fighting drugs.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Fighting drugs?&#13;
<br/>
A: Yes, the Taliban were very helpful in stopping people from growing opium poppies.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: How did they do such a good job?&#13;
<br/>
A: Simple. If people were caught growing opium poppies, the Taliban would have their hands and heads cut off.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: So, when the Taliban cut off people's heads and hands for growing flowers, that was OK, but not if they cut people's heads and hands off for other reasons?&#13;
<br/>
A: Yes. It's OK with us if radical Islamic fundamentalists cut off people's hands for growing flowers, but it's cruel if they cut off people's hands for stealing bread.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Don't they also cut off people's hands and heads in Saudi Arabia?&#13;
<br/>
A: That's different. Afghanistan was ruled by a tyrannical patriarchy that oppressed women and forced them to wear burqas whenever they  were in public, with death by stoning as the penalty for women who did not comply.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Don't Saudi women have to wear burqas in public,  too?&#13;
<br/>
A: No, Saudi women merely wear a traditional Islamic body overing.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: What's the difference?&#13;
<br/>
A: The traditional Islamic co! vering worn by Saudi women is a modest yet fashionable garment that covers all of a woman's body xcept for her eyes and fingers. The burqa, on the other hand, is an evil tool of patriarchal oppression that covers all of a woman's body except for her eyes&#13;
<br/>
and fingers.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: It sounds like the same thing with a different  name.&#13;
<br/>
A: Now, don't go comparing Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia. The Saudis are our friends.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: But I thought you said 15 of the 19 hijackers on September 11th were from Saudi Arabia.&#13;
<br/>
A: Yes, but they trained in Afghanistan.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Who trained them?&#13;
<br/>
A: A very bad man named Osama bin Laden.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Was he from Afghanist! an?&#13;
<br/>
A: Uh, no, he was from Saudi Arabia too. But he was a bad man, a very bad man.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: I seem to recall he was our friend once.&#13;
<br/>
A: Only when we helped him and the mujahadeen repel the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan back in the 1980s.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Who are the Soviets? Was that the Evil Communist Empire  Ronald Reagan talked about?&#13;
<br/>
A: There are no more Soviets. The Soviet Union broke up in 1990 or there abouts, and now they have elections and capitalism like us. We call them Russians now.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: So the Soviets, I mean, the Russians, are now our  friends?&#13;
<br/>
A: Well, not really. You see, they were our friends for many years after they stopped being Soviets, bu t then they decided not to support our invasion of Iraq, so we're mad at them now. We're also mad at  the French and the Germans because they didn't help us invade Iraqe ither.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: So the French and Germans are evil, too?&#13;
<br/>
A: Not exactly evil, but just bad enough that we had to rename French fries and French toast to Freedom Fries and Freedom Toast.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Do we always rename foods whenever another country doesn't do what we want them to do?&#13;
<br/>
A: No, we just do that to our friends. Our enemies, we  invade.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: But wasn't Iraq one of our friends back in the  1980s?&#13;
<br/>
A: Well, yeah. For a while.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Was Saddam Hussein ruler of Iraq back then?&#13;
<br/>
A: Yes, but at the time he was fighting against Iran, which made him our friend, temporarily.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Why did that make him our friend?&#13;
<br/>
A: Because at that time, Iran was our enemy.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Isn't that when he gassed the Kurds?&#13;
<br/>
A: Yeah, but since he was fighting against Iran at the time, we looked the other way, to show him we were his friend.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: So anyone who fights against one of our enemies automatically becomes our friend?&#13;
<br/>
A: Most of the time, yes.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: And anyone who fights against one of our friends is automatically an enemy?&#13;
<br/>
A: Sometimes that's true, t! oo. However, if American corporations can profit by selling weapons to both sides at the same time, all  the better.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: Why?&#13;
<br/>
A: Because war is good for the economy, which meanswar is good for America. Also, since God is on America's side, anyone who opposes war is  a godless un-American Communist. Do you understand now why we attacked Iraq?&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: I think so. We attacked them because God wanted us to,r ight?&#13;
<br/>
A: Yes.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: But how did we know God wanted us to attack Iraq?&#13;
<br/>
A: Well, you see, God personally speaks to George W. Bush and tells him what to do.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Q: So basically, what you're saying is that we attacked Iraq because George W. Bush hears voices in his head?&#13;
<br/>
A. Yes! You finally understand how the world works. Now close your eyes, make yourself comfortable, and go to sleep. Good night.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Good night, Daddy.&#13;

It is Very difficult to positively identify the surface by just looking at it. So, how do we determine with any amount of certainty what type of mirror we are looking at? &#13;
<br/><br/>
CONDUCT THIS SIMPLE TEST: Place the tip of your fingernail against the reflective surface and if there is a GAP between your fingernail and the image of the nail, then it is a GENUINE mirror. However, if your fingernail DIRECTLY TOUCHES the image of your nail, then BEWARE, IT IS A 2-WAY MIRROR! (there is someone seeing you from the other side).  The reason there is a gap on a real mirror, is because the silver is on the back of the mirror UNDER the glass. Whereas with a two-way mirror, the silver is on the surface. Keep it in mind! Make sure and check every time you enter in hotel rooms. May be someone is making a film on you.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050508074323/http://www.geocities.com/web_shank/index.html" target="_blank" class="postlink"><span style="font-weight: bold">Plz post only 640x480 ss and add those damn trims to the floor and walls!!!</span></a></span><span class="gensmall"/></td>
