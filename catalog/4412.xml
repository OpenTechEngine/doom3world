Most of the tutorials were uploaded in 2004 and are more than likely to be offline now.
<br /><br />Your best bet at figuring out how to use different elements is to load up the retail doom3 maps and pick them apart.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p177159" date="Posted: Tue May 01, 2007 12:15 am "><author>Kristus</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Not that you really need any tutorial to make a ladder anyway.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p177218" date="Posted: Tue May 01, 2007 3:49 pm "><author>hardcore_gamer</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">by the way, how do you create a ladder that allows you to climp up?

<br />I never figured out why Id software didn't take the time to think about ladder-climbing animations and intricate gameplay mechanics of shooting when only having one hand to hold the gun.
<br />It's not in ETQW either <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20091206232229im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p177224" date="Posted: Tue May 01, 2007 4:56 pm "><author>irishlostboy1980</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">i would say TIME is the reason itself. wouldn't you? and also the fact that nowhere in the single player game is it needed. haven't played doom3 multiplayer, where i am guessing it would be more needed.
<br />the animation bit isn't that hard. just whip your model into 3ds max and do it. the scripting it in and triggering it  is another story.
<br />i remember seeingsomeone working on the ladder animation i the modelling and animation section a long time ago. dunno if it was finished or not though.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p178138" date="Posted: Mon May 14, 2007 3:55 pm "><author>obsrv</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">link doesn't work is there a new one?</div>]]></body></post></posts></thread></xml>
