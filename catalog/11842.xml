Answer: with a lot of code and a compiler.&#13;
<br/><br/>
The rendering engine is a lot more impressive than the level editor.&#13;

I suggest you hold out on buying lightwave... &#13;

btw - modelling characters and their animation is different than modelling levels and props ... they use Maya for one and Lightwave for the other.&#13;

Plus, they're halving the price to $700 for the entire package of modeler and layout (and you'll be able to model directly in layout) - that will  definitely be the most powerful and cheapest 3d software you'll be able to buy. &#13;
<br/>
 Newtek have pulled a great new team together, after the luxology traitors deserted,  are completely rewriting lightwave from the ground up, and they're finially starting to make some long awaited changes. I'm glad I stuck with it, though the real reason is that I've never found another modeler to match up to lightwave's speed and intuitive nature.&#13;
<br/>
  Silo - yes it's a great little app, heavily influenced by lightwave modeler and a liitle by maya, and only about $100. I'd probably use it myself if I was just starting out, but I can work so perfectly in lightwave now, I don't want to change, and it has some features missing that lightwave doesn't have, plus I can't stand manipulator handles. Lightwave's mouse modes and drag tool are far superior.</td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody">&#13;

Do not listen to this guy by any means!&#13;

Only a poor craftsman blames his tools. LightWave is known to be a very very powerful modelling program, often used in combination with MAYA.&#13;

If LightWave would be only half as bad as this guy tries to make you believe then not half the industry would use it for modelling purposes.&#13;

Go to the product websites, and you'll see this.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Ok, so besides the basic capabilities, there are 2 issues at hand when considering a new modeling package: interface, and documentation.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Again, most packages are going to be well documented, but the older ones are going to have more. So something like silo or modo might be great, but you're going to find more studio max tutorials. Alias puts out awesome learning tools, but they ain't free.&#13;
<br/><br/>
That leaves interface, and that's big. And it's very subjective. You just gotta try 'em all out, and see what sticks. Personally, I dig maya, because its structure makes my inner unix geek happy. Other people dig lw and max, and that's their thing.</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

Plus, they're halving the price to $700 for the entire package of modeler and layout (and you'll be able to model directly in layout) - that will  definitely be the most powerful and cheapest 3d software you'll be able to buy. &#13;
<br/>
 Newtek have pulled a great new team together, after the luxology traitors deserted,  are completely rewriting lightwave from the ground up, and they're finially starting to make some long awaited changes. I'm glad I stuck with it, though the real reason is that I've never found another modeler to match up to lightwave's speed and intuitive nature.&#13;
<br/>
  Silo - yes it's a great little app, heavily influenced by lightwave modeler and a liitle by maya, and only about $100. I'd probably use it myself if I was just starting out, but I can work so perfectly in lightwave now, I don't want to change, and it has some features missing that lightwave doesn't have, plus I can't stand manipulator handles. Lightwave's mouse modes and drag tool are far superior.<br/>_________________<br/>Civillisation will not attain perfection until the last stone, from the last church, falls on the last priest.&#13;

Hmm. Even now the question is hard to understand.&#13;

Well, let me toy with readability for a bit. How's this...&#13;

"What I want to know is, how can they make an editor?"&#13;

Now it makes sense but I'm still not sure who your talking about (who is they?), and what you mean by editor.&#13;
<br/><br/>
And that's where the problem comes into play. It's not about spelling or grammar. I make spelling mistakes all the time. It's about being clear.&#13;
<br/><br/>
I can spend a good 30+ minutes trying to guess what you meant but I shouldn't have to.

It's a shame really as the biggest factor when it comes to choosing which package to go with is how intuitive the interface is to you.&#13;

  Silo - yes it's a great little app, heavily influenced by lightwave modeler and a liitle by maya, and only about $100. I'd probably use it myself if I was just starting out, but I can work so perfectly in lightwave now, I don't want to change, and it has some features missing that lightwave doesn't have, plus I can't stand manipulator handles.

Now it makes sense but I'm still not sure who your talking about (who is they?), and what you mean by editor.&#13;

And that's where the problem comes into play. It's not about spelling or grammar. I make spelling mistakes all the time. It's about being clear.&#13;

I'd probably use it myself if I was just starting out, but I can work so perfectly in lightwave now, I don't want to change, and it has some features missing that lightwave doesn't have, plus I can't stand manipulator handles. Lightwave's mouse modes and drag tool are far superior.</td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody">&#13;

Do not listen to this guy by any means!&#13;
<br/><br/>
Only a poor craftsman blames his tools. LightWave is known to be a very very powerful modelling program, often used in combination with MAYA.&#13;
<br/><br/>
If LightWave would be only half as bad as this guy tries to make you believe then not half the industry would use it for modelling purposes.&#13;

Ok, so besides the basic capabilities, there are 2 issues at hand when considering a new modeling package: interface, and documentation.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Again, most packages are going to be well documented, but the older ones are going to have more. So something like silo or modo might be great, but you're going to find more studio max tutorials. Alias puts out awesome learning tools, but they ain't free.&#13;
<br/><br/>
That leaves interface, and that's big. And it's very subjective. You just gotta try 'em all out, and see what sticks. Personally, I dig maya, because its structure makes my inner unix geek happy. Other people dig lw and max, and that's their thing.</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

Plus, they're halving the price to $700 for the entire package of modeler and layout (and you'll be able to model directly in layout) - that will  definitely be the most powerful and cheapest 3d software you'll be able to buy.

Go to the product websites, and you'll see this.
<br /><br />Ok, so besides the basic capabilities, there are 2 issues at hand when considering a new modeling package: interface, and documentation.
<br /><br />Again, most packages are going to be well documented, but the older ones are going to have more. So something like silo or modo might be great, but you're going to find more studio max tutorials. Alias puts out awesome learning tools, but they ain't free.
<br /><br />That leaves interface, and that's big. And it's very subjective. You just gotta try 'em all out, and see what sticks. Personally, I dig maya, because its structure makes my inner unix geek happy. Other people dig lw and max, and that's their thing.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p118377" date="Posted: Wed Oct 26, 2005 8:22 pm "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">fleabay wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">oDDity wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">fleabay - show us some of this great modeling you've done in these other apps, or shut the fuck up.<br /> You won't of course, because you're just a stupid troll with no talent who knows as much about CG as my right testicle.</div><br /><br />"-Max = I can't stand this app, and would rather kill my own grandnother and then rape her dead mouth than use it." -oDDity<br /><br />I am sure I quoted you correctly on this.

Go to the product websites, and you'll see this.
<br /><br />Ok, so besides the basic capabilities, there are 2 issues at hand when considering a new modeling package: interface, and documentation.
<br /><br />Again, most packages are going to be well documented, but the older ones are going to have more. So something like silo or modo might be great, but you're going to find more studio max tutorials. Alias puts out awesome learning tools, but they ain't free.
<br /><br />That leaves interface, and that's big. And it's very subjective. You just gotta try 'em all out, and see what sticks. Personally, I dig maya, because its structure makes my inner unix geek happy.

<br /><br />I could you tell the same about max, but i don't tell it....why ? well for me is the UI of max just terrible, and its workflow doesen't work for <span style="font-weight: bold">me</span>, but only me, so i would not come here to say max ist a piece of shit....
<br /><br />It just does not fit to me, simple as it is.
<br /><br /><br /><br />i work with XSI and Lightwave and Zbrush2 what i want more...hehe

Go to the product websites, and you'll see this.
<br /><br />Ok, so besides the basic capabilities, there are 2 issues at hand when considering a new modeling package: interface, and documentation.
<br /><br />Again, most packages are going to be well documented, but the older ones are going to have more. So something like silo or modo might be great, but you're going to find more studio max tutorials. Alias puts out awesome learning tools, but they ain't free.
<br /><br />That leaves interface, and that's big. And it's very subjective. You just gotta try 'em all out, and see what sticks. Personally, I dig maya, because its structure makes my inner unix geek happy. Other people dig lw and max, and that's their thing.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p118377" date="Posted: Wed Oct 26, 2005 8:22 pm "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">fleabay wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">oDDity wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">fleabay - show us some of this great modeling you've done in these other apps, or shut the fuck up.<br /> You won't of course, because you're just a stupid troll with no talent who knows as much about CG as my right testicle.</div><br /><br />"-Max = I can't stand this app, and would rather kill my own grandnother and then rape her dead mouth than use it." -oDDity<br /><br />I am sure I quoted you correctly on this.

Go to the product websites, and you'll see this.
<br /><br />Ok, so besides the basic capabilities, there are 2 issues at hand when considering a new modeling package: interface, and documentation.
<br /><br />Again, most packages are going to be well documented, but the older ones are going to have more. So something like silo or modo might be great, but you're going to find more studio max tutorials. Alias puts out awesome learning tools, but they ain't free.
<br /><br />That leaves interface, and that's big. And it's very subjective. You just gotta try 'em all out, and see what sticks.

Lightwave's mouse modes and drag tool are far superior.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107480" date="Posted: Tue Aug 09, 2005 4:45 pm "><author>ajm113</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Yes you are right BNA it does say that they used maya for animating characters in maya.

<br /><br />You want to know what?
<br /><br />Kid, please stop bugging us with such sentences - can't be that a lot of people have to constantly spend time only to find out what you want since you're too lazy to watch your typing.

<br /><br />Here is the question that BNA was responding to...
<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">I whant to know is how can they make a editor?</div>
<br /><br />Now, I'll fix the spelling ...
<br /><br />"I want to know is how can they make a editor?"
<br /><br />Hmm. Even now the question is hard to understand.
<br /><br />Well, let me toy with readability for a bit. How's this...
<br /><br />"What I want to know is, how can they make an editor?"
<br /><br />Now it makes sense but I'm still not sure who your talking about (who is they?), and what you mean by editor.
<br /><br />And that's where the problem comes into play. It's not about spelling or grammar. I make spelling mistakes all the time. It's about being clear.
<br /><br />I can spend a good 30+ minutes trying to guess what you meant but I shouldn't have to. You should have made a concious effort to make your question understood from the get go.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107666" date="Posted: Wed Aug 10, 2005 9:12 pm "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">ajm113 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I was just asking you dont need to be a ahole about it.  </div>
<br /><br />I'm not "ahole" - do I take your reply in a way that you desire to post elsewhere in the future?
<br /><br />I don't care how many idiots are older than you and still don't try to spell.
<br /><br />Like I said - if English is your second language or if you're handicapped shoot me a pm and all is fine.
<br /><br />If not, then better get in gear with spelling yesterday.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107763" date="FIXME failed to extract"><author>oDDity</author><body><![CDATA[<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>

						<div class="postbody">Lightwave is a very good program but then again it really doesn't matter what modeling application you go for as they all are capable of the same thing.
<br /><br />Unfortunately, there isn't a downloadable demo that I'm aware of.
<br /><br />It's a shame really as the biggest factor when it comes to choosing which package to go with is how intuitive the interface is to you.
<br /><br />Anyway, if you do decide on getting the program don't buy it new. It's far too expensive that way. Go buy a used copy off ebay.
<br /><br />I also suggest you give Blender a try before you settle on a commercial package as Blender is free.</div>

Plus, they're halving the price to $700 for the entire package of modeler and layout (and you'll be able to model directly in layout) - that will  definitely be the most powerful and cheapest 3d software you'll be able to buy. 
<br /> Newtek have pulled a great new team together, after the luxology traitors deserted,  are completely rewriting lightwave from the ground up, and they're finially starting to make some long awaited changes. I'm glad I stuck with it, though the real reason is that I've never found another modeler to match up to lightwave's speed and intuitive nature.
<br />  Silo - yes it's a great little app, heavily influenced by lightwave modeler and a liitle by maya, and only about $100. I'd probably use it myself if I was just starting out, but I can work so perfectly in lightwave now, I don't want to change, and it has some features missing that lightwave doesn't have, plus I can't stand manipulator handles. Lightwave's mouse modes and drag tool are far superior.</div>

Plus, they're halving the price to $700 for the entire package of modeler and layout (and you'll be able to model directly in layout) - that will  definitely be the most powerful and cheapest 3d software you'll be able to buy. 
<br /> Newtek have pulled a great new team together, after the luxology traitors deserted,  are completely rewriting lightwave from the ground up, and they're finially starting to make some long awaited changes. I'm glad I stuck with it, though the real reason is that I've never found another modeler to match up to lightwave's speed and intuitive nature.
<br />  Silo - yes it's a great little app, heavily influenced by lightwave modeler and a liitle by maya, and only about $100. I'd probably use it myself if I was just starting out, but I can work so perfectly in lightwave now, I don't want to change, and it has some features missing that lightwave doesn't have, plus I can't stand manipulator handles. Lightwave's mouse modes and drag tool are far superior.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107480" date="Posted: Tue Aug 09, 2005 4:45 pm "><author>ajm113</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Yes you are right BNA it does say that they used maya for animating characters in maya.

<br /><br />Now, I'll fix the spelling ...
<br /><br />"I want to know is how can they make a editor?"
<br /><br />Hmm. Even now the question is hard to understand.
<br /><br />Well, let me toy with readability for a bit. How's this...
<br /><br />"What I want to know is, how can they make an editor?"
<br /><br />Now it makes sense but I'm still not sure who your talking about (who is they?), and what you mean by editor.
<br /><br />And that's where the problem comes into play. It's not about spelling or grammar. I make spelling mistakes all the time. It's about being clear.
<br /><br />I can spend a good 30+ minutes trying to guess what you meant but I shouldn't have to. You should have made a concious effort to make your question understood from the get go.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p107666" date="Posted: Wed Aug 10, 2005 9:12 pm "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">ajm113 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I was just asking you dont need to be a ahole about it.  </div>

Plus, they're halving the price to $700 for the entire package of modeler and layout (and you'll be able to model directly in layout) - that will  definitely be the most powerful and cheapest 3d software you'll be able to buy. 
<br /> Newtek have pulled a great new team together, after the luxology traitors deserted,  are completely rewriting lightwave from the ground up, and they're finially starting to make some long awaited changes. I'm glad I stuck with it, though the real reason is that I've never found another modeler to match up to lightwave's speed and intuitive nature.
<br />  Silo - yes it's a great little app, heavily influenced by lightwave modeler and a liitle by maya, and only about $100. I'd probably use it myself if I was just starting out, but I can work so perfectly in lightwave now, I don't want to change, and it has some features missing that lightwave doesn't have, plus I can't stand manipulator handles.

<br /><br />Now it makes sense but I'm still not sure who your talking about (who is they?), and what you mean by editor.

						<div class="postbody">Lightwave is a very good program but then again it really doesn't matter what modeling application you go for as they all are capable of the same thing.&#13;<br /><br />Unfortunately, there isn't a downloadable demo that I'm aware of.&#13;<br /><br />It's a shame really as the biggest factor when it comes to choosing which package to go with is how intuitive the interface is to you.&#13;<br /><br />Anyway, if you do decide on getting the program don't buy it new. It's far too expensive that way. Go buy a used copy off ebay.&#13;<br /><br />I also suggest you give Blender a try before you settle on a commercial package as Blender is free.</div>

Plus, they're halving the price to $700 for the entire package of modeler and layout (and you'll be able to model directly in layout) - that will  definitely be the most powerful and cheapest 3d software you'll be able to buy. &#13;<br /> Newtek have pulled a great new team together, after the luxology traitors deserted,  are completely rewriting lightwave from the ground up, and they're finially starting to make some long awaited changes. I'm glad I stuck with it, though the real reason is that I've never found another modeler to match up to lightwave's speed and intuitive nature.&#13;<br />  Silo - yes it's a great little app, heavily influenced by lightwave modeler and a liitle by maya, and only about $100. I'd probably use it myself if I was just starting out, but I can work so perfectly in lightwave now, I don't want to change, and it has some features missing that lightwave doesn't have, plus I can't stand manipulator handles. Lightwave's mouse modes and drag tool are far superior.</div>

Plus, they're halving the price to $700 for the entire package of modeler and layout (and you'll be able to model directly in layout) - that will  definitely be the most powerful and cheapest 3d software you'll be able to buy. &#13;<br /> Newtek have pulled a great new team together, after the luxology traitors deserted,  are completely rewriting lightwave from the ground up, and they're finially starting to make some long awaited changes. I'm glad I stuck with it, though the real reason is that I've never found another modeler to match up to lightwave's speed and intuitive nature.&#13;<br />  Silo - yes it's a great little app, heavily influenced by lightwave modeler and a liitle by maya, and only about $100. I'd probably use it myself if I was just starting out, but I can work so perfectly in lightwave now, I don't want to change, and it has some features missing that lightwave doesn't have, plus I can't stand manipulator handles.

						<div class="postbody">Lightwave is a very good program but then again it really doesn't matter what modeling application you go for as they all are capable of the same thing.&#13;<br /><br />Unfortunately, there isn't a downloadable demo that I'm aware of.&#13;<br /><br />It's a shame really as the biggest factor when it comes to choosing which package to go with is how intuitive the interface is to you.&#13;<br /><br />Anyway, if you do decide on getting the program don't buy it new. It's far too expensive that way. Go buy a used copy off ebay.&#13;<br /><br />I also suggest you give Blender a try before you settle on a commercial package as Blender is free.</div>

Plus, they're halving the price to $700 for the entire package of modeler and layout (and you'll be able to model directly in layout) - that will  definitely be the most powerful and cheapest 3d software you'll be able to buy. &#13;<br /> Newtek have pulled a great new team together, after the luxology traitors deserted,  are completely rewriting lightwave from the ground up, and they're finially starting to make some long awaited changes. I'm glad I stuck with it, though the real reason is that I've never found another modeler to match up to lightwave's speed and intuitive nature.&#13;<br />  Silo - yes it's a great little app, heavily influenced by lightwave modeler and a liitle by maya, and only about $100. I'd probably use it myself if I was just starting out, but I can work so perfectly in lightwave now, I don't want to change, and it has some features missing that lightwave doesn't have, plus I can't stand manipulator handles. Lightwave's mouse modes and drag tool are far superior.</div>

It's far too expensive that way.

Plus, they're halving the price to $700 for the entire package of modeler and layout (and you'll be able to model directly in layout) - that will  definitely be the most powerful and cheapest 3d software you'll be able to buy. &#13;<br /> Newtek have pulled a great new team together, after the luxology traitors deserted,  are completely rewriting lightwave from the ground up, and they're finially starting to make some long awaited changes. I'm glad I stuck with it, though the real reason is that I've never found another modeler to match up to lightwave's speed and intuitive nature.&#13;<br />  Silo - yes it's a great little app, heavily influenced by lightwave modeler and a liitle by maya, and only about $100. I'd probably use it myself if I was just starting out, but I can work so perfectly in lightwave now, I don't want to change, and it has some features missing that lightwave doesn't have, plus I can't stand manipulator handles.

						<div class="postbody">Lightwave is a very good program but then again it really doesn't matter what modeling application you go for as they all are capable of the same thing.&#13;<br /><br />Unfortunately, there isn't a downloadable demo that I'm aware of.&#13;<br /><br />It's a shame really as the biggest factor when it comes to choosing which package to go with is how intuitive the interface is to you.&#13;<br /><br />Anyway, if you do decide on getting the program don't buy it new. It's far too expensive that way. Go buy a used copy off ebay.&#13;<br /><br />I also suggest you give Blender a try before you settle on a commercial package as Blender is free.</div>

Plus, they're halving the price to $700 for the entire package of modeler and layout (and you'll be able to model directly in layout) - that will  definitely be the most powerful and cheapest 3d software you'll be able to buy. &#13;<br /> Newtek have pulled a great new team together, after the luxology traitors deserted,  are completely rewriting lightwave from the ground up, and they're finially starting to make some long awaited changes. I'm glad I stuck with it, though the real reason is that I've never found another modeler to match up to lightwave's speed and intuitive nature.&#13;<br />  Silo - yes it's a great little app, heavily influenced by lightwave modeler and a liitle by maya, and only about $100. I'd probably use it myself if I was just starting out, but I can work so perfectly in lightwave now, I don't want to change, and it has some features missing that lightwave doesn't have, plus I can't stand manipulator handles. Lightwave's mouse modes and drag tool are far superior.</div>

<br /><br />The rendering engine is a lot more impressive than the level editor.

Go to the product websites, and you'll see this.
<br /><br />Ok, so besides the basic capabilities, there are 2 issues at hand when considering a new modeling package: interface, and documentation.
<br /><br />Again, most packages are going to be well documented, but the older ones are going to have more. So something like silo or modo might be great, but you're going to find more studio max tutorials. Alias puts out awesome learning tools, but they ain't free.
<br /><br />That leaves interface, and that's big. And it's very subjective. You just gotta try 'em all out, and see what sticks. Personally, I dig maya, because its structure makes my inner unix geek happy.

Plus, they're halving the price to $700 for the entire package of modeler and layout (and you'll be able to model directly in layout) - that will  definitely be the most powerful and cheapest 3d software you'll be able to buy. &#13;
<br/>
 Newtek have pulled a great new team together, after the luxology traitors deserted,  are completely rewriting lightwave from the ground up, and they're finially starting to make some long awaited changes. I'm glad I stuck with it, though the real reason is that I've never found another modeler to match up to lightwave's speed and intuitive nature.&#13;
<br/>
  Silo - yes it's a great little app, heavily influenced by lightwave modeler and a liitle by maya, and only about $100. I'd probably use it myself if I was just starting out, but I can work so perfectly in lightwave now, I don't want to change, and it has some features missing that lightwave doesn't have, plus I can't stand manipulator handles.

Only a poor craftsman blames his tools. LightWave is known to be a very very powerful modelling program, often used in combination with MAYA.&#13;

<br/>
 Newtek have pulled a great new team together, after the luxology traitors deserted,  are completely rewriting lightwave from the ground up, and they're finially starting to make some long awaited changes. I'm glad I stuck with it, though the real reason is that I've never found another modeler to match up to lightwave's speed and intuitive nature.&#13;
<br/>
  Silo - yes it's a great little app, heavily influenced by lightwave modeler and a liitle by maya, and only about $100. I'd probably use it myself if I was just starting out, but I can work so perfectly in lightwave now, I don't want to change, and it has some features missing that lightwave doesn't have, plus I can't stand manipulator handles. Lightwave's mouse modes and drag tool are far superior.</td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody">&#13;

The rendering engine is a lot more impressive than the level editor.&#13;

Go to the product websites, and you'll see this.&#13;<br /><br />Ok, so besides the basic capabilities, there are 2 issues at hand when considering a new modeling package: interface, and documentation.&#13;<br /><br />Again, most packages are going to be well documented, but the older ones are going to have more. So something like silo or modo might be great, but you're going to find more studio max tutorials. Alias puts out awesome learning tools, but they ain't free.&#13;<br /><br />That leaves interface, and that's big. And it's very subjective. You just gotta try 'em all out, and see what sticks.

Plus, they're halving the price to $700 for the entire package of modeler and layout (and you'll be able to model directly in layout) - that will  definitely be the most powerful and cheapest 3d software you'll be able to buy. <br /> Newtek have pulled a great new team together, after the luxology traitors deserted,  are completely rewriting lightwave from the ground up, and they're finially starting to make some long awaited changes.

I'd probably use it myself if I was just starting out, but I can work so perfectly in lightwave now, I don't want to change, and it has some features missing that lightwave doesn't have, plus I can't stand manipulator handles.

Go to the product websites, and you'll see this.
<br /><br />Ok, so besides the basic capabilities, there are 2 issues at hand when considering a new modeling package: interface, and documentation.
<br /><br />Again, most packages are going to be well documented, but the older ones are going to have more. So something like silo or modo might be great, but you're going to find more studio max tutorials. Alias puts out awesome learning tools, but they ain't free.
<br /><br />That leaves interface, and that's big. And it's very subjective. You just gotta try 'em all out, and see what sticks. Personally, I dig maya, because its structure makes my inner unix geek happy.

I'm not going to go into how poor LW is compared to Maya, Max, even Blender.&#13;
<br/><br/>
But this statement is overly cliche and is very wrong, unless you mean poor in the economic sense.  Besides, LW is not my tool.&#13;

The person wanted info about LW, he got it.</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

you are a troll just simple as that.&#13;
<br/><br/>
@ anyone use the software you like , but try it forself, don't give more than 1 cent to such strange opinions...&#13;
<br/><br/>
I could you tell the same about max, but i don't tell it....why ? well for me is the UI of max just terrible, and its workflow doesen't work for <span style="font-weight: bold">me</span>, but only me, so i would not come here to say max ist a piece of shit....&#13;
<br/><br/>
It just does not fit to me, simple as it is.&#13;
<br/><br/><br/><br/>
i work with XSI and Lightwave and Zbrush2 what i want more...hehe &#13;
<br/><br/>
(and yes, legal copies...)&#13;

<br/><br/>
I tried it several years ago and thought I didn't have any 3D skill at all.  I've since learned Maya and 3DS Max and now that I try to learn the new version, I see that its the program, not me.  Its an act in flustration just importing an .OBJ, selecting it, centering it, and saving in .LWO&#13;
<br/><br/>
Avoid Lightwave if at all possible!  It is crap compared to other simular apps!&#13;
<br/><br/>
Maybe it renders well or something, don't know, don't care.</td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody"><br/>_________________<br/>wfg  aRKeycH</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>
