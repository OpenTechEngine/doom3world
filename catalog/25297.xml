Deleting the file &amp; re-running the bsp compiler should fix the issue. I know that sometimes fixes Doom 3 map issues that are correct in the editor.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p237290" date="Posted: Fri Feb 03, 2012 2:17 am "><author>baseliner</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks for replying, i tried deleting and recompiling the map.<br />Sadly it didn't work..<br />Any ideas?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p237291" date="Posted: Fri Feb 03, 2012 2:23 am "><author>Serpentine</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">SoF might not use the strength of the specular map, while d3 does.<br /><br />As such you might need to do something like :<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">    {<br />        blend       specularmap<br />        map         textures/derp/hurpad_s<br />        rgb         0.1<br />    }</div><br /><br />If the specular makes it look a bit better, play with the value until it's looking correct.
