Then when you consider how many characters, monsters, weapons, items, texture 'bits' and everything else, it all adds up.<br /><br />Like I said, it's way too easy for people to assume a neat little package that can be baked over one rainy weekend on their home PC.<br /><br />Though I do wish they'd release just one, say that sexy Hellknight, just to show amateurs what worlds apart exist, even after years.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p246204" date="Posted: Sun Jan 20, 2013 5:07 am "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Zombie13 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">The Happy Friar wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">Zombie13 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Although my hat goes off to Ubi they've got an intranet site you can use to look at pretty much every mesh that was used in almost every ubi game for the last 10 years, it's great for finding place holders and building content quickly.</div><br /><br />Prove it by posting a pic of something from Beyond Good and Evil.

The way the modeldefs and materials are set up you could just search and replace a few numbers and given the original source tree you'd have it ready to go.<br /><br />I realize the way real world production ends up, it's not always so clean, but the way they had render bump and their pipeline set up it seems like that was a part of the system design.<br /><br />D3 is probably the last game that's going to be possible for, nowadays you get normal maps from so many different sources, crazy bump etc. The vast majority of D3 surfaces actually have a hi poly model.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p246206" date="Posted: Sun Jan 20, 2013 3:09 pm "><author>tea monster</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Considering that the assets were all made in 2003 or so, you would be better served to make your own. You could even use the original models as a base mesh and sculpt up some mega-detail so that you could bake it back onto the original model, or up the res a level and use them as your new game models. <br /><br />This is no offence to the good people at Id, but time and tech marches on, and it wouldn't take you that long to sculpt a pretty storming new Imp or Baron with a copy of Sculptris, ZBrush, or even Blender.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p246208" date="Posted: Sun Jan 20, 2013 4:08 pm "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">The real craftsmanship of game modelling is NOT the creation of ultra high poly meshes.

So to some degree it was Quake that appropriated that from doom 1 &amp; 2. Still I agree with your overall point.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p246298" date="Posted: Sat Jan 26, 2013 5:12 am "><author>The Happy Friar</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I never thought D3 took from the Strogg designs.  Doom already had a skeleton with rocket launchers on it's back, a giant fat thing with rocket launchers for arms, a giant cyborg walking monster, a cyborg spider &amp; a smaller cyborg spider.<br /><br />D3 took away the spiders (which were AWESOME), kept the other three cyborg-ish monsters &amp; added two more: the pinky became cyborg &amp; the combo marine+tank.<br /><br />Q4's character design I just loved compared to D3's though.  I'm dissapointed they didn't use more of the monsters from Q2 but the ones that they re-designed I loved.  What ruined it with Q4 for me was the fact that Prey had already come out, was one of my favorite games &amp; Raven really stripped down D3 to where it wasn't as fun as Prey.  Sure, they had outside areas, but they could of reduced those &amp; done something else more quake-ish.</div>]]></body></post></posts></thread></xml>
