This results in a different organization of the objects and their relationships. The point is that people who do character animation with Blender are likely to end up with the object setup that the exporter expects.<br /><br />The reason why there is no tutorial about this packaged with my exporter, is because it is not specific to my exporter, but it is something about Blender in general. Here is a wikipage that explains the stuff, the sections "Armature Objects" and "Mesh Objects" are the interesting ones in this context:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Advanced_Tutorials/Advanced_Animation/index">http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Blender_3D ... tion/index</a><!-- m --> (googling for keywords like "Blender armature tutorial" will probably give you a bunch of other useful pages)<br /><br />To export your object with my exporter, you have to merge all your machine part objects into one mesh object, parent this object to the armature object, and then assign the vertices of the former parts objects to their respective bones. There are several methods to do this: envelopes, weight painting, and manual selection which I think is best suited for rigid binding.</div>]]></body></post></posts></thread></xml>
