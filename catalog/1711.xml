<br /><br />As I mentioned, use Blender2.28a or 2.28c
<br /><br />Then, in order to execute complicated python scripts in Blender, you have to install Python. Download <span style="font-weight: bold">Python2.2.3</span> here:
<br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.2.3/Python-2.2.3.exe" class="postlink">http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.2.3/Python-2.2.3.exe</a> (7 MB)
<br /><br />There are newer versions of Python, but this version is the one that works with Blender2.28. That should be the first step.
<br /><br />Then the next step is to update your system variables. You need a new system variable called PYTHONPATH, and it must be set to something like this:
<br />C:\Python22\lib;C:\Python22\;C:\Python22\DLLs;C:\Python22\tcl;C:\Python22\libs\
<br /><br />Ofcourse that´s if you installed Python to C:\Python22
<br /><br />If you don´t know how to set that PYTHONPATH system variable, read more information:

Since the beginning of the script in 2004 some version of Blender changed the API in a way that broke something and I haven't sorted that out, I'll have to take a look.

If your animated character is the only object in the scene then it's all good ofcourse, otherwise the boundingbox might end up too large.<br />In Doom3 engine games, the boundingbox is not used for physics, but only for the renderer to cull offscreen models. Too large boundingboxes are not a problem, they only cost a little performance in cases where the character is actually offscreen but its boundingbox is not.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p208827" date="Posted: Sat Dec 20, 2008 5:53 pm "><author>Tamarin</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I am having trouble exporting the bounding box as well. <br /><br />Everything else works fine, so thanks to der_ton, blender programmers and many others.<br /><br />Here is an example .blend<br /><br /><a href="/web/20081226113440/http://www.mediafire.com/?sharekey=cae3abfced201390d2db6fb9a8902bda" class="postlink">http://www.mediafire.com/?sharekey=cae3abfced201390d2db6fb9a8902bda</a></div>]]></body></post><post id="p208921" date="Posted: Tue Dec 23, 2008 1:12 pm "><author>der_ton</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Which of the files is it exactly?

You don´t have to do a whole animation, just define two different keyframes for at least one bone 
<br /><br />(with the skeleton selected, go to "pose mode", select a bone and press I ('insert keyframe'), select "LocRot" for the requested type of keyframe. That sets the first keyframe.

<br /><br />See how characters skirt is stretched and squashed in the front and squashed and lowered down on the back?! 
<br />It's not suppose to be like that, it suppose to be just like in Blender.
<br />is there any way der_ton could look at that and fix the exporter please?
<br /><br />Here is my .blend file for test purposes.

<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">EDIT:</span> Another thing is that MD5 exporter exports all meshes, even those that are in other inactive layers (let's say I have animated mesh in Layer1 and few meshes in Layer2).

Scaling is ignored by the exporter because MD5 doesn't support that.
<br /><br />Or do you mean the shading? That must be because of discontinuous UV mapping.
<br /><br />You can send me your blend file by mail or link if none of this helps.
<br /><br />Yeah the exporter exports everything, I should change that so it exports only those meshes that are parented to the skeleton. I don't know why I didn't do that a long time ago...  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203142434im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p170362" date="Posted: Mon Feb 12, 2007 3:50 pm "><author>motorsep</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">der_ton,

<br />No bone scaling has been done. So it's an issue with the exporter I believe.

The meshes are not parented to the armature, I'm not sure if this is causing the geometry glitches on the skirt but I'd recommend you try it out. When I quickly wanted to try it myself, while parenting a skinned mesh to the armature, it deformed a bit because it was already bound to the armature, I'm not sure what to make of this. Maybe there's a workaround, but in the worst case you'll have to do the vertex weighting again. Maybe someone on one of the blender forums knows about this problem.
<br /><br />On a sidenote about Blender and organizing the objects in character animation, I find it strange that a mesh can be bound to an armature for deformation, without having that armature as a parent object. What if there are several armatures in the scene, with bones that have names like bones in the other armature? Which armature is the mesh supposed to follow?
<br /><br />I'll send you the 'beta' version of the updated exporter that exports only meshes that are parented to the armature (which solves the problem that you mentioned that all geometry in the scene gets exported), and it also supports many armatures in the scene. The one that is selected will be exported, same with camera export (if that was ever used by anyone, heh).</div>]]></body></post><post id="p181096" date="Posted: Sat Jun 16, 2007 9:25 am "><author>sarcius</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I'm currently using der_ton's Blender-&gt;MD5 exporter, and I seem to be getting extra vertices exported with the model.

If in Blender your mesh has discontinuous uvs (for example in an un-uv'ed mesh, the python script sees discontinuous uvs on every triangle), the vertices have to be split so that for each adjacent triangle the uvs can be different. 
<br /><br />To make a long story short, your mesh probably doesn't have uvs assigned yet, or your normals are not smoothed, which also forces the script to duplicate vertices for each adjacent triangle.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p181133" date="Posted: Sat Jun 16, 2007 6:29 pm "><author>sarcius</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I don't know if calling "Set Smooth" should have set the smooth normals that you were talking about (I'm still slightly new to Blender), but after setting that and unwrapping again I have (on another, simpler object I was testing with) 64 vertices exported to the md5mesh file as opposed to 88...however the model has 24 in Blender.
<br /><br />With the more complex model I was referring to, I "Set Smooth" and it lowered the number of vertices in the exported file to 1166, a large improvement over the 3456 from before.
<br /><br />Thank you for your fast response!  I assume these extra vertices are from my uvmap not being fully connected when I unwrapped it (using the automatic unwrapper).

You have to look up the line that says "shader". If the model has more than one section, each using their own material, then there is more than one "shader" line.

Having a link to this thread is a good idea.<br /><br />Yes there is something wrong with the boundingbox info generated by the script. Since the beginning of the script in 2004 some version of Blender changed the API in a way that broke something and I haven't sorted that out, I'll have to take a look. Also I am going to update the script to incorporate the improvements that BlackHC and Tr3B made (<!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081204022511/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?f=50&amp;t=21795">viewtopic.php?f=50&amp;t=21795</a><!-- l -->).<br /><br />The current way of handling boundingboxes in their script is to have the boundingbox that encompasses all the mesh objects in the scene. If your animated character is the only object in the scene then it's all good ofcourse, otherwise the boundingbox might end up too large.<br />In Doom3 engine games, the boundingbox is not used for physics, but only for the renderer to cull offscreen models. Too large boundingboxes are not a problem, they only cost a little performance in cases where the character is actually offscreen but its boundingbox is not.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p15743" date="Posted: Mon Nov 24, 2003 5:36 pm "><author>der_ton</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold">edit</span>: Look at my latest post on page 4 of this thread.<br /><!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="viewtopic.php?p=130466#130466">viewtopic.php?p=130466#130466</a><!-- l --><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://home.mnet-online.de/der/blender2md5.rar">http://home.mnet-online.de/der/blender2md5.rar</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><br /><br />Outdated info:<br /><br />It has been completed a while ago, but BNA was away and couldn´t upload it. Thanks to him for uploading it so soon after his return!<br /><br />Read the readme (duh), and read the other details that I included in the script itself (the header of the script is its own readme, kind of).<br /><br />The script does NOT work with Blender2.30. Blender2.30 was announced as a "preview" version for the 2.3x gui features, and it apparently is exactly that, a <span style="font-weight: bold">preview</span> (get what I mean?).

That's really a big step forward to be able to use freeware for Doom3 animations. I think I will stay at Maya nevertheless, but it's good to know that this is possible now.

<br /><br />As I mentioned, use Blender2.28a or 2.28c
<br /><br />Then, in order to execute complicated python scripts in Blender, you have to install Python. Download <span style="font-weight: bold">Python2.2.3</span> here:
<br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.2.3/Python-2.2.3.exe" class="postlink">http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.2.3/Python-2.2.3.exe</a> (7 MB)
<br /><br />There are newer versions of Python, but this version is the one that works with Blender2.28. That should be the first step.
<br /><br />Then the next step is to update your system variables. You need a new system variable called PYTHONPATH, and it must be set to something like this:
<br />C:\Python22\lib;C:\Python22\;C:\Python22\DLLs;C:\Python22\tcl;C:\Python22\libs\
<br /><br />Ofcourse that´s if you installed Python to C:\Python22
<br /><br />If you don´t know how to set that PYTHONPATH system variable, read more information:

My rough idea of how this would be done doesn't need the armature part of the api because you don't have to get any armature data out of blender since you don't care how the vertices are animated, you just sample the whole mesh each frame and save all vertices as md5-bones.
<br /><br />There's something like a getRawFromData() function (I might be wrong but it should be some similar name), that provides you with the raw blender mesh AFTER all animations have been applied. That's what has to be used for this exporter.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p140982" date="Posted: Tue Apr 25, 2006 2:09 am "><author>mcbeth</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">thanks I'll check stuff out and see what happens</div>]]></body></post><post id="p153152" date="Posted: Thu Aug 10, 2006 10:00 pm "><author>MelGibbsome</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">ok I'm a newb to this stuff.
<br /><br />I just installed the script and it shows up as doom3 md5 in the file export drop down list.
<br /><br />i've got a 4 window set up (top, side, front, camera) so the camera view IS visible.
<br /><br />I select doom3 md5 from teh file/export list.  a window pops up at the bottom with buttons saying export camera, and wanting mesh and anim files.  i set the mesh to my blend file name (its a simple one frame bishop chess piece) and I click on export.  the screen flashes and thats it.
<br /><br />no md5 file to be found anywhere.
<br /><br />what am i doing wrong please?
<br /><br />and oh yeah...it DID trash my original blend file and i had to redo the bishop.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p153168" date="Posted: Thu Aug 10, 2006 11:41 pm "><author>MelGibbsome</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">ok like i said im REALLY A NEWB to this......
<br /><br />when it asked for the mesh file I thought it was asking for SOURCE and not the destination and I was actually over writing my blend with the md5 file!
<br /><br />NOW my problem is.........it writes a 1k file and i gave it a md5 extension which q4 doesnt see, (just realized) so i renamed it to lwo and when i import it, i just get this little cube, not my model.
<br /><br />SO does this script create lwo files?  All's im trying to make here is simple chess pieces that will be imported to q4 map.  I tried making them directly in q4 and altho they look okay in the editor, they get anomlies in game do to requiring too much rendering i guess.
<br /><br />so can i get some help on this please??? thanks</div>]]></body></post><post id="p153173" date="Posted: Fri Aug 11, 2006 2:25 am "><author>kat</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">the extension is *md5mesh* and *md5anim* not just *md5*. When you're exporting the mesh it;s obviously best to call it something else and then add the extension to the end; so 'widget.md5mesh' and 'widget.md5anim', that way the exporter won't overwrite anything and it'll create the correctly named file for you.
<br /><br />If the chess piece isn't meant to animate (using a proper skeleton) then export it out as a proper LWO or ASE file, don't bother with MD5.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p153219" date="Posted: Fri Aug 11, 2006 4:17 pm "><author>MelGibbsome</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">yes i saw where i could export as lwo afterall.........like i said, I'm new to this modeling stuff and don't have a clue.
<br /><br />i tried reading the tutorial on preparing blender object for lwo but it was over my head.
<br /><br />only took me like 30 mins to make my first piece and 10 for the second (in blender).
<br /><br />now all's i want to do is export the damn thing and it's apparently more complicated than just clicking on export!
<br /><br />oh and when i do just click on export as lwo? for one object i get a python script error and for the other i get a beep and screen flash.  in both cases, a 0kb lwo file is created. (BTW, where IN THE HELL is "the console"??? Every time I get a script error, it says "see console".... I can find NO control to click on to show the console!)
<br /><br />Now, I am guessing that when you click on the export lwo file and it asks for the file name, it is asking for the DESTINATION and not the source? Wish the stupid program would automatically call the file the name of the project with the correct type of extension at the end, as a default, just like every other program under God's green earth!
<br /><br />sigh</div>]]></body></post><post id="p153225" date="Posted: Fri Aug 11, 2006 4:46 pm "><author>kat</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">LOL ok, 1st things 1st. The 'console' in Blender is the DOS box that's open behind the main app window, if you minimise Blender you'll see it sitting in the desktop approx top left of the screen. Any errors etc are output there.
<br /><br />What version of Blender are you using?
<br /><br />You're probably best of using ASE for now as the way LWO materials need to be set up in Blender *is* a little confusing if you've not done it before (which reminds me, I need to get a video tutorial for this done).
<br /><br />ASE is much easier to do. Just model, UVWmap and texture the object as normal, triangulate the mesh (Ctrl+T) and then with it still selected run the script (make sure you use the right version).
<br /><br />Make sure you use a different file name than the one you're working on (it's just common sense to do this because as you've found you'll inadvertantly overwrite the source file if you're not careful) and append .ase to it. Just hit the button and you should be done.

<br /><br />As I mentioned, use Blender2.28a or 2.28c
<br /><br />Then, in order to execute complicated python scripts in Blender, you have to install Python. Download <span style="font-weight: bold">Python2.2.3</span> here:
<br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.2.3/Python-2.2.3.exe" class="postlink">http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.2.3/Python-2.2.3.exe</a> (7 MB)
<br /><br />There are newer versions of Python, but this version is the one that works with Blender2.28. That should be the first step.
<br /><br />Then the next step is to update your system variables. You need a new system variable called PYTHONPATH, and it must be set to something like this:
<br />C:\Python22\lib;C:\Python22\;C:\Python22\DLLs;C:\Python22\tcl;C:\Python22\libs\
<br /><br />Ofcourse that´s if you installed Python to C:\Python22
<br /><br />If you don´t know how to set that PYTHONPATH system variable, read more information:

<br /><br />As I mentioned, use Blender2.28a or 2.28c
<br /><br />Then, in order to execute complicated python scripts in Blender, you have to install Python. Download <span style="font-weight: bold">Python2.2.3</span> here:
<br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.2.3/Python-2.2.3.exe" class="postlink">http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.2.3/Python-2.2.3.exe</a> (7 MB)
<br /><br />There are newer versions of Python, but this version is the one that works with Blender2.28. That should be the first step.
<br /><br />Then the next step is to update your system variables. You need a new system variable called PYTHONPATH, and it must be set to something like this:
<br />C:\Python22\lib;C:\Python22\;C:\Python22\DLLs;C:\Python22\tcl;C:\Python22\libs\
<br /><br />Ofcourse that´s if you installed Python to C:\Python22

<br /><br />As I mentioned, use Blender2.28a or 2.28c
<br /><br />Then, in order to execute complicated python scripts in Blender, you have to install Python. Download <span style="font-weight: bold">Python2.2.3</span> here:
<br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.2.3/Python-2.2.3.exe" class="postlink">http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.2.3/Python-2.2.3.exe</a> (7 MB)
<br /><br />There are newer versions of Python, but this version is the one that works with Blender2.28. That should be the first step.
<br /><br />Then the next step is to update your system variables. You need a new system variable called PYTHONPATH, and it must be set to something like this:
<br />C:\Python22\lib;C:\Python22\;C:\Python22\DLLs;C:\Python22\tcl;C:\Python22\libs\
<br /><br />Ofcourse that´s if you installed Python to C:\Python22

<br /><br />Ofcourse that´s if you installed Python to C:\Python22

<br /><br />As I mentioned, use Blender2.28a or 2.28c

<br /><br />There are newer versions of Python, but this version is the one that works with Blender2.28. That should be the first step.
<br /><br />Then the next step is to update your system variables. You need a new system variable called PYTHONPATH, and it must be set to something like this:
<br />C:\Python22\lib;C:\Python22\;C:\Python22\DLLs;C:\Python22\tcl;C:\Python22\libs\

<br /><br />As I mentioned, use Blender2.28a or 2.28c
<br /><br />Then, in order to execute complicated python scripts in Blender, you have to install Python. Download <span style="font-weight: bold">Python2.2.3</span> here:
<br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.2.3/Python-2.2.3.exe" class="postlink">http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.2.3/Python-2.2.3.exe</a> (7 MB)
<br /><br />There are newer versions of Python, but this version is the one that works with Blender2.28. That should be the first step.
<br /><br />Then the next step is to update your system variables. You need a new system variable called PYTHONPATH, and it must be set to something like this:
<br />C:\Python22\lib;C:\Python22\;C:\Python22\DLLs;C:\Python22\tcl;C:\Python22\libs\
<br /><br />Ofcourse that´s if you installed Python to C:\Python22

Thanks to him for uploading it so soon after his return!<br /><br />Read the readme (duh), and read the other details that I included in the script itself (the header of the script is its own readme, kind of).<br /><br />The script does NOT work with Blender2.30. Blender2.30 was announced as a "preview" version for the 2.3x gui features, and it apparently is exactly that, a <span style="font-weight: bold">preview</span> (get what I mean?). Just stick to 2.28a or 2.28c until they release a proper 2.3x.<br /><br />Things to come: a new version of my md5viewer (300% speed gain  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101018034921im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil" />, more accurate lighting, especially on low-end cards), including an animated md5 character ("Bob", made by <span style="font-weight: bold">Kat</span>, look at the WIP forum here). Animation was done in Blender, using this script to export to md5.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101018034921im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p15750" date="Posted: Mon Nov 24, 2003 6:38 pm "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Hey - my pleasure to click the upload button while you're doing all the awsome work!

That's really a big step forward to be able to use freeware for Doom3 animations. I think I will stay at Maya nevertheless, but it's good to know that this is possible now. 
<br /><br />Would be cool if you could also write an exporter for 3DSMax Animation. There is already one that exports ASE to md5mesh, but until now you can't export the animations.
<br /><br />Good work!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p15780" date="Posted: Tue Nov 25, 2003 12:21 am "><author>der_ton</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Ok, some "requirements" for that script:
<br /><br />As I mentioned, use Blender2.28a or 2.28c
<br /><br />Then, in order to execute complicated python scripts in Blender, you have to install Python. Download <span style="font-weight: bold">Python2.2.3</span> here:
<br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101018034921/http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.2.3/Python-2.2.3.exe" class="postlink">http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.2.3/Python-2.2.3.exe</a> (7 MB)
<br /><br />There are newer versions of Python, but this version is the one that works with Blender2.28. That should be the first step.
<br /><br />Then the next step is to update your system variables. You need a new system variable called PYTHONPATH, and it must be set to something like this:
<br />C:\Python22\lib;C:\Python22\;C:\Python22\DLLs;C:\Python22\tcl;C:\Python22\libs\
<br /><br />Ofcourse that´s if you installed Python to C:\Python22
<br /><br />If you don´t know how to set that PYTHONPATH system variable, read more information:
