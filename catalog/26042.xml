Put it in the Doom3 folder now it should show up in mods.<br />As for crashing are you using an ati gfx card ? if you are theres been some problems with doom3 and ati mostly related to the catalyst AI. You can find info on how to disable it around the net but the easiest way is just renaming your Doom3.exe to something else. It can also be related to unstable hardware if it crashes to the Doom3 console (the blue window) try posting what it prints.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p244589" date="Posted: Thu Nov 29, 2012 2:58 pm "><author>Steve1664</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">My card's an NVidia GeForce, which ran Sikk with basic Doom 3 with no problems, so that's not the culprit.
