I kept meaning to, but just never go around to it.
<br /><br />When you have your map loaded and you run editFX from the console, click the View menu in the FX Editor and then "Entity Editor".  
<br /><br />You can then choose all of your FX entities from a pulldown list.  Once you've selected one, you can alter its properties and tweak it.  When you're done, click the "Save Map" button.  Check the console for a message about your map being saved.
<br /><br />You can also use this entity editor to drop new FX entities into your map in front of your player's view, meaning, very similar to the sound editor and speakers, you can literally noclip your way around your map in the FX Editor and plop down and tweak all of your FX.  
<br /><br />I did all of my FX editing in singleplayer mode given some of the saving issues that came up when trying to make changes to a map that was spawned on a server.
<br /><br />Let me know if that helps.

<br /><br />Hiya guys this is my first post here so first I wanna say hi to everyone.
<br /><br />Goliath I watched the tutorial and have to say I thought it was pretty well done.  Everything was well described.  I now feel moved to try and make my own FX.
<br /><br />One thing I did notice is that around 1/2 to 3/4 of the way through the audio was a little faster than exactly what was going on on the screen.  Wasn't sure if mabey you recorded video than the audio or if you are just used to working a little quicker than you speak(I get this problem from time to time) <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225131315im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> .
<br /><br />Looking forward to any other tutorials you may do.
<br /><br />In  a nutshell, EXCELENT WORK!.
<br /><br />Cheers guys.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p117404" date="Posted: Sat Oct 22, 2005 5:29 pm "><author>goliathvt</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Yah, it's a problem with the compression format I used... the longer the vid goes on, it gets more and more outta sync.

<br /><br />It's not a problem at all.  I could follow along perfectly. 
<br /><br />Also the no quality loss at a high res with only 47 megs is awsome!  I love watching full screen so I don't get distracted by background items.
<br /><br />Are you planning on making more or was this just a test run for the FX editor?

<br /><br />I do plan on making at least one more FX-related tutorial where I walk through the process of making an FX with custom content, and build a fairly complex FX with all the pieces.  Other than that, the only other video tutorial that I personally think "needs" to be done is one for the AF (Articulated Figure) editor... no one's ever done one that I know of and most people have trouble with AFs in general, it seems.  I've personally not done a tut. on it because I suck at 3d modeling/rigging, which is sort of a pre-req to even using the AF. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225131315im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />  My little AOheLl buddy that I've used for some other tutorials is about the extent of my 3d animation skills.... 
<br /><br />So... if someone supplies me a properly rigged character in Maya and MD5 format, I'd be happy to use 'em for the AF tutorial. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225131315im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Goliath</div>]]></body></post><post id="p118971" date="Posted: Sat Oct 29, 2005 9:46 am "><author>goliathvt</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Updated the links to my vid tut with some slight fixes.

<br /><br />True that. The Q4 Particles are quite an Improvement over the D3 ones, Feature- and Editor-wise <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225131315im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p119050" date="Posted: Sat Oct 29, 2005 9:10 pm "><author>evilartist</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Wow! That tutorial was helpful as hell! <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225131315im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> I'm already making my own FXs now, but I'm having a problem with one:
<br /><br />I made a simple, drop-of-water-hits-puddle FX. There are four stages:
<br /><br />1) A sprite that resembles a drop that fades in and out as it falls.
<br />2) An oriented sprite on the ground that resembles a small "ripple" when the drop (#1) hits the wet surface.
<br />3) An ambient dripping sound (not really needed)
<br />4) A sprite that produces 3 to 4 half-sized drops, it resembles a small "splash" coming from the first, bigger drop after impact with the ground.
<br /><br />The problem here is whenever I add any new stages after the first four--no matter how long a delay I put in between #4 and #5, no matter what time I start the next stage (#5), number four only goes exactly when five does. #4 is supposed to go in sync with #2 (the "ripple"), but waits until #5 kicks in. Why?
<br /><br />If you don't know what I mean, I can always send you the FX.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p119083" date="Posted: Sat Oct 29, 2005 11:56 pm "><author>port66</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">iceheart wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">port66 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">nothing to be tought. its straight forward. like the whole engine Vs unreal editors etc. and 100% scripts in notepad</div><br /><br />Eh...

<br /><br />1&gt;choose a fx [sprite = texture. pathto/filename no extenstion]
<br />2&gt;click on the origin tab. up/down/left and right
<br />3&gt;length - forward/up
<br />3&gt;rotate
<br /><br />the rest is alpha blending which is easily understood
<br /><br />for lightning.
<br /><br />choose electric.
<br />find a electricity texture, best is probaly [gfx\effects\electricity\electric_blue] for the sprite
<br />goto length. put forward to 60min/500max, set the width to around 40.
<br />click on teh motion tab. and set the forks to 3. dont go below 0.1. because quake will crash. and set the rate to 3
<br /><br />then add a light. and set the depth. and always stay on. click on motion tab and do some alpha blending. and tweak the settings till the light kind of matches the electricity</div>]]></body></post><post id="p119095" date="Posted: Sun Oct 30, 2005 12:48 am "><author>port66</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">heres <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225131315/http://irgoslak.org/xremote/lightning.fx" class="postlink">lightning.fx</a> just made. and here a avi. which is xvid codec if you have it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225131315/http://irgoslak.org/xremote/lightning.avi" class="postlink">avi</a></div>]]></body></post><post id="p119793" date="Posted: Wed Nov 02, 2005 8:09 pm "><author>MelvinB</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Is there a written tutorial about this?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p119860" date="Posted: Thu Nov 03, 2005 5:57 am "><author>AUS_PaRa</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">This was an excellent tut, thanks heaps for your time and effort I appreciate this.

<br /><br />The only thing that kinda surprised my, was the fact that <span style="color: green">editFX</span> <span style="color: red">changes</span> the <span style="color: green">.fx</span> on the fly! So folks will want to be very careful not to destroy their "hand coded" <span style="color: green">.fx</span> (e.g. lose comments added), or even worse to change original <span style="color: green">.fx</span> files.
<br /><br />In hindsight, <span style="color: green">editFX</span> must change the files for them to show, but coming from Q3A where almost nothing is in real time it was a shock :p</div>]]></body></post><post id="p152361" date="Posted: Sat Aug 05, 2006 3:43 pm "><author>Finko</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Perhaps I'm being a bit lazy, but why can't I browse for materials or sounds/soundshaders inside this editor?

Ever care to reupload so many here, so many there? Of course that would be a daunting task so naturally only a few at a time over the course of days or whatever is convenient, but overall the feedback, picture images and links have gone down considerably over the past 4 years or so. I know it's an old game but hell classic doom probably has much more modding and mod tutorials etc.. on the internet than this!</div>]]></body></post></posts></thread></xml>
