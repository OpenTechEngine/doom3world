<br/><br/>
Perhaps you know the export to obj button in the d3/q4radiant ... where you can save your geoemtry in an obj file to load it later in lightwave.&#13;
<br/><br/>
This thing was working fine for me but now perhaps since i updated lw to 8.5 from 8.3.. its no more able to read my exported obj map geometry!!&#13;
<br/><br/>
What is going wrong? Should i take 8.3 or is there a new method in 8.5 to get this obj files loaded, terrain making for q4 is no fun without this method :[ so pls help me&#13;
<br/><br/>
