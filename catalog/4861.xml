A little tip: Try to explain a little bit more how to do the stuff you wrote in the tutorial. Your tutorial looks like its been written only to the veterans in the editor. If a noob (like me) will read the tutorial, it will be hard for him to understand what to do.
<br /><br /><br />EDIT: Maybe it's only hard to me because English is my second language.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p42046" date="Posted: Thu Aug 26, 2004 9:01 am "><author>mcrat</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">If you don't understand what i say (i am not english), here, you can download the test map to show you how to make a sentry...

In addition, indicate how you layed out your path_corners - how did you make them, what did you name them ? How did you put the entities in your map ?
<br /><br />You have to put yourself in the position of somebody who doesn't have a clue about the editor, because, to be honest, anyone who has knowledge of the editor will simply look at the id software maps to get info on sentries.
<br /><br />For screenshots, there are free screenshot hosting services out there :-
