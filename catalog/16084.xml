<br /><br />Is there a quick and easy way to take quake 3 models and convert them for use  / or import to Q4?
<br /><br />I want to use them as statues on some of my maps ... a nostalgia thing.
<br /><br />NOTE: I don't have any modeling software, so I can't do what one thread suggested...opening them with said software, freezing them and exporting as md5.
<br /><br />If there's no way it can be done without said software, is there a resource of models converted anywhere, where I could get them?
<br /><br />thanks</div>]]></body></post><post id="p146176" date="Posted: Fri Jun 16, 2006 7:55 pm "><author>BloodRayne</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I think there is free software available that does it, such as Blender or Gmax.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p146179" date="Posted: Fri Jun 16, 2006 8:01 pm "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">BloodRayne wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I think there is free software available that does it, such as Blender or Gmax.</div>

Blender can do this very easily however you might need to find a plugin to import the Q3 model with.  Based on what I'm about to say below I won't go any further.
<br /><br />There is a problem though, what you're suggesting would most likely be in violation of id's EULA for both Q3 and Q4.  This is kind of a "fine line" issue though but you might reconsider doing it just for the sake of staying out of trouble <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203102446im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p146183" date="Posted: Fri Jun 16, 2006 9:04 pm "><author>MelGibbsome</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I dont see how it would be a problem with ID........a model from one version of their game being used in another version of their game?

<br />i dont know if it works but try to place the .md3 mesh into gtkradiant and export it with q3map2 as an .ase mesh. the .ase should work in d3radint. 
<br />the model is there: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203061625/http://fps.brainerd.net/mapmodels15.htm">http://fps.brainerd.net/mapmodels15.htm</a><!-- m -->
<br />if you are on the lucky side you maybe find other free usable statues there. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203061625im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />i used another model in a q3 showmap but cant remember if it was a q3 stoick model or custom.

<br /><br />I've asked id before about this and the answer was no.
<br /><br />I really do wish they would take some of the doom3 marines and port them to quake4 for mp  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203061625im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> I missed that about quake3's mp, all the id characters from the past were there.</div>]]></body></post></posts></thread></xml>
