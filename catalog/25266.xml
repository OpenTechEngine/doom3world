Im not a scripter and Im sloooooowly learning but is there a way I can make the recoil alternate randomly between multiple recoil angles? I want a slight tactical shooter like recoil, its a cheap simulation where single shots are dead on but uncontrollable firing will recoil to the recoil angles.  If I can do this how would I define in in scripts to cycle randomly through recoil angles?<br /><br />or<br /><br />I dont know much about anything in scripting, but I was suggesting that (well, for starters I'll learn it <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130403075803im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> ) When the gun fires I have a range of min-max spread for the gun, the spread value increases as the number of launched projectiles increases, where the minimum spread is 0 and max is like 5. The spread value increases over time, like 3 seconds.</div>]]></body></post></posts></thread></xml>
