When you learn the interface a bit (it's not even THAT much), it is much faster then most other apps. At least in terms of accessibillity, not neccessarily rendering speed. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203140803im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />And concerning the interface - you have to learn any app. All bigger 3D apps are geared to improve the modelling speed. The more user friendly it gets (for new users), the slower it will be, because it needs menus and such stuff, where you constantly have the mouse to shift around. In Blender you can really focus on the modelling act, and I must say - even though it looks daunting at first, there are not THAT many keys to memorize.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p178329" date="Posted: Wed May 16, 2007 10:31 pm "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">agreed, I much rather use blenders ui including the shortcut keys then any other app I can think of.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p178332" date="Posted: Wed May 16, 2007 10:35 pm "><author>ajm113</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I can't wait to try it!
