You remind me of a bible-belter full of hot air. They go on and on about family values and purity, yet are caught with a hooker, a gay lover, and a dysfunctional family. Do you secretly like Wolf2K9? It's okay, you can be honest. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320002023im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p221024" date="Posted: Fri Dec 11, 2009 12:32 pm "><author>Burrito</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Wow, we reached religion with this thread.

True, we should take a stand against the kingdom of darkness as children of light but the weapons we should use are not those of this world - where does using a shotgun to blast away demons figure in God's plan? I see absolutely no constructive Christian purpose for playing this game, nothing good at all can come from this, it should be avoided at all costs and so too should its sequels which are far worse! (Doom is quite mild compared to some of the recent offerings from ID - Doom II, Quake etc and of course Quake 3 which I would utterly condemn! My Ratings: [1/3]</div><br /><br />And this little gem:<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Christian Rating: There hasn’t been a game that I would more than happily throw away after I just purchased it for fifty-five dollars than this one. The graphics are superb and sound is just down right awesome, but nothing will make up for the complete satanic feel and exposure this game will bring. As a twenty-one year old I have to say I was freaked out, disturbed, and horrified by Doom III’s content. I can’t imagine what a thirteen year old would feel like. After hours of exposure to this game, I could see a child’s attitude and personality change because of this game. I would have displayed more images but due to the graphic and satanic nature of this game I just couldn’t show it. Stay far away from Doom III it has no value to it at all. <span style="font-weight: bold">I would highly recommend that anyone who professes themselves to be Christians, to NOT PLAY THIS GAME.</span><br /><br />Conclusion: Rating: 0 out of 5 due to high levels of occult images and sounds, massive gore, and terrifying exposure to hell and demons. No game has gone so far as Doom III.</div><br /><br />And this guy claims that ID made D3 to promote Satanism (Because all we do is hug demons in this game).<br /><div class="quotetitle">http://www.christianforums.com/t1437385/ wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I don't agree with such games.

True, we should take a stand against the kingdom of darkness as children of light but the weapons we should use are not those of this world - where does using a shotgun to blast away demons figure in God's plan? I see absolutely no constructive Christian purpose for playing this game, nothing good at all can come from this, it should be avoided at all costs and so too should its sequels which are far worse! (Doom is quite mild compared to some of the recent offerings from ID - Doom II, Quake etc and of course Quake 3 which I would utterly condemn! My Ratings: [1/3]</div><br /><br />And this little gem:<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Christian Rating: There hasn’t been a game that I would more than happily throw away after I just purchased it for fifty-five dollars than this one. The graphics are superb and sound is just down right awesome, but nothing will make up for the complete satanic feel and exposure this game will bring. As a twenty-one year old I have to say I was freaked out, disturbed, and horrified by Doom III’s content. I can’t imagine what a thirteen year old would feel like. After hours of exposure to this game, I could see a child’s attitude and personality change because of this game. I would have displayed more images but due to the graphic and satanic nature of this game I just couldn’t show it. Stay far away from Doom III it has no value to it at all. <span style="font-weight: bold">I would highly recommend that anyone who professes themselves to be Christians, to NOT PLAY THIS GAME.</span><br /><br />Conclusion: Rating: 0 out of 5 due to high levels of occult images and sounds, massive gore, and terrifying exposure to hell and demons. No game has gone so far as Doom III.</div><br /><br />And this guy claims that ID made D3 to promote Satanism (Because all we do is hug demons in this game).<br /><div class="quotetitle">http://www.christianforums.com/t1437385/ wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I don't agree with such games.

True, we should take a stand against the kingdom of darkness as children of light but the weapons we should use are not those of this world - where does using a shotgun to blast away demons figure in God's plan? I see absolutely no constructive Christian purpose for playing this game, nothing good at all can come from this, it should be avoided at all costs and so too should its sequels which are far worse! (Doom is quite mild compared to some of the recent offerings from ID - Doom II, Quake etc and of course Quake 3 which I would utterly condemn! My Ratings: [1/3]</div><br /><br />And this little gem:<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Christian Rating: There hasn’t been a game that I would more than happily throw away after I just purchased it for fifty-five dollars than this one. The graphics are superb and sound is just down right awesome, but nothing will make up for the complete satanic feel and exposure this game will bring. As a twenty-one year old I have to say I was freaked out, disturbed, and horrified by Doom III’s content. I can’t imagine what a thirteen year old would feel like. After hours of exposure to this game, I could see a child’s attitude and personality change because of this game. I would have displayed more images but due to the graphic and satanic nature of this game I just couldn’t show it. Stay far away from Doom III it has no value to it at all. <span style="font-weight: bold">I would highly recommend that anyone who professes themselves to be Christians, to NOT PLAY THIS GAME.</span><br /><br />Conclusion: Rating: 0 out of 5 due to high levels of occult images and sounds, massive gore, and terrifying exposure to hell and demons. No game has gone so far as Doom III.</div><br /><br />And this guy claims that ID made D3 to promote Satanism (Because all we do is hug demons in this game).<br /><div class="quotetitle">http://www.christianforums.com/t1437385/ wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I don't agree with such games.

All that seems to matter with this game is the cool campaign; I just don't see the point in trying to adjust things in MP when it's hardly going to make it more popular.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">=FF=Sturm wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">geX wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Heh the "broken" link gave me an idea. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320003324im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320003324im_/http://i338.photobucket.com/albums/n424/simonnjensen/af7ae6ff.png?t=1260472097" alt="Image" /></div><br />Excellent!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320003324im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /><br />My new signature</div><br />I kind of wonder, =FF=Sturm, why are you putting so much effort into stressing that you hate this game? You remind me of a bible-belter full of hot air. They go on and on about family values and purity, yet are caught with a hooker, a gay lover, and a dysfunctional family. Do you secretly like Wolf2K9? It's okay, you can be honest. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320003324im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p221024" date="Posted: Fri Dec 11, 2009 12:32 pm "><author>Burrito</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Wow, we reached religion with this thread.

True, we should take a stand against the kingdom of darkness as children of light but the weapons we should use are not those of this world - where does using a shotgun to blast away demons figure in God's plan? I see absolutely no constructive Christian purpose for playing this game, nothing good at all can come from this, it should be avoided at all costs and so too should its sequels which are far worse! (Doom is quite mild compared to some of the recent offerings from ID - Doom II, Quake etc and of course Quake 3 which I would utterly condemn! My Ratings: [1/3]</div><br /><br />And this little gem:<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Christian Rating: There hasn’t been a game that I would more than happily throw away after I just purchased it for fifty-five dollars than this one. The graphics are superb and sound is just down right awesome, but nothing will make up for the complete satanic feel and exposure this game will bring. As a twenty-one year old I have to say I was freaked out, disturbed, and horrified by Doom III’s content. I can’t imagine what a thirteen year old would feel like. After hours of exposure to this game, I could see a child’s attitude and personality change because of this game. I would have displayed more images but due to the graphic and satanic nature of this game I just couldn’t show it. Stay far away from Doom III it has no value to it at all. <span style="font-weight: bold">I would highly recommend that anyone who professes themselves to be Christians, to NOT PLAY THIS GAME.</span><br /><br />Conclusion: Rating: 0 out of 5 due to high levels of occult images and sounds, massive gore, and terrifying exposure to hell and demons. No game has gone so far as Doom III.</div><br /><br />And this guy claims that ID made D3 to promote Satanism (Because all we do is hug demons in this game).<br /><div class="quotetitle">http://www.christianforums.com/t1437385/ wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I don't agree with such games.
