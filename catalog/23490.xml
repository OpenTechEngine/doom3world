I am not really working on a mod yet but I was wondering if anyone would be interested in working on THE ROOM(S)? The basic idea is to make random rooms in doom 3 then from there we populate it with all kinds of static meshes and stuff.<br />I am new to 3D modelling but I have done some basic models. Now the idea would be to make a map and then someone sends a static mesh or mapobject that he wants anyone to use in a doom3 mod. The someone downloads THE ROOM and has the model and can run through the level looking at other models and use them in his mod if he wants.<br />Now I am talking any model. A coffee cup, cola can, car tyre or anything. But I am looking for finished models,fully textured,bumped,spec and high detail(Higher poly dan doom3). I have already begun with a few small models myself so I will hopefully have something to show soon.<br /><br />This idea is open for anything.<br />TEXTURES<br />SOUNDS<br />MODELS<br />SCRIPTING<br />ANYTHING<br /><br />But it has to be your own creation and you have to be willing to let someone use it in their mods.<br /><br />Ok let me know what you guys think?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p222585" date="Posted: Tue Feb 16, 2010 11:25 pm "><author>slush_puppy</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Hello Everyone  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225105318im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />Well I was not sure where to put this but this might be the place.
