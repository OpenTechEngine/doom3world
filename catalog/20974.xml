I guess the only other catch is to be able to have an origin which is parent to all bones, but that's hardly a real problem I'd say, even using Biped or CAT... or anything else for that matter.<br /><br />EDIT: Forgot to say that it does work in Max9. I assume it's der_ton's exporter?. I can't speak for another one.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p193073" date="Posted: Sun Dec 23, 2007 6:58 pm "><author>tobycraftse</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">are you sure it won't work with max 9.0?<br /><br />I tried export an "Arm object" seem working.<br /><br />using exporter to export to MD5 in max 9.0<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="/web/20071227193745/http://www.oniva.com/upload/1356/3ds.jpg">http://www.oniva.com/upload/1356/3ds.jpg</a><!-- m --><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="/web/20071227193745/http://www.oniva.com/upload/1356/3ds2.jpg">http://www.oniva.com/upload/1356/3ds2.jpg</a><!-- m --><br /><br />in MD5viewer, the "arm model" is showing up fine<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="/web/20071227193745/http://www.oniva.com/upload/1356/view.jpg">http://www.oniva.com/upload/1356/view.jpg</a><!-- m --><br /><br />P.S. used der_ton's exporter ( thanks for the cool tool ! )</div>]]></body></post><post id="p193096" date="Posted: Mon Dec 24, 2007 6:57 am "><author>obihb</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Yeah, as I said, it "does" work with Max9.</div>]]></body></post></posts></thread></xml>
