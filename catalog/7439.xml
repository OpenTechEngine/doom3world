<br /><br />The presence of broken sound shaders in the Editor's sound selection dialog was nagging me, especially the useless clutter it created, however mild. So I decided to clean those up too <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />============================
<br /><br />This pk4 file contains cleaned up .sndshd sound shader files in which all the broken sound shaders (shaders which refer to inexistent sound files) were commented out. 
<br /><br />Putting this PAK file in your /base folder has the positive effect of preventing those broken shaders from appearing in the sound shader list of the Editor's sound selection dialog therefore alleviating the confusion as to which ones work and which ones don't (without having to try to Play each and every one in the list to find out). 
<br /><br />Make sure you also download my latest Clean Defs PAK (also available for download from PC Gamemods - link below) since it contains the cleaned up sound shaders for the Sentry character (char_sentry.def). You need both pk4 files for a completely clean sound shader list in the editor.
