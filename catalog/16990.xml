<br /><br />*edit*
<br /><br />i think that letter actually reads:
<br /><br />"we'd like you to give us more money, so we can research how to control the masses, which is profitable"
<br /><br />what creeps me out is the fact that this letter is to the commerce committee and the <span style="font-style: italic">military affairs</span> committee.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p155083" date="Posted: Sun Aug 27, 2006 11:35 am "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">makc wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">This is exact invasion date, Nov 15, 2145.

<br /><br />it's not that it is hard to figure out. for example, all new emails player receives in 1st level are dated nov 15. but all it sais in pda is "date". it could be email creation date, for example. email in question clearly states that it was created after player (you) was given weapons, that is few minutes before you read it.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p155265" date="Posted: Tue Aug 29, 2006 11:22 am "><author>makc</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">

<br /><br />Umm id have been doing easter eggs for ages!
<br /><br />Doom 2: Wolf maps and Commander Keen, Romeros head on the stake, and the message the final boss says backwards: "To win the game, you must beat me, John Romero."
<br />Quake: Dopefish, Credits room, etc
<br />QUake 2: Hall of developers, the strogg pimp, rubber duck, "design is law" message ¬_¬
<br />Quake 3: John Carmacks head lying in the corner of DM15, Dopefish again, some fuzzy looking thing in DM19... and you can insult the bots if you keep talking to them long enough.
<br />Doom 3: The id pda at the end of the game. 
<br /><br />Probably some more in there, but I can't remember <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Z</div>]]></body></post><post id="p155280" date="Posted: Tue Aug 29, 2006 2:24 pm "><author>pbmax</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">your sarcasm detector needs a tune up.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p155289" date="Posted: Tue Aug 29, 2006 5:22 pm "><author>Zombie13</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">That was sarcasm?

I was used to the normal small-scale type easter eggs, but not anything utterly big and secret worked into the game and the player never notices. For example, something big like the Cortana letters in halo.
