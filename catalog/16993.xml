If you use HI solvers and just simple link the end effctor to the dummy, you shouldn't have problems.&#13;
<br/><br/>
From the bones I see it seems you don't have the origin down on the ground. You should put it there because Doom use the origin to place the model on the ground. This of course only counts for an AI character. If this is merely for a cinematic, then don't bother.&#13;
<br/><br/>
But about the IK again, I'm really not sure in what situation it will not work. The exporter doesn't really care how the bone moves, as long as it moves.&#13;

Here's a link to the max file. I've redone the bones again but its basically the same as before. It still dosen't work by the way.&#13;

There are no dummy objects but the ik chains are set up. Even when simply animating ik the animation for the bones still fails to export with der tons md5 export.&#13;

No, you can't do that. You have to select the mesh alone. The bones are linked to the mesh, so they will follow anyway. But if you select them you will get an error.<br/>_________________<br/>D3: Phobos&#13;

So, i'm not sure what you're doing. If you got the thing working in the game without IK, and now it does not work with IK. Doesn't make complete sense. You must be doing something else wrong somewhere.&#13;

So just doing this you can test it to make sure it works.&#13;
<br/><br/>
You may have some problems with the "origin" because you have the origin set as the pelvic bone. What you should do is add another bone, rename the origin you have to pelvis, link the pelvis to the new bone and name this new bone origin.&#13;
<br/><br/>
So you'll have the origin as a parent to all bones but also not influencing the animation in any way. The origin should just sit there with no animation on it. You can't use it as a pelvic bone.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="/web/20061013055928/http://home.telkomsa.net/obihb" target="_blank" class="postlink">Obi-Wan</a></span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

Do you mean create a new bone sepereately from the skeleton and then use the link button to attach it to the model.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Would this not bring up an error saying "too many root nodes attached to model, only one permitted". &#13;
<br/><br/>
I'll try anyway, also just to be sure, there is only one version of derton's md5 export?&#13;
<br/><br/>
Could you send me the md5 files exported with the model you tested to compare the files exported when i run the script, just to see if there are any obvious differences?</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

This new one you posted also works.&#13;

About the exporter, I know there are 2 different ones. One of them does extra stuff like automatically add bones to a mesh that is morphed, stuff like that. I use the normal one, the one that just purely exports skinned meshes.&#13;
<br/><br/>
I know the other one does have some problems. I remember somebody else had a problem with it but it was completely unrelated to this. It was about running out of memory.&#13;

This way you can take a look at the md5 files without writing any def files, eliminating the possibility of mistakes there.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Some short technical explanation about the md5exporter: The exporter only reads the positions of the bone objects frame by frame. You can use any method of animation available to you in 3dsmax to animate your rig, the only critical point is that the bone obects (the ones that are declared as the skeleton in the mesh object's skin modifier) are affected by your method of animation. So everything from directly keyframing the bone objects to indirectly affecting them with complicated IK or expression-based constraint or any animation-related plugins that you might use should work. As long as the method in the end results in animating the objects that are declared as "bones" in its skin modifier.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="/web/20061013055928/http://www.doom3world.org/" target="_blank" class="postlink"><img src="/web/20061013055928im_/http://www.doom3world.org/site/img/d3w.gif" border="0"/> Staff</a>&#13;

You may have some problems with the "origin" because you have the origin set as the pelvic bone. What you should do is add another bone, rename the origin you have to pelvis, link the pelvis to the new bone and name this new bone origin.&#13;
<br/><br/>
So you'll have the origin as a parent to all bones but also not influencing the animation in any way. The origin should just sit there with no animation on it. You can't use it as a pelvic bone.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="/web/20061013061242/http://home.telkomsa.net/obihb" target="_blank" class="postlink">Obi-Wan</a></span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

<br/><br/>
Do you mean create a new bone sepereately from the skeleton and then use the link button to attach it to the model.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Would this not bring up an error saying "too many root nodes attached to model, only one permitted". &#13;
<br/><br/>
I'll try anyway, also just to be sure, there is only one version of derton's md5 export?&#13;
<br/><br/>
Could you send me the md5 files exported with the model you tested to compare the files exported when i run the script, just to see if there are any obvious differences?</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

<br/><br/>
When i export the anim and check the .ASE file there is no data for the frames where there was data for the directly animated bone. &#13;
<br/><br/>
Here's the new file without the animated bones just animated IK. &#13;

<br/><br/>
This new one you posted also works.&#13;
<br/><br/>
About the exporter, I know there are 2 different ones. One of them does extra stuff like automatically add bones to a mesh that is morphed, stuff like that. I use the normal one, the one that just purely exports skinned meshes.&#13;
<br/><br/>
I know the other one does have some problems. I remember somebody else had a problem with it but it was completely unrelated to this. It was about running out of memory.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Anyway, here's what I exported and it does work.&#13;

<br/><br/>
Just check the material in the MD5Mesh, I changed it to work for me.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="/web/20061013061242/http://home.telkomsa.net/obihb" target="_blank" class="postlink">Obi-Wan</a></span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

This way you can take a look at the md5 files without writing any def files, eliminating the possibility of mistakes there.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Some short technical explanation about the md5exporter: The exporter only reads the positions of the bone objects frame by frame. You can use any method of animation available to you in 3dsmax to animate your rig, the only critical point is that the bone obects (the ones that are declared as the skeleton in the mesh object's skin modifier) are affected by your method of animation. So everything from directly keyframing the bone objects to indirectly affecting them with complicated IK or expression-based constraint or any animation-related plugins that you might use should work. As long as the method in the end results in animating the objects that are declared as "bones" in its skin modifier.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="/web/20061013061242/http://www.doom3world.org/" target="_blank" class="postlink"><img src="/web/20061013061242im_/http://www.doom3world.org/site/img/d3w.gif" border="0"/> Staff</a>&#13;

To be honest i don't know what the problem was, but im just glad to have overcome it. Again your suggestions and help was greatly appreciated!!!</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>
