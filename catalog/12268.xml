<br /><br />You can use any brush, or even different 3d objects to deform you model, but you have to use the projection master for that.
<br /><br />If you do, hmm what should I call it... Basic modelling, then you can only change different transform modes, such as inflate, pinch, smooth. As well as brush size and focal shift.
<br /><br />there is other ways to model too, using masks and the deform "operators" or box model. 
<br /><br />To explain the above would be to much in this post. I think you should find all this info in the Zscripted tutorials. If you still have questions, go ahead and ask for help. I don't say this becuase you shouldn't post your questions, but that the zscript probably teach you better than answers in a forum. 
<br /><br />One last tip,  Hold down CTRL while you mouse over any tool / button, that will show you a pop up tip that explains the use of that tool / button.

<br /><br />You can use any brush, or even different 3d objects to deform you model, but you have to use the projection master for that.
<br /><br />If you do, hmm what should I call it... Basic modelling, then you can only change different transform modes, such as inflate, pinch, smooth. As well as brush size and focal shift.
<br /><br />there is other ways to model too, using masks and the deform "operators" or box model. 
<br /><br />To explain the above would be to much in this post. I think you should find all this info in the Zscripted tutorials. If you still have questions, go ahead and ask for help. I don't say this becuase you shouldn't post your questions, but that the zscript probably teach you better than answers in a forum.
