<br /><br />I made this back in August last year when I was without internet so I couldn't make a WIP thread and... well, I explain it all on my website.
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Ultra Quality Issue</span>
<br />To reduce file size I'm only supplying the compressed versions of the diffuse/specular maps which the game ignores when in Ultra Quality mode. If you don't want to drop down to High Quality, type this on the console: "image_useprecompressedtextures 1" and reload the map.

<br /><br />Yes, but the engine only overrides declaration entry names, not declaration filenames. As an example for material entries, at start-up time, the engine loads a .mtr file, parses it, copying each material entry (and probably stripping out comments and so on) to its own internal material structure, then it discards the material file and goes on to the next. So you can have many material files all named "mymat.mtr" (in separate PK4 files of course) and not have any overridden materials because materials are only overridden when their material entry is the same.
<br /><br />P.S. This is only true for declarations. If you have two models, TGAs, or any other "physical" asset with the same path/filename then they'll override one another.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p179255" date="Posted: Tue May 29, 2007 2:21 am "><author>g0th</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Mordenkainen wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Please see if you have both the "atw2_data.pk4" and "atw2_maps.pk4" in the "q4base" folder.

<br /><br />A-ha! Thanks, now I know what the problem is. To reduce file size I compressed most diffusemaps and all specularmaps to DDS whislt leaving normalmaps uncompressed. In Ultra quality mode the game only tries to load uncompressed diffuse/normal/specular.
<br /><br />You can bypass it with "image_useprecompressedtextures 1". When setting Ultra quality, the game automatically sets this CVar to zero. Unfortunately, the only fix to this issue (that I know about) is putting in the uncompressed diffuse/specular maps; doing this would roughly double the download size.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081120191333im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><br /><br />Thanks g0th, I'll mention it in the first post/website.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p179301" date="Posted: Tue May 29, 2007 4:35 pm "><author>Hexen Terzo</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Mordenkainen wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">After the War 2 is sort of an homage to Hexen and Quake 1 with its medieval design and autumn motif but it is set during the Strogg invasion of Earth around 2065.

<br /><br />Well, the engine doesn't care about the filenames of material files (or any other declaration filetype) only the actual material entries need to be unique.

<br /><br />Yes, but the engine only overrides declaration entry names, not declaration filenames. As an example for material entries, at start-up time, the engine loads a .mtr file, parses it, copying each material entry (and probably stripping out comments and so on) to its own internal material structure, then it discards the material file and goes on to the next. So you can have many material files all named "mymat.mtr" (in separate PK4 files of course) and not have any overridden materials because materials are only overridden when their material entry is the same.
<br /><br />P.S. This is only true for declarations. If you have two models, TGAs, or any other "physical" asset with the same path/filename then they'll override one another.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p179255" date="Posted: Tue May 29, 2007 2:21 am "><author>g0th</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Mordenkainen wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><br />Please see if you have both the "atw2_data.pk4" and "atw2_maps.pk4" in the "q4base" folder.

<br /><br />I double checked that both pk4s were in the right place before i posted about it.

<br /><br />A-ha! Thanks, now I know what the problem is. To reduce file size I compressed most diffusemaps and all specularmaps to DDS whislt leaving normalmaps uncompressed. In Ultra quality mode the game only tries to load uncompressed diffuse/normal/specular.
<br /><br />You can bypass it with "image_useprecompressedtextures 1". When setting Ultra quality, the game automatically sets this CVar to zero. Unfortunately, the only fix to this issue (that I know about) is putting in the uncompressed diffuse/specular maps; doing this would roughly double the download size.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081120192829im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><br /><br />Thanks g0th, I'll mention it in the first post/website.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p179301" date="Posted: Tue May 29, 2007 4:35 pm "><author>Hexen Terzo</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Mordenkainen wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">After the War 2 is sort of an homage to Hexen and Quake 1 with its medieval design and autumn motif but it is set during the Strogg invasion of Earth around 2065.
