OpenGL was supposed to go fully object-oriented  and add craploads of new DX10-era functionality alongside an API rewrite. Hell, you can think of it <span style="font-style: italic">as</span> the DX10 of OpenGL. What we got was a handful of new features that were being mulled around a while back, such as instancing. All really old-school stuff.<br /><br />For all the consumer bitching about it, most if not all the academic and development sectors have a very positive opinion of Microsoft's revision to DX and I think the OGL nuts wanted a piece of the pie. [sidenote]Give it (DX10) time, people, the performance is there. We just need some research done into developing algorithms capable of taking full advantage of the new design.[/sidenote]<br /><br />I think it's also interesting to point out that ATi did a lot of the design for DX10 along with Microsoft.

There's a few brave souls inside ATI that care about OGL but if it was up to the "man", even their professional line of cards would have moved to DX yesterday.<br /><br />As a developer I can't blame them: supporting two competing standards for the same thing is redundant work, especially once D3D came of age with DX9. OGL just carries a lot of baggage, both technically and logistically. In ATI's dream world, supporting only D3D would mean no more redundancy, and no more linux/Mac 3D acceleration.<br /><br />(though, ATI has for some time moved its "2D desktop rendering" to its full 3D renderer - which leads to a simplified driver but worse thermal chip performance)</div>]]></body></post><post id="p206651" date="Posted: Mon Oct 27, 2008 6:19 pm "><author>The Happy Friar</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I'd say more interesting then ATI working with MS (it's stupid not to: why NOT work with groups developing a standard so you can support it better?), why didn't Nvidia work hard with the OGL group to make OGL 3 BETTER then DX10.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p207298" date="Posted: Fri Nov 07, 2008 5:30 pm "><author>aardwolf</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Well, ATI has released i think since this year thousands of pages of documentation of their drivers to the open source free software community so that they can write free open drivers for their cards.
