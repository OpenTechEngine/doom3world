Since then, whenever I go into DoomEdit and make a common brush, it will look all glitchy and messed up in 3D mode (they vanish or look all blurry). Same goes for entities and everything else to. This makes it very hard for me to make maps. So I'm wondering, is there anyway to fix this, like a setting or something?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p192456" date="Posted: Wed Dec 12, 2007 1:15 pm "><author>Jack Rammsdell</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I had a problem with that card as well, I had a geforce 6200 128mb, awhile back and when I first started up the editor things were rendered improperly and until I went into realtime render mode and went back to standard view, it would correct iteself.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p192471" date="Posted: Wed Dec 12, 2007 10:45 pm "><author>doomer145</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Yeah, that does fix it.
