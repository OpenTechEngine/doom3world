The author managed to make him in a way that he not only doesn't react to the player, but also doesn't move. In the centre of the room a black cube flies, which seem to be a gasbag monster without the model.<br /><br />After solving the puzzle about reaching the portal, I found myself in the Mario themed place, and couldn't find a way to advance. There are few portals, but they lead to the same room. With noclip, I found a forest with two portals, but one of them don't lead anywhere, another leads back to the maze.<br /><br />The quantity of fun is 0. Zero. No interesting architecture, no story and scripted scenes, no fun and/or original battle situations.<br /><br />But when you were creating this map, you were gaining experience with the editor. Don't be upset, because everyone creates such poor quality maps at the beginning. Continue gaining experience, and someday a breakthrough will happen, and you will make us happy with a masterpiece map.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p244193" date="Posted: Tue Nov 13, 2012 4:58 pm "><author>bkt</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Don't get too discouraged by poor responses to your first levels.
