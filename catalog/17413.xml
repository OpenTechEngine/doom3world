<br/><br/>
got to thinking last night and figured I should share theese two tips&#13;
<br/><br/>
1. if you find a bunch of old photo shop filters that dont work with newer versions&#13;
<br/>
download&#13;
<br/>
MSVCRT10.DLL&#13;
<br/>
its as simple as googling a place to download it.  Place the dill in your windows system32 folder and your filter should now work&#13;
<br/><br/>
2.  If your  a long time gimp user like me  but want ""Some"" photoshop filters to playwith as well&#13;
<br/>
download pspi.exe for gimp&#13;
<br/>
place pspi in your gimp plugins folder&#13;
<br/>
now restart the gimp  there will be a nother entry in your menus that will allow you to point pspi  to your photoshop plugins folder&#13;
<br/>
warning not all plugins work but quite a few do&#13;
<br/><br/>
I know the other day someone mentioned &#13;
<br/><a href="/web/20061013023508/http://www.artweaver.de/index.php?en_version" target="_blank">http://www.artweaver.de/index.php?en_version</a>  artweaver as a free paint program as well&#13;
<br/>

<br/><a href="/web/20061013023508/http://www.getpaint.net/" target="_blank">http://www.getpaint.net/</a>  (requires net2.0)&#13;
<br/><br/>
and a fun one is gloodle&#13;
<br/><br/>
one last tip since I started playing with gimp and photoshop together I sometimes want to take the picture between the 2 programs&#13;
<br/>
gimp is happy to import photoshop's clippboard stuff but photoshop dosnt like the gimp's&#13;
<br/>
quick and easy way around this&#13;
