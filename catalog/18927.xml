<br /><br />The ornaments look easy. The harder part that I see is that really neat patterned cylinder that's in the archway in the top area of the windows (the upside-down "U" shaped thing). Everything else looks pretty simple, but still very well done.
<br /><br />I always love it when people import models into Doom 3 for map editing, it's SO much better than those blocky brushes that the Radiant editor makes. But I have seen a lot of people make some really neat looking things with those brushes!
<br /><br />I still prefer neat imports <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p172554" date="Posted: Fri Mar 09, 2007 10:35 am "><author>Lumpengnom</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Looks good.

<br /><br />@mikebart- using modo, will try to work in some mudbox
<br /><br />The cylinder started out straight with 8 lengthwise edges and 22 segments. I pulled the lengthwise edges up and down to make the zig-zags in the segment edges. Then I beveled the zig-zags to make the cuts. I used the bend deformer to turn it into a half circle, then attached two straight segments to the ends to make a U. It's a sub-d model, so I can get away with fewer edges and still get round (at least until I'm done).
<br /><br />I didn't get the spacing quite right, so they look a litle busy- if i get the nerve to redo them I'll take some screens along the way.

<br /><br />I think the bricks need a sharper normalmap, Id suggest projecting it from a high poly model and give it some variation, I imagine you're going to be doing alot of projecting anyway with the scrolling ornaments.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p173153" date="Posted: Fri Mar 16, 2007 2:25 am "><author>parsonsbear</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">The bricks did get projected from geom, but the bevels need to be tighter, also got pulled into a sculpter and blurred them with a smooth brush while stamping, just playing around.

<br /><br />The reflections across the icier, packed down parts of the path would be cool. I saw ATI's 'Toyshop' demo at Siggraph last year and it was bananas with that stuff.

It's a telescope, but a newer/smaller design than the others I'm working on. I had to put a screen up just so i could call it a night on the thing. It's been a, uh, learning experience.  It looks very different ingame from the modeling app. Texture resolution is killing me too- I want to put lots of details into models, but a too high res bumpmap often gets blurry when viewed from far away, and compressed/jaggy looking when close up.

<br /><br />I dont know what you've got planned for the sky but I think you could make it a bit more interesting, perhaps a higher resolution skybox? or maybe you could replace the skybox with an inverted sphere and have it slowly rotate on 2 axis 
<br />(did you mention earlier the stars were accurate?)

<br /><br />the skybox is a pregenerated  and correct for that lattitude and longitude, but the date is sometime ago. I've done tests with portalsky setups for drawing grids and stars, and will probably move over to that. I'm really into the batching topic going on right now, because the visible star count exceeds the max entity count, so if i'm generating accurate skies on the fly i need to take that into account. Either that or some kind of pixel shader for the stars.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p172385" date="Posted: Wed Mar 07, 2007 9:07 pm "><author>parsonsbear</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">new screenshot of the southbuilding:

<br /><br />The ornaments look easy. The harder part that I see is that really neat patterned cylinder that's in the archway in the top area of the windows (the upside-down "U" shaped thing). Everything else looks pretty simple, but still very well done.
<br /><br />I always love it when people import models into Doom 3 for map editing, it's SO much better than those blocky brushes that the Radiant editor makes. But I have seen a lot of people make some really neat looking things with those brushes!
<br /><br />I still prefer neat imports <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225084701im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p172554" date="Posted: Fri Mar 09, 2007 11:35 am "><author>Lumpengnom</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Looks good.

<br /><br />@mikebart- using modo, will try to work in some mudbox
<br /><br />The cylinder started out straight with 8 lengthwise edges and 22 segments. I pulled the lengthwise edges up and down to make the zig-zags in the segment edges. Then I beveled the zig-zags to make the cuts. I used the bend deformer to turn it into a half circle, then attached two straight segments to the ends to make a U. It's a sub-d model, so I can get away with fewer edges and still get round (at least until I'm done).
<br /><br />I didn't get the spacing quite right, so they look a litle busy- if i get the nerve to redo them I'll take some screens along the way.

<br /><br />The ornamental stuff is the main building, this is kinda like the shed. I'm doing this one first to get a feel for texture scale and in-game proportions. I can iterate over this one a lot quicker than the heavy one. The tower wall texture is giving me trouble- It's like a stucco, and the map is a lot more detailed than that, but it gets all blurry as you move away from it. I'll post images of the texture and some screens to illustrate later. The bricks are really tiling poorly, need better bump.

<br /><br />The ornaments look easy. The harder part that I see is that really neat patterned cylinder that's in the archway in the top area of the windows (the upside-down "U" shaped thing). Everything else looks pretty simple, but still very well done.
<br /><br />I always love it when people import models into Doom 3 for map editing, it's SO much better than those blocky brushes that the Radiant editor makes. But I have seen a lot of people make some really neat looking things with those brushes!
<br /><br />I still prefer neat imports <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225084701im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p172554" date="Posted: Fri Mar 09, 2007 11:35 am "><author>Lumpengnom</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Looks good.

<br /><br />@mikebart- using modo, will try to work in some mudbox
<br /><br />The cylinder started out straight with 8 lengthwise edges and 22 segments. I pulled the lengthwise edges up and down to make the zig-zags in the segment edges. Then I beveled the zig-zags to make the cuts. I used the bend deformer to turn it into a half circle, then attached two straight segments to the ends to make a U. It's a sub-d model, so I can get away with fewer edges and still get round (at least until I'm done).
<br /><br />I didn't get the spacing quite right, so they look a litle busy- if i get the nerve to redo them I'll take some screens along the way.

<br /><br />I used alpha channelled geometry projected from the high poly models for the small details of the ornament on my low poly model just to get the shape of the edges without puting too many polys into it, but I think your column will project quite nicely as long as you fill the void.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p172612" date="Posted: Sat Mar 10, 2007 2:38 am "><author>Dinky</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">parsonsbear wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Does anyone know what the max texture size d3 allows?

<br /><br />The ornamental stuff is the main building, this is kinda like the shed. I'm doing this one first to get a feel for texture scale and in-game proportions. I can iterate over this one a lot quicker than the heavy one. The tower wall texture is giving me trouble- It's like a stucco, and the map is a lot more detailed than that, but it gets all blurry as you move away from it. I'll post images of the texture and some screens to illustrate later. The bricks are really tiling poorly, need better bump.
<br /><br />At this point I'm probably going to start over on it to fix a lot of the mistakes I made along the way. I have a better idea of how i need to deviate from reference to get the most out of the engine, as d3 is going to require a specific look- umm, dark. Not that it can't do lit, but it just looks really good with the lights off and the flashlight under it's face, so to speak.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p173143" date="Posted: Fri Mar 16, 2007 1:18 am "><author>mikebart</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">yeah you've definitly done a nice job of setting it up for a night scene, just one other thing I noticed this morning is the alpha planes on the trees dont look very cleen it looks like you painted the alphachannel with an airbrush, but im sure you're aware of them, you could probably get away them being all modeled.
<br /><br />I think the bricks need a sharper normalmap, Id suggest projecting it from a high poly model and give it some variation, I imagine you're going to be doing alot of projecting anyway with the scrolling ornaments.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p173153" date="Posted: Fri Mar 16, 2007 2:25 am "><author>parsonsbear</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">The bricks did get projected from geom, but the bevels need to be tighter, also got pulled into a sculpter and blurred them with a smooth brush while stamping, just playing around. 
<br /><br />The alphas on the trees are a lot sharper than that, but they get downsampled at distance so they turn blurry- for these, the geom is probably enough, but that won't work for the pines.

<br /><br />The reflections across the icier, packed down parts of the path would be cool. I saw ATI's 'Toyshop' demo at Siggraph last year and it was bananas with that stuff.

It looks very different ingame from the modeling app. Texture resolution is killing me too- I want to put lots of details into models, but a too high res bumpmap often gets blurry when viewed from far away, and compressed/jaggy looking when close up.

<br /><br />I dont know what you've got planned for the sky but I think you could make it a bit more interesting, perhaps a higher resolution skybox? or maybe you could replace the skybox with an inverted sphere and have it slowly rotate on 2 axis 
<br />(did you mention earlier the stars were accurate?)

<br /><br />the skybox is a pregenerated  and correct for that lattitude and longitude, but the date is sometime ago. I've done tests with portalsky setups for drawing grids and stars, and will probably move over to that. I'm really into the batching topic going on right now, because the visible star count exceeds the max entity count, so if i'm generating accurate skies on the fly i need to take that into account.

<br /><br />The cylinder started out straight with 8 lengthwise edges and 22 segments. I pulled the lengthwise edges up and down to make the zig-zags in the segment edges. Then I beveled the zig-zags to make the cuts. I used the bend deformer to turn it into a half circle, then attached two straight segments to the ends to make a U.

Then I beveled the zig-zags to make the cuts. I used the bend deformer to turn it into a half circle, then attached two straight segments to the ends to make a U. It's a sub-d model, so I can get away with fewer edges and still get round (at least until I'm done).
<br /><br />I didn't get the spacing quite right, so they look a litle busy- if i get the nerve to redo them I'll take some screens along the way.

<br /><br />The ornaments look easy. The harder part that I see is that really neat patterned cylinder that's in the archway in the top area of the windows (the upside-down "U" shaped thing). Everything else looks pretty simple, but still very well done.

<br /><br />The cylinder started out straight with 8 lengthwise edges and 22 segments. I pulled the lengthwise edges up and down to make the zig-zags in the segment edges. Then I beveled the zig-zags to make the cuts. I used the bend deformer to turn it into a half circle, then attached two straight segments to the ends to make a U.

<br /><br />The ornaments look easy. The harder part that I see is that really neat patterned cylinder that's in the archway in the top area of the windows (the upside-down "U" shaped thing). Everything else looks pretty simple, but still very well done.

<br /><br />The cylinder started out straight with 8 lengthwise edges and 22 segments. I pulled the lengthwise edges up and down to make the zig-zags in the segment edges. Then I beveled the zig-zags to make the cuts. I used the bend deformer to turn it into a half circle, then attached two straight segments to the ends to make a U.

<br /><br />The ornaments look easy. The harder part that I see is that really neat patterned cylinder that's in the archway in the top area of the windows (the upside-down "U" shaped thing). Everything else looks pretty simple, but still very well done.
<br /><br />I always love it when people import models into Doom 3 for map editing, it's SO much better than those blocky brushes that the Radiant editor makes. But I have seen a lot of people make some really neat looking things with those brushes!
<br /><br />I still prefer neat imports <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p172554" date="Posted: Fri Mar 09, 2007 10:35 am "><author>Lumpengnom</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Looks good.

<br /><br />@mikebart- using modo, will try to work in some mudbox
<br /><br />The cylinder started out straight with 8 lengthwise edges and 22 segments. I pulled the lengthwise edges up and down to make the zig-zags in the segment edges. Then I beveled the zig-zags to make the cuts. I used the bend deformer to turn it into a half circle, then attached two straight segments to the ends to make a U. It's a sub-d model, so I can get away with fewer edges and still get round (at least until I'm done).
<br /><br />I didn't get the spacing quite right, so they look a litle busy- if i get the nerve to redo them I'll take some screens along the way.

<br /><br />I used alpha channelled geometry projected from the high poly models for the small details of the ornament on my low poly model just to get the shape of the edges without puting too many polys into it, but I think your column will project quite nicely as long as you fill the void.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p172612" date="Posted: Sat Mar 10, 2007 1:38 am "><author>Dinky</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">parsonsbear wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Does anyone know what the max texture size d3 allows?

<br /><br />I think 1024x1024 is the max. It can also accept 256x256 and 512x512.

<br /><br />The ornaments look easy. The harder part that I see is that really neat patterned cylinder that's in the archway in the top area of the windows (the upside-down "U" shaped thing). Everything else looks pretty simple, but still very well done.

<br /><br />The cylinder started out straight with 8 lengthwise edges and 22 segments. I pulled the lengthwise edges up and down to make the zig-zags in the segment edges. Then I beveled the zig-zags to make the cuts. I used the bend deformer to turn it into a half circle, then attached two straight segments to the ends to make a U.

<br /><br />I didn't get the spacing quite right, so they look a litle busy- if i get the nerve to redo them I'll take some screens along the way.

Then I beveled the zig-zags to make the cuts. I used the bend deformer to turn it into a half circle, then attached two straight segments to the ends to make a U. It's a sub-d model, so I can get away with fewer edges and still get round (at least until I'm done).
<br /><br />I didn't get the spacing quite right, so they look a litle busy- if i get the nerve to redo them I'll take some screens along the way.

<br /><br />The cylinder started out straight with 8 lengthwise edges and 22 segments. I pulled the lengthwise edges up and down to make the zig-zags in the segment edges. Then I beveled the zig-zags to make the cuts. I used the bend deformer to turn it into a half circle, then attached two straight segments to the ends to make a U. It's a sub-d model, so I can get away with fewer edges and still get round (at least until I'm done).

<br /><br />The ornaments look easy. The harder part that I see is that really neat patterned cylinder that's in the archway in the top area of the windows (the upside-down "U" shaped thing). Everything else looks pretty simple, but still very well done.
<br /><br />I always love it when people import models into Doom 3 for map editing, it's SO much better than those blocky brushes that the Radiant editor makes. But I have seen a lot of people make some really neat looking things with those brushes!
<br /><br />I still prefer neat imports <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p172554" date="Posted: Fri Mar 09, 2007 10:35 am "><author>Lumpengnom</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Looks good.

<br /><br />@mikebart- using modo, will try to work in some mudbox
<br /><br />The cylinder started out straight with 8 lengthwise edges and 22 segments. I pulled the lengthwise edges up and down to make the zig-zags in the segment edges. Then I beveled the zig-zags to make the cuts. I used the bend deformer to turn it into a half circle, then attached two straight segments to the ends to make a U. It's a sub-d model, so I can get away with fewer edges and still get round (at least until I'm done).
<br /><br />I didn't get the spacing quite right, so they look a litle busy- if i get the nerve to redo them I'll take some screens along the way.

<br /><br />I used alpha channelled geometry projected from the high poly models for the small details of the ornament on my low poly model just to get the shape of the edges without puting too many polys into it, but I think your column will project quite nicely as long as you fill the void.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p172612" date="Posted: Sat Mar 10, 2007 1:38 am "><author>Dinky</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">parsonsbear wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Does anyone know what the max texture size d3 allows?

Yeah, I've played around with using the photosource to generate heightmaps, as well as drawing them out in mudbox (i'm not very good at sculpting though) I think as I do more ornament I'll get a better feel for what's worth modeling.</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

<br/><br/>
The ornamental stuff is the main building, this is kinda like the shed. I'm doing this one first to get a feel for texture scale and in-game proportions. I can iterate over this one a lot quicker than the heavy one. The tower wall texture is giving me trouble- It's like a stucco, and the map is a lot more detailed than that, but it gets all blurry as you move away from it. I'll post images of the texture and some screens to illustrate later. The bricks are really tiling poorly, need better bump.&#13;
<br/><br/>
At this point I'm probably going to start over on it to fix a lot of the mistakes I made along the way. I have a better idea of how i need to deviate from reference to get the most out of the engine, as d3 is going to require a specific look- umm, dark. Not that it can't do lit, but it just looks really good with the lights off and the flashlight under it's face, so to speak.</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

I think the bricks need a sharper normalmap, Id suggest projecting it from a high poly model and give it some variation, I imagine you're going to be doing alot of projecting anyway with the scrolling ornaments.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?p=160978#160978" target="_blank" class="postlink">Tutorial; Baking Multiple Maps in 3dsmax8. </a></span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

The alphas on the trees are a lot sharper than that, but they get downsampled at distance so they turn blurry- for these, the geom is probably enough, but that won't work for the pines.&#13;

I'm definitely excited about the ground stuff, i think I can get some very megatexture looking effects foregoing the per-pixel lighting.&#13;

The reflections across the icier, packed down parts of the path would be cool. I saw ATI's 'Toyshop' demo at Siggraph last year and it was bananas with that stuff. I wish I had more time to get into the shader programming, but maybe i can fake it somehow.</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

The ornamental stuff is the main building, this is kinda like the shed. I'm doing this one first to get a feel for texture scale and in-game proportions. I can iterate over this one a lot quicker than the heavy one. The tower wall texture is giving me trouble- It's like a stucco, and the map is a lot more detailed than that, but it gets all blurry as you move away from it. I'll post images of the texture and some screens to illustrate later. The bricks are really tiling poorly, need better bump.&#13;
<br/><br/>
At this point I'm probably going to start over on it to fix a lot of the mistakes I made along the way. I have a better idea of how i need to deviate from reference to get the most out of the engine, as d3 is going to require a specific look- umm, dark. Not that it can't do lit, but it just looks really good with the lights off and the flashlight under it's face, so to speak.</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

I think the bricks need a sharper normalmap, Id suggest projecting it from a high poly model and give it some variation, I imagine you're going to be doing alot of projecting anyway with the scrolling ornaments.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?p=160978#160978" target="_blank" class="postlink">Tutorial; Baking Multiple Maps in 3dsmax8. </a></span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

If you're doing this for etqw the textures are probably good but if its for a portfolio project or something i'd crank the resolution up a bit.&#13;

where does the ornamental scrolling fit into those shots? is it a seperate building?<br/>_________________<br/><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?p=160978#160978" target="_blank" class="postlink">Tutorial; Baking Multiple Maps in 3dsmax8. </a></span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

<br/><br/>
The ornamental stuff is the main building, this is kinda like the shed. I'm doing this one first to get a feel for texture scale and in-game proportions. I can iterate over this one a lot quicker than the heavy one. The tower wall texture is giving me trouble- It's like a stucco, and the map is a lot more detailed than that, but it gets all blurry as you move away from it. I'll post images of the texture and some screens to illustrate later. The bricks are really tiling poorly, need better bump.&#13;
<br/><br/>
At this point I'm probably going to start over on it to fix a lot of the mistakes I made along the way. I have a better idea of how i need to deviate from reference to get the most out of the engine, as d3 is going to require a specific look- umm, dark. Not that it can't do lit, but it just looks really good with the lights off and the flashlight under it's face, so to speak.</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

<br/><br/>
I think the bricks need a sharper normalmap, Id suggest projecting it from a high poly model and give it some variation, I imagine you're going to be doing alot of projecting anyway with the scrolling ornaments.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?p=160978#160978" target="_blank" class="postlink">Tutorial; Baking Multiple Maps in 3dsmax8. </a></span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

The alphas on the trees are a lot sharper than that, but they get downsampled at distance so they turn blurry- for these, the geom is probably enough, but that won't work for the pines.&#13;

which of those trees are modelled and which are in the background. can you show some wires of that shot?&#13;

I'm definitely excited about the ground stuff, i think I can get some very megatexture looking effects foregoing the per-pixel lighting.&#13;
<br/><br/>
The reflections across the icier, packed down parts of the path would be cool. I saw ATI's 'Toyshop' demo at Siggraph last year and it was bananas with that stuff. I wish I had more time to get into the shader programming, but maybe i can fake it somehow.</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

yes.  certain cards do a certain max res.  I believe DX8 only goes up to 512x512.  Here's a website that will show the info:&#13;

The ornamental stuff is the main building, this is kinda like the shed. I'm doing this one first to get a feel for texture scale and in-game proportions. I can iterate over this one a lot quicker than the heavy one. The tower wall texture is giving me trouble- It's like a stucco, and the map is a lot more detailed than that, but it gets all blurry as you move away from it. I'll post images of the texture and some screens to illustrate later. The bricks are really tiling poorly, need better bump.&#13;
<br/><br/>
At this point I'm probably going to start over on it to fix a lot of the mistakes I made along the way. I have a better idea of how i need to deviate from reference to get the most out of the engine, as d3 is going to require a specific look- umm, dark. Not that it can't do lit, but it just looks really good with the lights off and the flashlight under it's face, so to speak.</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

<br/><br/>
I think the bricks need a sharper normalmap, Id suggest projecting it from a high poly model and give it some variation, I imagine you're going to be doing alot of projecting anyway with the scrolling ornaments.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?p=160978#160978" target="_blank" class="postlink">Tutorial; Baking Multiple Maps in 3dsmax8. </a></span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

The reflections across the icier, packed down parts of the path would be cool. I saw ATI's 'Toyshop' demo at Siggraph last year and it was bananas with that stuff. I wish I had more time to get into the shader programming, but maybe i can fake it somehow.</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

Yeah, I've played around with using the photosource to generate heightmaps, as well as drawing them out in mudbox (i'm not very good at sculpting though) I think as I do more ornament I'll get a better feel for what's worth modeling.</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

If you're doing this for etqw the textures are probably good but if its for a portfolio project or something i'd crank the resolution up a bit.&#13;

where does the ornamental scrolling fit into those shots? is it a seperate building?<br/>_________________<br/><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?p=160978#160978" target="_blank" class="postlink">Tutorial; Baking Multiple Maps in 3dsmax8. </a></span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

<br/><br/>
The ornamental stuff is the main building, this is kinda like the shed. I'm doing this one first to get a feel for texture scale and in-game proportions. I can iterate over this one a lot quicker than the heavy one. The tower wall texture is giving me trouble- It's like a stucco, and the map is a lot more detailed than that, but it gets all blurry as you move away from it. I'll post images of the texture and some screens to illustrate later. The bricks are really tiling poorly, need better bump.&#13;
<br/><br/>
At this point I'm probably going to start over on it to fix a lot of the mistakes I made along the way. I have a better idea of how i need to deviate from reference to get the most out of the engine, as d3 is going to require a specific look- umm, dark. Not that it can't do lit, but it just looks really good with the lights off and the flashlight under it's face, so to speak.</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

<br/><br/>
I think the bricks need a sharper normalmap, Id suggest projecting it from a high poly model and give it some variation, I imagine you're going to be doing alot of projecting anyway with the scrolling ornaments.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?p=160978#160978" target="_blank" class="postlink">Tutorial; Baking Multiple Maps in 3dsmax8. </a></span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

The alphas on the trees are a lot sharper than that, but they get downsampled at distance so they turn blurry- for these, the geom is probably enough, but that won't work for the pines.&#13;

I'm definitely excited about the ground stuff, i think I can get some very megatexture looking effects foregoing the per-pixel lighting.&#13;
<br/><br/>
The reflections across the icier, packed down parts of the path would be cool. I saw ATI's 'Toyshop' demo at Siggraph last year and it was bananas with that stuff. I wish I had more time to get into the shader programming, but maybe i can fake it somehow.</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

The ornamental stuff is the main building, this is kinda like the shed. I'm doing this one first to get a feel for texture scale and in-game proportions. I can iterate over this one a lot quicker than the heavy one. The tower wall texture is giving me trouble- It's like a stucco, and the map is a lot more detailed than that, but it gets all blurry as you move away from it. I'll post images of the texture and some screens to illustrate later. The bricks are really tiling poorly, need better bump.&#13;
<br/><br/>
At this point I'm probably going to start over on it to fix a lot of the mistakes I made along the way. I have a better idea of how i need to deviate from reference to get the most out of the engine, as d3 is going to require a specific look- umm, dark. Not that it can't do lit, but it just looks really good with the lights off and the flashlight under it's face, so to speak.</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

I think the bricks need a sharper normalmap, Id suggest projecting it from a high poly model and give it some variation, I imagine you're going to be doing alot of projecting anyway with the scrolling ornaments.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?p=160978#160978" target="_blank" class="postlink">Tutorial; Baking Multiple Maps in 3dsmax8. </a></span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

I'm definitely excited about the ground stuff, i think I can get some very megatexture looking effects foregoing the per-pixel lighting.&#13;

The reflections across the icier, packed down parts of the path would be cool. I saw ATI's 'Toyshop' demo at Siggraph last year and it was bananas with that stuff. I wish I had more time to get into the shader programming, but maybe i can fake it somehow.</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

I'm doing this one first to get a feel for texture scale and in-game proportions. I can iterate over this one a lot quicker than the heavy one. The tower wall texture is giving me trouble- It's like a stucco, and the map is a lot more detailed than that, but it gets all blurry as you move away from it. I'll post images of the texture and some screens to illustrate later. The bricks are really tiling poorly, need better bump.&#13;<br /><br />At this point I'm probably going to start over on it to fix a lot of the mistakes I made along the way.

It looks very different ingame from the modeling app. Texture resolution is killing me too- I want to put lots of details into models, but a too high res bumpmap often gets blurry when viewed from far away, and compressed/jaggy looking when close up.&#13;<br /><br />I'm going to make another pass at it soon, but i may put up a detailed list of these issues to try and get some help on it.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p175368" date="Posted: Fri Apr 06, 2007 9:22 pm "><author>parsonsbear</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">

The ornamental stuff is the main building, this is kinda like the shed. I'm doing this one first to get a feel for texture scale and in-game proportions. I can iterate over this one a lot quicker than the heavy one. The tower wall texture is giving me trouble- It's like a stucco, and the map is a lot more detailed than that, but it gets all blurry as you move away from it. I'll post images of the texture and some screens to illustrate later. The bricks are really tiling poorly, need better bump.&#13;
<br/><br/>
At this point I'm probably going to start over on it to fix a lot of the mistakes I made along the way. I have a better idea of how i need to deviate from reference to get the most out of the engine, as d3 is going to require a specific look- umm, dark. Not that it can't do lit, but it just looks really good with the lights off and the flashlight under it's face, so to speak.</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

I think the bricks need a sharper normalmap, Id suggest projecting it from a high poly model and give it some variation, I imagine you're going to be doing alot of projecting anyway with the scrolling ornaments.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?p=160978#160978" target="_blank" class="postlink">Tutorial; Baking Multiple Maps in 3dsmax8. </a></span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

I'm definitely excited about the ground stuff, i think I can get some very megatexture looking effects foregoing the per-pixel lighting.&#13;
