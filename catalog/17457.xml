Actually, both these keys are not working. The actual working keys are:<br /><br />projectile_debris<br />projectile_shrapnel<br /><br />BTW, check the debris_shrapnel, cause it doesn't work. debris_largeshrapnel, on the other hand, works.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">6th Venom wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">3) How to define disapear/fading time?

<br /><br />Check the entitydefs for debris_shrapnel. Fading/disappearing works same as that of debris_brass, debris_barrelpiece etc.
<br /><br />A small note: My upcoming mod's dll has fixed some issues which includes  working of above keys.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p159434" date="Posted: Thu Oct 12, 2006 8:39 pm "><author>6th Venom</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I played with "def_debris" and it seems to work fine...

<br /><br />When I was talking about def_debris and def_shrapnel, I was considering that you found them in projectileDefs. Since it's the only kind of entityDef where these keys are found together.
<br /><br />As far as def_debris key is concerned, it works for every entity which is of type idMoveable. It can be used to show that an object is broken when damaged.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p159449" date="Posted: Thu Oct 12, 2006 10:53 pm "><author>6th Venom</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">oki doki, thanks for info!</div>]]></body></post></posts></thread></xml>
