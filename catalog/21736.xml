Only 5-8. It just need an insane amount of polygons, to have a somewhat good effect.<br /><br />How do you proceed? What are your solution? Is there any way to get the double-side + aplha without sacrifying the shadows?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p201761" date="Posted: Sat Jul 12, 2008 5:56 pm "><author>Alternate</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">My best guess is that, you make the grass as REALLY low polied models. Like, 3 polies per grass. Doom 3 isn't really into foliage shadowing. Too sharp and dark. Don't forget to check the ambient fix on modifications board. That helps alot to make outdoor areas.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p201764" date="Posted: Sat Jul 12, 2008 6:39 pm "><author>ShaZe</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">hmmm, and what about Quake Wars.
