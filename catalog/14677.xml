<br />----------------------
<br /><br />Prefabs now total 118
<br /><br />Added 'Ancients Stuff' (lost civilization temple, excavation)
<br />Added most of the id game machinery, including Destabilizer and Hydrocon Generator <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320005944im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /><br />Added ready-made consoles with GUIs (very useful!)
<br />All prefabs should now be at Z point, Some were off center.
<br />Cleaned up some filenames, some confusing names fixed
<br />Aligned most prefabs to grid, aligned nearly all textures better.
<br /><br />NOTE: Nearly all of these prefabs are RECREATIONS made by me. The more complex ones were copied and pasted. Shouts to id software.
<br /><br />PLEASE READ THE INCLUDED README FILE!
<br /><br /><br />Prefabs worthy of particular mention:
<br />*************************************
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Elevator/Moth_TwoFloorGUI_NoScripting</span> -
<br />Two Floor Elevator with GUIs and properly-working doors  - <span style="font-style: italic">requires NO SCRIPTING!</span>

<br />Ive gotten alot of feedback on the tutorials for func_conveyor and escalators func_jumpad in vanilla doom 3 so I wipped up this pack with examples of theese and some new concepts plus examples from some of my tutorials
<br />for example
<br />how to use target_setinfluence
<br />func_phantomobjects
<br />and some reference crap
<br />there are some good ones mixed in and I will redo this pack later with some quality stuff and screens
<br />again I rushed it because of all the curisoity generated by those tutorials
<br /><br />Ust this and any of my other stuff however you want
<br />for the conveyor texture to show up right you will need to copy the def text from my tutorial on func_conveyors in doom3
<br />and create a new def of your own

<br /><br />Come on, V! Let's make this as pain-free as possible and not expect our end users to make new defs - do it for them, saves time later!

<br />----------------------
<br /><br />Prefabs now total 118
<br /><br />Added 'Ancients Stuff' (lost civilization temple, excavation)
<br />Added most of the id game machinery, including Destabilizer and Hydrocon Generator <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225005303im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /><br />Added ready-made consoles with GUIs (very useful!)
<br />All prefabs should now be at Z point, Some were off center.
<br />Cleaned up some filenames, some confusing names fixed
<br />Aligned most prefabs to grid, aligned nearly all textures better.
<br /><br />NOTE: Nearly all of these prefabs are RECREATIONS made by me. The more complex ones were copied and pasted. Shouts to id software.
<br /><br />PLEASE READ THE INCLUDED README FILE!
<br /><br /><br />Prefabs worthy of particular mention:

<br /><br />I found the file here, but it was awkward. There were several layers of links to follow, generally with deceptively similar links to unwanted crud nearby. The second-to-final download link also didn't work on one try -- like the first link in your post, all I got was a page with ad cruft on it and the "back" button wouldn't work. Going through the whole thing again did work however and I now have the file; thanks.
<br /><br />What is id Software's position on reuse of map geometry from their maps, by the way? I assume that copying whole rooms and similar is a no-no, at least without giving credit where due, but copying some of the common machinery, crates, elevators, doors (including airlocks), and so forth is pretty much gonna be necessary to make maps set in the UAC facility on Mars that look "authentic". So -- is anything id reused a lot themselves fair game for drop-in reuse, but things (like the EPD machinery) that only occur once in the stock maps not? That would seem to be a fair rule, but is it one id would agree with?
<br /><br />Another scenario, and an iffier one: you copy a whole room from an id map, which had windows into inaccessible areas. Only in your map, it's the id map room that is the inaccessible area, and gameplay takes place in the area that was inaccessible in the id map, and in adjoining wholly-original areas.
<br /><br />Now this was done (a LOT) with the original half-life without any problems arising, so far as I can see. (The number of clones of the Lambda teleporter room alone is astonishing, and one ended up occurring in the official expansion pack Opposing Force.) And often the reused room was playable (it was in op4), but the rest of the map was original (you'd leave and depart by different routes). But Valve is not id, so their policies could well differ on this type of reuse.
<br /><br />This sort of thing could add a lot of flavor to a map, by adding points of contact with the original storyline (as was done in op4). Would it probably be okay if it were a) credited, b) the rest was original, and c) there may or may not be changes (such as it's later in the invasion than when the original game's player character saw the area, and growths and pentagrams have appeared in the area that weren't there before (aren't in the id map), or vice versa)... Examples would include things like, say, Betruger's office and immediate environs prior to time when the growths appeared that are in the admin map; or the entry lounge seen from one of the inaccessible (in the original game) side areas, looking the same but unreachable.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p150865" date="Posted: Mon Jul 24, 2006 5:16 am "><author>Twisted0n3</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Eh -- I don't see some basic prefabs like single chairs, tables, <span style="font-style: italic">doors</span>.

<br />----------------------
<br /><br />Prefabs now total 118
<br /><br />Added 'Ancients Stuff' (lost civilization temple, excavation)
<br />Added most of the id game machinery, including Destabilizer and Hydrocon Generator <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320005927im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /><br />Added ready-made consoles with GUIs (very useful!)
<br />All prefabs should now be at Z point, Some were off center.
<br />Cleaned up some filenames, some confusing names fixed
<br />Aligned most prefabs to grid, aligned nearly all textures better.
<br /><br />NOTE: Nearly all of these prefabs are RECREATIONS made by me. The more complex ones were copied and pasted. Shouts to id software.
<br /><br />PLEASE READ THE INCLUDED README FILE!
<br /><br /><br />Prefabs worthy of particular mention:

<br /><br />I found the file here, but it was awkward. There were several layers of links to follow, generally with deceptively similar links to unwanted crud nearby. The second-to-final download link also didn't work on one try -- like the first link in your post, all I got was a page with ad cruft on it and the "back" button wouldn't work. Going through the whole thing again did work however and I now have the file; thanks.
<br /><br />What is id Software's position on reuse of map geometry from their maps, by the way? I assume that copying whole rooms and similar is a no-no, at least without giving credit where due, but copying some of the common machinery, crates, elevators, doors (including airlocks), and so forth is pretty much gonna be necessary to make maps set in the UAC facility on Mars that look "authentic". So -- is anything id reused a lot themselves fair game for drop-in reuse, but things (like the EPD machinery) that only occur once in the stock maps not? That would seem to be a fair rule, but is it one id would agree with?
<br /><br />Another scenario, and an iffier one: you copy a whole room from an id map, which had windows into inaccessible areas. Only in your map, it's the id map room that is the inaccessible area, and gameplay takes place in the area that was inaccessible in the id map, and in adjoining wholly-original areas.
<br /><br />Now this was done (a LOT) with the original half-life without any problems arising, so far as I can see. (The number of clones of the Lambda teleporter room alone is astonishing, and one ended up occurring in the official expansion pack Opposing Force.) And often the reused room was playable (it was in op4), but the rest of the map was original (you'd leave and depart by different routes). But Valve is not id, so their policies could well differ on this type of reuse.
<br /><br />This sort of thing could add a lot of flavor to a map, by adding points of contact with the original storyline (as was done in op4). Would it probably be okay if it were a) credited, b) the rest was original, and c) there may or may not be changes (such as it's later in the invasion than when the original game's player character saw the area, and growths and pentagrams have appeared in the area that weren't there before (aren't in the id map), or vice versa)... Examples would include things like, say, Betruger's office and immediate environs prior to time when the growths appeared that are in the admin map; or the entry lounge seen from one of the inaccessible (in the original game) side areas, looking the same but unreachable.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p150865" date="Posted: Mon Jul 24, 2006 5:16 am "><author>Twisted0n3</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Eh -- I don't see some basic prefabs like single chairs, tables, <span style="font-style: italic">doors</span>.

<br />there are some good ones mixed in and I will redo this pack later with some quality stuff and screens

<br /><br />I found the file here, but it was awkward. There were several layers of links to follow, generally with deceptively similar links to unwanted crud nearby. The second-to-final download link also didn't work on one try -- like the first link in your post, all I got was a page with ad cruft on it and the "back" button wouldn't work. Going through the whole thing again did work however and I now have the file; thanks.
<br /><br />What is id Software's position on reuse of map geometry from their maps, by the way? I assume that copying whole rooms and similar is a no-no, at least without giving credit where due, but copying some of the common machinery, crates, elevators, doors (including airlocks), and so forth is pretty much gonna be necessary to make maps set in the UAC facility on Mars that look "authentic". So -- is anything id reused a lot themselves fair game for drop-in reuse, but things (like the EPD machinery) that only occur once in the stock maps not? That would seem to be a fair rule, but is it one id would agree with?
<br /><br />Another scenario, and an iffier one: you copy a whole room from an id map, which had windows into inaccessible areas. Only in your map, it's the id map room that is the inaccessible area, and gameplay takes place in the area that was inaccessible in the id map, and in adjoining wholly-original areas.
<br /><br />Now this was done (a LOT) with the original half-life without any problems arising, so far as I can see. (The number of clones of the Lambda teleporter room alone is astonishing, and one ended up occurring in the official expansion pack Opposing Force.) And often the reused room was playable (it was in op4), but the rest of the map was original (you'd leave and depart by different routes). But Valve is not id, so their policies could well differ on this type of reuse.
<br /><br />This sort of thing could add a lot of flavor to a map, by adding points of contact with the original storyline (as was done in op4). Would it probably be okay if it were a) credited, b) the rest was original, and c) there may or may not be changes (such as it's later in the invasion than when the original game's player character saw the area, and growths and pentagrams have appeared in the area that weren't there before (aren't in the id map), or vice versa)... Examples would include things like, say, Betruger's office and immediate environs prior to time when the growths appeared that are in the admin map; or the entry lounge seen from one of the inaccessible (in the original game) side areas, looking the same but unreachable.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p150865" date="Posted: Mon Jul 24, 2006 5:16 am "><author>Twisted0n3</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Eh -- I don't see some basic prefabs like single chairs, tables, <span style="font-style: italic">doors</span>.

<br />----------------------
<br /><br />Prefabs now total 118
<br /><br />Added 'Ancients Stuff' (lost civilization temple, excavation)
<br />Added most of the id game machinery, including Destabilizer and Hydrocon Generator <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320005927im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /><br />Added ready-made consoles with GUIs (very useful!)
<br />All prefabs should now be at Z point, Some were off center.
<br />Cleaned up some filenames, some confusing names fixed
<br />Aligned most prefabs to grid, aligned nearly all textures better.
<br /><br />NOTE: Nearly all of these prefabs are RECREATIONS made by me. The more complex ones were copied and pasted. Shouts to id software.
<br /><br />PLEASE READ THE INCLUDED README FILE!
<br /><br /><br />Prefabs worthy of particular mention:

<br />----------------------
<br /><br />Prefabs now total 118
<br /><br />Added 'Ancients Stuff' (lost civilization temple, excavation)
<br />Added most of the id game machinery, including Destabilizer and Hydrocon Generator <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224143646im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /><br />Added ready-made consoles with GUIs (very useful!)
<br />All prefabs should now be at Z point, Some were off center.
<br />Cleaned up some filenames, some confusing names fixed
<br />Aligned most prefabs to grid, aligned nearly all textures better.
<br /><br />NOTE: Nearly all of these prefabs are RECREATIONS made by me. The more complex ones were copied and pasted. Shouts to id software.
<br /><br />PLEASE READ THE INCLUDED README FILE!
<br /><br /><br />Prefabs worthy of particular mention:

<br /><br />I found the file here, but it was awkward. There were several layers of links to follow, generally with deceptively similar links to unwanted crud nearby. The second-to-final download link also didn't work on one try -- like the first link in your post, all I got was a page with ad cruft on it and the "back" button wouldn't work. Going through the whole thing again did work however and I now have the file; thanks.
<br /><br />What is id Software's position on reuse of map geometry from their maps, by the way? I assume that copying whole rooms and similar is a no-no, at least without giving credit where due, but copying some of the common machinery, crates, elevators, doors (including airlocks), and so forth is pretty much gonna be necessary to make maps set in the UAC facility on Mars that look "authentic". So -- is anything id reused a lot themselves fair game for drop-in reuse, but things (like the EPD machinery) that only occur once in the stock maps not? That would seem to be a fair rule, but is it one id would agree with?
<br /><br />Another scenario, and an iffier one: you copy a whole room from an id map, which had windows into inaccessible areas. Only in your map, it's the id map room that is the inaccessible area, and gameplay takes place in the area that was inaccessible in the id map, and in adjoining wholly-original areas.
<br /><br />Now this was done (a LOT) with the original half-life without any problems arising, so far as I can see. (The number of clones of the Lambda teleporter room alone is astonishing, and one ended up occurring in the official expansion pack Opposing Force.) And often the reused room was playable (it was in op4), but the rest of the map was original (you'd leave and depart by different routes). But Valve is not id, so their policies could well differ on this type of reuse.
<br /><br />This sort of thing could add a lot of flavor to a map, by adding points of contact with the original storyline (as was done in op4). Would it probably be okay if it were a) credited, b) the rest was original, and c) there may or may not be changes (such as it's later in the invasion than when the original game's player character saw the area, and growths and pentagrams have appeared in the area that weren't there before (aren't in the id map), or vice versa)... Examples would include things like, say, Betruger's office and immediate environs prior to time when the growths appeared that are in the admin map; or the entry lounge seen from one of the inaccessible (in the original game) side areas, looking the same but unreachable.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p150865" date="Posted: Mon Jul 24, 2006 5:16 am "><author>Twisted0n3</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Eh -- I don't see some basic prefabs like single chairs, tables, <span style="font-style: italic">doors</span>.

<br /><br />I found the file here, but it was awkward. There were several layers of links to follow, generally with deceptively similar links to unwanted crud nearby. The second-to-final download link also didn't work on one try -- like the first link in your post, all I got was a page with ad cruft on it and the "back" button wouldn't work. Going through the whole thing again did work however and I now have the file; thanks.
<br /><br />What is id Software's position on reuse of map geometry from their maps, by the way? I assume that copying whole rooms and similar is a no-no, at least without giving credit where due, but copying some of the common machinery, crates, elevators, doors (including airlocks), and so forth is pretty much gonna be necessary to make maps set in the UAC facility on Mars that look "authentic". So -- is anything id reused a lot themselves fair game for drop-in reuse, but things (like the EPD machinery) that only occur once in the stock maps not? That would seem to be a fair rule, but is it one id would agree with?
<br /><br />Another scenario, and an iffier one: you copy a whole room from an id map, which had windows into inaccessible areas. Only in your map, it's the id map room that is the inaccessible area, and gameplay takes place in the area that was inaccessible in the id map, and in adjoining wholly-original areas.
<br /><br />Now this was done (a LOT) with the original half-life without any problems arising, so far as I can see. (The number of clones of the Lambda teleporter room alone is astonishing, and one ended up occurring in the official expansion pack Opposing Force.) And often the reused room was playable (it was in op4), but the rest of the map was original (you'd leave and depart by different routes). But Valve is not id, so their policies could well differ on this type of reuse.
<br /><br />This sort of thing could add a lot of flavor to a map, by adding points of contact with the original storyline (as was done in op4). Would it probably be okay if it were a) credited, b) the rest was original, and c) there may or may not be changes (such as it's later in the invasion than when the original game's player character saw the area, and growths and pentagrams have appeared in the area that weren't there before (aren't in the id map), or vice versa)... Examples would include things like, say, Betruger's office and immediate environs prior to time when the growths appeared that are in the admin map; or the entry lounge seen from one of the inaccessible (in the original game) side areas, looking the same but unreachable.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p150865" date="Posted: Mon Jul 24, 2006 5:16 am "><author>Twisted0n3</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Eh -- I don't see some basic prefabs like single chairs, tables, <span style="font-style: italic">doors</span>.

<br />----------------------
<br /><br />Prefabs now total 118
<br /><br />Added 'Ancients Stuff' (lost civilization temple, excavation)
<br />Added most of the id game machinery, including Destabilizer and Hydrocon Generator <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224143139im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /><br />Added ready-made consoles with GUIs (very useful!)
<br />All prefabs should now be at Z point, Some were off center.
<br />Cleaned up some filenames, some confusing names fixed
<br />Aligned most prefabs to grid, aligned nearly all textures better.
<br /><br />NOTE: Nearly all of these prefabs are RECREATIONS made by me. The more complex ones were copied and pasted. Shouts to id software.
<br /><br />PLEASE READ THE INCLUDED README FILE!
<br /><br /><br />Prefabs worthy of particular mention:

<br />Ive gotten alot of feedback on the tutorials for func_conveyor and escalators func_jumpad in vanilla doom 3 so I wipped up this pack with examples of theese and some new concepts plus examples from some of my tutorials
<br />for example
<br />how to use target_setinfluence
<br />func_phantomobjects
<br />and some reference crap
<br />there are some good ones mixed in and I will redo this pack later with some quality stuff and screens
<br />again I rushed it because of all the curisoity generated by those tutorials
<br /><br />Ust this and any of my other stuff however you want
<br />for the conveyor texture to show up right you will need to copy the def text from my tutorial on func_conveyors in doom3

<br />----------------------
<br /><br />Prefabs now total 118
<br /><br />Added 'Ancients Stuff' (lost civilization temple, excavation)
<br />Added most of the id game machinery, including Destabilizer and Hydrocon Generator <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224142342im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /><br />Added ready-made consoles with GUIs (very useful!)
<br />All prefabs should now be at Z point, Some were off center.
<br />Cleaned up some filenames, some confusing names fixed
<br />Aligned most prefabs to grid, aligned nearly all textures better.
<br /><br />NOTE: Nearly all of these prefabs are RECREATIONS made by me. The more complex ones were copied and pasted. Shouts to id software.
<br /><br />PLEASE READ THE INCLUDED README FILE!
<br /><br /><br />Prefabs worthy of particular mention:
<br />*************************************
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Elevator/Moth_TwoFloorGUI_NoScripting</span> -
<br />Two Floor Elevator with GUIs and properly-working doors  - <span style="font-style: italic">requires NO SCRIPTING!</span>
<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Machines/Moth_RotatingLightMachine</span> - Floor-Standing machine with a rotating light-emitting disc.

<br />Ive gotten alot of feedback on the tutorials for func_conveyor and escalators func_jumpad in vanilla doom 3 so I wipped up this pack with examples of theese and some new concepts plus examples from some of my tutorials
<br />for example
<br />how to use target_setinfluence
<br />func_phantomobjects
<br />and some reference crap
<br />there are some good ones mixed in and I will redo this pack later with some quality stuff and screens
<br />again I rushed it because of all the curisoity generated by those tutorials
<br /><br />Ust this and any of my other stuff however you want
<br />for the conveyor texture to show up right you will need to copy the def text from my tutorial on func_conveyors in doom3

<br />Ive gotten alot of feedback on the tutorials for func_conveyor and escalators func_jumpad in vanilla doom 3 so I wipped up this pack with examples of theese and some new concepts plus examples from some of my tutorials
<br />for example
<br />how to use target_setinfluence
<br />func_phantomobjects
<br />and some reference crap
<br />there are some good ones mixed in and I will redo this pack later with some quality stuff and screens
<br />again I rushed it because of all the curisoity generated by those tutorials
<br /><br />Ust this and any of my other stuff however you want
<br />for the conveyor texture to show up right you will need to copy the def text from my tutorial on func_conveyors in doom3
<br />and create a new def of your own

i typicall name them something like&#13;

escalator_trigger_1 so they dont but not all my prefabs were done so since they initially were for my use alone and the ones I rushed out arnt named properly just so people could have examples of how to do it I plan on cleaning up my prefabs for a decent release soon&#13;

i typicall name them something like&#13;
<br/>
escalator_trigger_1 so they dont but not all my prefabs were done so since they initially were for my use alone and the ones I rushed out arnt named properly just so people could have examples of how to do it I plan on cleaning up my prefabs for a decent release soon&#13;

Sorry&#13;

I figured better something for now and a revised edition later<br/>_________________<br/>it was bad enough imps and maggots everywhere but when that Hellknight copped a feel that was to much now I really was in hell&#13;

<br /><br />I found the file here, but it was awkward. There were several layers of links to follow, generally with deceptively similar links to unwanted crud nearby. The second-to-final download link also didn't work on one try -- like the first link in your post, all I got was a page with ad cruft on it and the "back" button wouldn't work. Going through the whole thing again did work however and I now have the file; thanks.
<br /><br />What is id Software's position on reuse of map geometry from their maps, by the way? I assume that copying whole rooms and similar is a no-no, at least without giving credit where due, but copying some of the common machinery, crates, elevators, doors (including airlocks), and so forth is pretty much gonna be necessary to make maps set in the UAC facility on Mars that look "authentic". So -- is anything id reused a lot themselves fair game for drop-in reuse, but things (like the EPD machinery) that only occur once in the stock maps not? That would seem to be a fair rule, but is it one id would agree with?

Examples would include things like, say, Betruger's office and immediate environs prior to time when the growths appeared that are in the admin map; or the entry lounge seen from one of the inaccessible (in the original game) side areas, looking the same but unreachable.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p150865" date="Posted: Mon Jul 24, 2006 4:16 am "><author>Twisted0n3</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Eh -- I don't see some basic prefabs like single chairs, tables, <span style="font-style: italic">doors</span>.

<br /><br />I found the file here, but it was awkward. There were several layers of links to follow, generally with deceptively similar links to unwanted crud nearby. The second-to-final download link also didn't work on one try -- like the first link in your post, all I got was a page with ad cruft on it and the "back" button wouldn't work. Going through the whole thing again did work however and I now have the file; thanks.
<br /><br />What is id Software's position on reuse of map geometry from their maps, by the way? I assume that copying whole rooms and similar is a no-no, at least without giving credit where due, but copying some of the common machinery, crates, elevators, doors (including airlocks), and so forth is pretty much gonna be necessary to make maps set in the UAC facility on Mars that look "authentic". So -- is anything id reused a lot themselves fair game for drop-in reuse, but things (like the EPD machinery) that only occur once in the stock maps not? That would seem to be a fair rule, but is it one id would agree with?
<br /><br />Another scenario, and an iffier one: you copy a whole room from an id map, which had windows into inaccessible areas. Only in your map, it's the id map room that is the inaccessible area, and gameplay takes place in the area that was inaccessible in the id map, and in adjoining wholly-original areas.
<br /><br />Now this was done (a LOT) with the original half-life without any problems arising, so far as I can see. (The number of clones of the Lambda teleporter room alone is astonishing, and one ended up occurring in the official expansion pack Opposing Force.) And often the reused room was playable (it was in op4), but the rest of the map was original (you'd leave and depart by different routes). But Valve is not id, so their policies could well differ on this type of reuse.

<br /><br />I found the file here, but it was awkward. There were several layers of links to follow, generally with deceptively similar links to unwanted crud nearby. The second-to-final download link also didn't work on one try -- like the first link in your post, all I got was a page with ad cruft on it and the "back" button wouldn't work. Going through the whole thing again did work however and I now have the file; thanks.
<br /><br />What is id Software's position on reuse of map geometry from their maps, by the way? I assume that copying whole rooms and similar is a no-no, at least without giving credit where due, but copying some of the common machinery, crates, elevators, doors (including airlocks), and so forth is pretty much gonna be necessary to make maps set in the UAC facility on Mars that look "authentic". So -- is anything id reused a lot themselves fair game for drop-in reuse, but things (like the EPD machinery) that only occur once in the stock maps not? That would seem to be a fair rule, but is it one id would agree with?
<br /><br />Another scenario, and an iffier one: you copy a whole room from an id map, which had windows into inaccessible areas. Only in your map, it's the id map room that is the inaccessible area, and gameplay takes place in the area that was inaccessible in the id map, and in adjoining wholly-original areas.
<br /><br />Now this was done (a LOT) with the original half-life without any problems arising, so far as I can see. (The number of clones of the Lambda teleporter room alone is astonishing, and one ended up occurring in the official expansion pack Opposing Force.) And often the reused room was playable (it was in op4), but the rest of the map was original (you'd leave and depart by different routes). But Valve is not id, so their policies could well differ on this type of reuse.
<br /><br />This sort of thing could add a lot of flavor to a map, by adding points of contact with the original storyline (as was done in op4). Would it probably be okay if it were a) credited, b) the rest was original, and c) there may or may not be changes (such as it's later in the invasion than when the original game's player character saw the area, and growths and pentagrams have appeared in the area that weren't there before (aren't in the id map), or vice versa)... Examples would include things like, say, Betruger's office and immediate environs prior to time when the growths appeared that are in the admin map; or the entry lounge seen from one of the inaccessible (in the original game) side areas, looking the same but unreachable.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p150865" date="Posted: Mon Jul 24, 2006 4:16 am "><author>Twisted0n3</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Eh -- I don't see some basic prefabs like single chairs, tables, <span style="font-style: italic">doors</span>.

<br /><br />I found the file here, but it was awkward. There were several layers of links to follow, generally with deceptively similar links to unwanted crud nearby. The second-to-final download link also didn't work on one try -- like the first link in your post, all I got was a page with ad cruft on it and the "back" button wouldn't work. Going through the whole thing again did work however and I now have the file; thanks.
<br /><br />What is id Software's position on reuse of map geometry from their maps, by the way? I assume that copying whole rooms and similar is a no-no, at least without giving credit where due, but copying some of the common machinery, crates, elevators, doors (including airlocks), and so forth is pretty much gonna be necessary to make maps set in the UAC facility on Mars that look "authentic". So -- is anything id reused a lot themselves fair game for drop-in reuse, but things (like the EPD machinery) that only occur once in the stock maps not? That would seem to be a fair rule, but is it one id would agree with?
<br /><br />Another scenario, and an iffier one: you copy a whole room from an id map, which had windows into inaccessible areas. Only in your map, it's the id map room that is the inaccessible area, and gameplay takes place in the area that was inaccessible in the id map, and in adjoining wholly-original areas.
<br /><br />Now this was done (a LOT) with the original half-life without any problems arising, so far as I can see. (The number of clones of the Lambda teleporter room alone is astonishing, and one ended up occurring in the official expansion pack Opposing Force.) And often the reused room was playable (it was in op4), but the rest of the map was original (you'd leave and depart by different routes). But Valve is not id, so their policies could well differ on this type of reuse.
<br /><br />This sort of thing could add a lot of flavor to a map, by adding points of contact with the original storyline (as was done in op4). Would it probably be okay if it were a) credited, b) the rest was original, and c) there may or may not be changes (such as it's later in the invasion than when the original game's player character saw the area, and growths and pentagrams have appeared in the area that weren't there before (aren't in the id map), or vice versa)... Examples would include things like, say, Betruger's office and immediate environs prior to time when the growths appeared that are in the admin map; or the entry lounge seen from one of the inaccessible (in the original game) side areas, looking the same but unreachable.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p150865" date="Posted: Mon Jul 24, 2006 4:16 am "><author>Twisted0n3</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Eh -- I don't see some basic prefabs like single chairs, tables, <span style="font-style: italic">doors</span>.

<br/>
Sorry&#13;
<br/>
I figured better something for now and a revised edition later<br/>_________________<br/>it was bad enough imps and maggots everywhere but when that Hellknight copped a feel that was to much now I really was in hell&#13;
