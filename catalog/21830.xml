The trouble is that while the exporter works fine (We have tested it ingame, no issues), the IMPORTER seems to create nasty triangles in places they, well, shouldn't. This means that when we come to export the mesh to .md5mesh, so that the smoothing is correct, and later re-import it again, the mesh displays badly in both the editor and in-game. Having tested this in various ways, we came to the conclusion that the exporter is doing its job perfectly well, the importer however, isn't.<br /><br />The reason this is an issue, is because in order to get correct .md5mesh smoothing for our weapon models, we usually export it first to .md5mesh, then re-import it, THEN render to texture for the normals, so that we get the correct, final, ingame smoothing. However these are the results we end up with for a few select models:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081120234253/http://img377.imageshack.us/img377/6654/scope2hm6.jpg">http://img377.imageshack.us/img377/6654/scope2hm6.jpg</a><!-- m --><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081120234253/http://img377.imageshack.us/img377/324/scope1kp7.jpg">http://img377.imageshack.us/img377/324/scope1kp7.jpg</a><!-- m --><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081120234253/http://img512.imageshack.us/img512/3374/normalmapqa1.jpg">http://img512.imageshack.us/img512/3374 ... mapqa1.jpg</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Now the problem itself is very random.
