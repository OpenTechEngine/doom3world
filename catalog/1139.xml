The models shown are ofcourse property of id software, and if you think they look ugly then itÃÂ´s my fault, sorry for coding a crappy viewer.&#13;
<br/>
If you think they look cool then itÃÂ´s due to the talent of the guys at id software.&#13;
<br/><br/>
My viewer currently has code paths for graphic boards with 4 texture units and for those with 2. With 4 texture units, it uses 2 passes for each lightsource, one for diffuse-bump-lit decal + ambient and one for specular, in both passes all 4 units are used. IÃÂ´ll add another codepath for boards with 8 texture units to do it all in one pass.&#13;
<br/>
The OpenGL-extensions that my viewer uses are all GL_ARB and GL_EXT extensions, no hardware-specific NV or ATI extensions are used! I wanted to avoid developing different code paths for different hardware, and by the way I only have a GF4200, so testing any ATI-specific code would be tedious.&#13;

Pinky is lit by two lightsources, one slightly above the camera, one far to the left:&#13;

Sorry to dissappoint you, but the viewerÃÂ´s UI is a "script" that is loaded during initialization, in which the user specifies which models with which animations at what positions and angles it should display (lightsources are hardcoded/mousecontrolled right now, but reading them from that setup script would be easy). And then there are a whole bunch of keys to move the camera, to move the lightsource, and to do affect certain parameters. IÃÂ´ll maybe do a real UI. IÃÂ´m really not sure in what direction this could go after all, but if thereÃÂ´s a need for a program to display md5meshes and anims for people who design their models, this program could be useful after some usability additions have been made, yep.&#13;

Sure it can, IÃÂ´m running it in alot of modes for debugging the setup of the rendering passes and the texture stages. But I havenÃÂ´t implemented those things as being interactive yet. But thatÃÂ´s a piece of cake actually.&#13;
<br/><br/>
BTW, you can check out D3ÃÂ´s specular pass with r_diffuse "0" if i remember correctly.&#13;

Applying a md5anim to a model is fully implemented, I thought it shows from the screenshots... <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0"/><br/>
Adding control of the animation to the program would be easy, because the rendering method (yes, itÃÂ´s object oriented code) only takes the time as an input. Currently the main program passes the program time (multiplied by a slowdown/speedup factor) to the animation code, but with some interaction (keys or gui-buttons in the future) anything can be done, for example jumping through the keyframes or freezing or playing backwards or pingpong or whatever.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Thanks to everyone for showing interest and for giving me input, just keep your comments coming.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0"/></span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

Just wanted to be sure that it can play a full animation cycle.&#13;

Sounds good.&#13;
<br/>
If there's a feature wishlist, I'd like to add:&#13;
<br/>
- looping an animation&#13;
<br/>
- using a timeline slider to go through it back and forth frame by frame&#13;
<br/>
- some sort of listing what animations are available for this particular model, so I don't have to load them all manually&#13;

Well, I would be happy to check out the single pass code for you if your kind enough to pass it along since I have this wonderful ATi card with 8 texture pipelines.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0"/><br/>_________________<br/><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://billhunter.net/" target="_blank" class="postlink"><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-style: italic">BBA</span></span></a></span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

thanks for the offer!&#13;
<br/>
I havenÃÂ´t implemented it yet, though, and IÃÂ´ll first get it working nicely with "normal" codepaths, and then IÃÂ´ll release it (maybe this week!) and then IÃÂ´ll add the 8-textureunits path. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0"/><br/>
I wanted to have it done earlier, but some lazyness kicked in lately, and the kinda frustrating problem with the mirrored textures (solved now) has cost me some nerves...</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>
