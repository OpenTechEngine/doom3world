<br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203022831im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" /> As a note I don't use any snippets of the Doom3 SDK or something else. This is complete new code written from scratch for the old Q3A engine architecture.
<br /><br />I finally implemented some basic client game code for skeletal animation. The new code is quite experimental but the following video shows a Quake4 Plugable Player Model (PPM) called IDGirl by Vahl running in a converted custom Doom3 multiplayer map Thunderstruck. The animation system uses a single .md5mesh for the body and mixes all legs and torso animations together. Well the death animations are missing yet.
<br />Another special thing is that I put a projective light into the map that projects the sky clouds onto everything in the map: world, players, items et cetera.
<br /><br /><br />OK here is a XviD 27.8 MB demonstrating this stuff with a simple bot match:

<br /><br /><br /><br />Another interesting feature is omni-directional variance shadow mapping that allows alpha tested shadows. Most guys of you know that the Doom3 tech, F.E.A.R and other engines  using stencil shadow volumes have to fake that with a good light attenuation.
<br />I hope that we will see that feature in id's next engine. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203022831im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203022831im_/http://xreal.sourceforge.net/screenshots/test-shadowmapping0015.jpg" alt="Image" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p167592" date="Posted: Tue Jan 16, 2007 6:22 pm "><author>Koroshiya Ichi</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">nice!!

<br /><br />Looks marvelous!
<br /><br />I also was a bit disappointed by the lack of alpha tested shadows, but eventually got over it quickly.

Maybe it's not so common yet.
<br />Anway XreaL is not a Q3A mod for Doom3. It is a heavily modified Q3A Total Conversion based off the GPL release from 2005 and able to run Doom3, Quake4 or Prey media assets. 
<br />Well it's not a finished TC yet because we have not enough modellers and texture artists.
<br />I rewrote the renderer to support Doom3 material files and Doom3 maps can be compiled to the Q3A BSP format using a customized XMap compiler. It supports Doom3 style lighting and shadowing but I wrote all this stuff from scratch. It doesn't reach the same speed as Doom3 for several reasons. Doom3 has more optimizations and XreaL uses GLSL shaders for a high quality mode. I think you could get similar results with the 3Mood interaction generator.
<br /><br />For a technical list of what this engine is different to vanilla Q3A look here:

<br /><br />The goal is to create a complete new multiplayer game with similar gameplay to classic Q3A but graphics on a level of Doom3 and other current tech games. It would be nice if we could get more artists to work on this to make it a game like Tremulous, Warsow or Nexuiz.
<br /><br />The main difference is that all media should be made of normal-mapped stuff to take advantage of the per-pixel power XreaL features.
<br /><br />It doesn't make much sense to put last generation stuff like OpenArena into XreaL/base/ and run it with per pixel lighting. It might look even worse without proper normal maps.
<br /><br />XreaL is more than just an improved Q3A engine. I modified the GtkRadiant, Q3Map1, and almost everything to have a certain degree of compatibility with Doom3 community assets.
<br />It uses the Doom3 .map format and follows the convention that every level entity should have a name. These are some radical changes compared to the old Q3A tech which affect almost everything ... even the bot library.
<br /><br />Well most of these things are answered in the FAQ section:

It's simply to slow even in Quake4.<br />Most Quakers want a 125 fps game and we cannot achieve that with pure realtime lighting and up to 20 visible characters.<br />Our goal is a renderer like in Unreal Tournament 3 where 97% of the lights are used for lightmap baking.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p203166" date="Posted: Tue Aug 05, 2008 6:01 pm "><author>Empire Games</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks for the info about portals with xreal......i did not know that.<br />also i don't use the pre alpha downloads,every morning i update from svn and recompile all projects.<br />I saw that you have fixed some stuff on the map in the svn log (thanks <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203022419im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> ) i will update check it out.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p203186" date="Posted: Wed Aug 06, 2008 2:58 am "><author>Empire Games</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">OK...............................I turned all vis_portal brushes to hint brushes and it completely fixed my vis problem.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p203196" date="Posted: Wed Aug 06, 2008 9:15 am "><author>Empire Games</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Also i had to load it into a stock q4 editor and do a brush cleanup to fix the disappearing textures.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p167590" date="Posted: Tue Jan 16, 2007 6:05 pm "><author>Tr3B</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Ok I think I should post this stuff here because I learned really much about the Doom3 tech by reading these forums.
<br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203021944im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" /> As a note I don't use any snippets of the Doom3 SDK or something else. This is complete new code written from scratch for the old Q3A engine architecture.
<br /><br />I finally implemented some basic client game code for skeletal animation. The new code is quite experimental but the following video shows a Quake4 Plugable Player Model (PPM) called IDGirl by Vahl running in a converted custom Doom3 multiplayer map Thunderstruck. The animation system uses a single .md5mesh for the body and mixes all legs and torso animations together. Well the death animations are missing yet.
<br />Another special thing is that I put a projective light into the map that projects the sky clouds onto everything in the map: world, players, items et cetera.
<br /><br /><br />OK here is a XviD 27.8 MB demonstrating this stuff with a simple bot match:

<br /><br /><br /><br />Another interesting feature is omni-directional variance shadow mapping that allows alpha tested shadows. Most guys of you know that the Doom3 tech, F.E.A.R and other engines  using stencil shadow volumes have to fake that with a good light attenuation.

Maybe it's not so common yet.
<br />Anway XreaL is not a Q3A mod for Doom3. It is a heavily modified Q3A Total Conversion based off the GPL release from 2005 and able to run Doom3, Quake4 or Prey media assets. 
<br />Well it's not a finished TC yet because we have not enough modellers and texture artists.
<br />I rewrote the renderer to support Doom3 material files and Doom3 maps can be compiled to the Q3A BSP format using a customized XMap compiler. It supports Doom3 style lighting and shadowing but I wrote all this stuff from scratch. It doesn't reach the same speed as Doom3 for several reasons. Doom3 has more optimizations and XreaL uses GLSL shaders for a high quality mode. I think you could get similar results with the 3Mood interaction generator.

<br /><br />The goal is to create a complete new multiplayer game with similar gameplay to classic Q3A but graphics on a level of Doom3 and other current tech games. It would be nice if we could get more artists to work on this to make it a game like Tremulous, Warsow or Nexuiz.
<br /><br />The main difference is that all media should be made of normal-mapped stuff to take advantage of the per-pixel power XreaL features.
<br /><br />It doesn't make much sense to put last generation stuff like OpenArena into XreaL/base/ and run it with per pixel lighting. It might look even worse without proper normal maps.
<br /><br />XreaL is more than just an improved Q3A engine. I modified the GtkRadiant, Q3Map1, and almost everything to have a certain degree of compatibility with Doom3 community assets.
<br />It uses the Doom3 .map format and follows the convention that every level entity should have a name. These are some radical changes compared to the old Q3A tech which affect almost everything ... even the bot library.

Perhaps I'm misinterpreting your particular usage.</div><br /><br />Well I merge the geometry of all light interactions for each light together to big VBOs. This saves a lot of tiny individual light surface drawings but suffers that you can't group light interactions in a view-dependend way like PSVSM requires it for every frame. <br />That is necessary or I would have to render up to 10 000 light interactions, because of all those tiny BSP surfaces. <br />I don't even render all six view pyramids for every point light. I have another little trick: I mark surface interactions in what pyramids of the point light they rely and then I only render relevant surfaces for each of those 6 views. The the other cubesides will be just cleared to the default value so sometimes it is also possible to update only 2-3 pyramids of a point light.<br />I think you can't handle that much better with DX9 target hardware. Ah well I investigated really a lot of time to think about optimizations like that. My last optimization was to remove duplicated vertices from all kinds of used VBOs. Especially shadow geometry can be simplified because you only need to consider the vertex position and can ignore vertex uv coords when your surface doesn't require an alpha test.<br /><br />However in the next phase I'm going to try to generate HDR lightmaps with the engine's renderer at map load. Realtime lighting is really nice but I have to admit that I really like the high quality lightmapping of Unreal Tournament 3.<br />I would like to do the same with Doom 3's light attenuation model or better the one I have developed with XreaL, which is similar. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203055626im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br />XreaL is even able to use .roq videos for lighting.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p196305" date="Posted: Mon Mar 10, 2008 8:33 pm "><author>voldemort</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><span style="color: #4040FF">XreaL is even able to use .roq videos for lighting.</span><br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203055626im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203055626im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203055626im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br />I would put more smiles but I thought that might be overkill</div>]]></body></post><post id="p196649" date="Posted: Tue Mar 18, 2008 8:32 pm "><author>Tr3B</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I was finally able to port Q3Map2 over to the XreaL project as XMap2.<br /><br />Now it is possible to use all the lightmapping goodies of Q3Map2 with Doom 3 style materials to produce high quality directional lightmaps.<br /><br />I compiled gwdm2 with deluxe light mapping:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203055626/http://xreal.varcache.org/screenshots/shot0071.jpg">http://xreal.varcache.org/screenshots/shot0071.jpg</a><!-- m --><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203055626/http://xreal.varcache.org/screenshots/shot0072.jpg">http://xreal.varcache.org/screenshots/shot0072.jpg</a><!-- m --><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203055626/http://xreal.varcache.org/screenshots/shot0073.jpg">http://xreal.varcache.org/screenshots/shot0073.jpg</a><!-- m --><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203055626/http://xreal.varcache.org/screenshots/shot0074.jpg">http://xreal.varcache.org/screenshots/shot0074.jpg</a><!-- m --><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203055626/http://xreal.varcache.org/screenshots/shot0075.jpg">http://xreal.varcache.org/screenshots/shot0075.jpg</a><!-- m --><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203055626/http://xreal.varcache.org/screenshots/shot0076.jpg">http://xreal.varcache.org/screenshots/shot0076.jpg</a><!-- m --><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203055626/http://xreal.varcache.org/screenshots/shot0077.jpg">http://xreal.varcache.org/screenshots/shot0077.jpg</a><!-- m --></div>]]></body></post><post id="p196650" date="Posted: Tue Mar 18, 2008 8:51 pm "><author>6th Venom</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">only "waw"!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203055626im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p197657" date="Posted: Sun Apr 13, 2008 5:06 am "><author>MKULTRA</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I'll be happy if XreaL really can compile D3 maps.

But at the same time you don't want to compile it your self(getting your hands dirty). Even though by doing so &amp; releasing the builds you can make it so much easier for the other developers. And release some of the strain on Tr3B to try and get all this done.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">for example if I could find out what changes there are from the stock doom 3 material files --I would be more then happy to contribute documentation on the mtr file process --but withought knowing those changes ????</div><br /><br />Again this comes back to getting your hands dirty. Are you willing to find out the limitations of xreals mtr yourself &amp; document it for everyone else to use?

That is what I intended to get with the current pre-alpha release.<br />GtkRadiant doesn't work due to a last minute bug it seems. I haven't figured it yet.<br /><br />Concerning the documentation: I know there is some lack of documentation and that sort of Q3A/Doom3 hybrid mapping<br />approach might be strange as well. However I had not enough time to write all required information in the wiki, because<br />other things of the project had a higher priority so far.<br /><br />I will release new Win32 binaries soon, which should contain a working version of the XreaL radiant.<br />Until then you can try the binaries of an older version: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203022621/http://xreal.varcache.org/XreaL_20080130-win32-vc8-binaries.zip">http://xreal.varcache.org/XreaL_2008013 ... naries.zip</a><!-- m --><br />But only use the GtkRadiant binaries in that zip file.<br />Another thing is that you need to install the needed Gtk runtime if you haven't so far: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203022621/http://xreal.varcache.org/gtk-2.10.11-win32-1.exe">http://xreal.varcache.org/gtk-2.10.11-win32-1.exe</a><!-- m --><br />Otherwise it's likely to not work at all.<br /><br />I will do more frequently pre-alpha releases in the next time. One new pre-alpha for every month should be possible.<br /><br />Concerning Parallel-Split Variance Shadow Maps: I know how it works but I handle light interactions entirely different using static VBOs that are created at load time.<br />I don't use any Light Space Perspective approaches like that. 95% of all Doom3 lights are omni-directional lights where PSVSM doesn't work so well.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p196277" date="Posted: Mon Mar 10, 2008 9:49 am "><author>Tr3B</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">OK I uploaded new recompiled binaries and one of our mappers reported that those binaries work:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203022621/http://xreal.varcache.org/XreaL_20080310-win32-vc8-binaries.zip">http://xreal.varcache.org/XreaL_2008031 ... naries.zip</a><!-- m --></div>]]></body></post><post id="p196278" date="Posted: Mon Mar 10, 2008 10:09 am "><author>Tr3B</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">New Horizon wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Has anyone been able to get the xreal version of GTK Radiant to work?

XreaL's version has some necessary changes and fixes for the this kind of hybrid mapping and is based on the GtkRadiant 1.5 branch.<br />Other people are likely to point out to other Version but that won't work. I also thought about using the Dark Radiant for XreaL with some necessary changes but it has too many changes that focus on the Darkmod's development. You removed almost everything Q3A related.
