Heck, they could of gotten a dev from Ubisoft who use a LOT of UT tech.  Could also be a PS3/360 game.  That's starting to be the new HD-console engine "whore."  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />but IF people want to start making conspiracy's....  at Q-con last year, when asked about id making products for Nintendo, JC said that they wouldn't directly deal with Nintendo, but use a publisher, <span style="font-weight: bold">like EA</span>.&#13;<br /><br />If there IS a little "friction" between Activision &amp; id that caused this, that could very well be the first sign (I, personally, thought it was wierd JC didn't mention Activision).&#13;<br /><br />Also, id could of very well said they aren't doing ANY liscencing with their new engine just yet.  Look at D3/Q4/Prey/QW.  Every new engine from D3 people said "Wow, D3 sucks compared to this variant!".  Perhaps they don't want that.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p171438" date="Posted: Sat Feb 24, 2007 5:48 pm "><author>Mordenkainen</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">The Happy Friar wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">but IF people want to start making conspiracy's....  at Q-con last year, when asked about id making products for Nintendo, JC said that they wouldn't directly deal with Nintendo, but use a publisher, <span style="font-weight: bold">like EA</span>.<br /><br />If there IS a little "friction" between Activision &amp; id that caused this, that could very well be the first sign (I, personally, thought it was wierd JC didn't mention Activision).</div>&#13;<br /><br />EA already publishes id's Orcs &amp; Elves so it's not that unlikely that they'd use EA to port to the "third, less powerful next-gen console".</div>]]></body></post><post id="p171439" date="Posted: Sat Feb 24, 2007 6:08 pm "><author>The Happy Friar</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Orcs &amp; Elves isn't a direct, id game though, it's done by JC's wife's company, isn't it?  &#13;<br /><br />Still why NOT use activision?  They deal with nintendo all the time.  The biggest EA titles for Nintendo are the Sports games (let's not forget that Raven does console work for EA too.. the latest is the Marvel game for Wii, PS3 &amp; 360).</div>]]></body></post><post id="p171496" date="Posted: Sun Feb 25, 2007 4:44 am "><author>Gabrobot</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">The Happy Friar wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Orcs &amp; Elves isn't a direct, id game though, it's done by JC's wife's company, isn't it?</div>&#13;<br /><br />It's still an id game like Quake 4 and Quake Wars though.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p172342" date="Posted: Wed Mar 07, 2007 11:28 am "><author>ergonaut</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">also it might be for a type of game that the doom technology doesnt really suit. &lt;this is most likely&#13;<br /><br />I'd guess the terrain stuff in Unreal.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p172370" date="Posted: Wed Mar 07, 2007 5:42 pm "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">ergonaut wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">also it might be for a type of game that the doom technology doesnt really suit. &lt;this is most likely<br /><br />I'd guess the terrain stuff in Unreal.</div>&#13;<br /><br />I guarantee you it's much less about the gaming engine and more about the integrated development environment.</div>]]></body></post></posts></thread></xml>
