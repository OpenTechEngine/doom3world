Also after looking at the DMMM forums, there seem to be a large number of still unresolved problems some 2 months after release.
<br /><br />The demo is fun, but I think I'll give the game a miss - or at least wait a while until the nasty bugs are sorted out. The demo by the way weighs in at about 2.8GB (via steam)!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p166325" date="Posted: Wed Jan 03, 2007 7:29 am "><author>radix2</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Just wondering if anyone has played this (apparantly based on Valve's Source engine)?

It´s like a well balanced cross between RPG and FPS, and it has some really fun mellee combat (unlike most FPSs), with plenty of opportunities to kick your opponents into a chasm, down some stairs or into spikes. <br /><br />The atmosphere is not as creepy and dark as in Hexen, but it has some really nice gloomy catacombs and ancient underground temple settings. Leveldesign is nice and varied with some exploration opportunities (but relatively linear). It adds a lot that you can approach combat situations differently, by stealthy sneaking, or using traps and other opportunities in the environment to get rid of your opponents.<br /><br />The overall atmosphere is your typical (a bit generic IMO) medieval inspired fantasy stuff. Your opponents include evil cultists, orks, goblins, spiders, zombies and so on, with some cool challenging fights against big hulking cyclopes.<br /><br />The story is okay, nothing too special.<br /><br />If your favourite genre is FPS, but you also play RPGs from time to time, I really can recommend Dark Messiah.<br /><br />edit: oh, I thaugt radix posted Jan 2009... damn spam bots.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p209435" date="Posted: Tue Jan 06, 2009 10:50 am "><author>TelMarine</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I havnet completed this yet, I have played a few hours of it, but I found the melee combat ultimately to become boring.

There are waaaaay too many conveniently placed spiked grates (or whatever you wanna call them) randomly placed near soldiers, it is just a stupid gimmick to get you to kick them into the spikes, which is all you have to do most of the time.
