Very stressful work given the limited time.<br />Overall I feel like this is the best map I created from gameplay and visual point of view. I included lots of textures inside of the pak file for community use. Read the readme for more info.<br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081120191133im_/http://www.methodonline.com/temp/moss1_d3w.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081120191133im_/http://www.methodonline.com/temp/moss2_d3w.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081120191133im_/http://www.methodonline.com/temp/moss3_d3w.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081120191133im_/http://www.methodonline.com/temp/moss4_d3w.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Download the map <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081120191133/http://www.methodonline.com/release/yan_test.zip" class="postlink">HERE</a>.<br /><br />Feedback is welcome,<br /><br />-Method</div>]]></body></post><post id="p193645" date="Posted: Wed Jan 09, 2008 8:06 am "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Looks beautiful!

It was simply a personal project.<br /><br />Heh, well as far as I know it's a regular industry procedure. You apply for the job opening, then get a phone interview, then a design test, then on site intereview and hopefully a job after. <br /><br />If you're looking for a job, it's the perfect time. I never seen so many good companies looking for people at the same time before.

That is a lot of openings! I really want to apply and show some screenshots, but none of my mapwork are actual complete, playable levels. I'm working on an awesome map right now, and I don't want to apply anywhere until I have a level in my portfolio people can actually play. Screenshots, I feel, are not enough.<br /><br />How does the design test work? Do you simply make a highly detailed map with whatever textures? Does it have to be fully playable? How much time do you get? Does your current job get in the way?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p193742" date="Posted: Fri Jan 11, 2008 6:23 pm "><author>Method</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold">pbmax</span>: It all depends on what position you apply. So if you applied for a level design position you must fullfill the requirements in the job opening. Therefore I was expected to know gameplay mechanics, texturing, lighting, optimization, etc. I got to speak with Marty Stratton (Executive Producer), a very friendly guy. He's the same guy that organizes QuakeCon for us. Then later I had to do 1 on 1 chat with some of the leads.  The offices are nice and I didn't get to see Carmack.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">evilartist</span>: Design tests have parameters, for example a futuristic combat arena. As far as I know most companies give only a week (plus a weekend). You don't have to fully finish the level, but must show that you understand gameplay. Having the time to put on visuals is definitely a plus. If it's a job for SP game then you are expected to make a fun SP, if it's a MP game then you're expected to make a fun MP map. Say if you're an environment artist you might get a concept art and expected to model and texture the scene. Again it depends on the company and position you apply.<br /><br />-Method</div>]]></body></post><post id="p193746" date="Posted: Fri Jan 11, 2008 7:25 pm "><author>CrimsonHead</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I just got done trying it out, it's simply beautiful, one of the best looking Q4 maps I've seen.

You apply for the job opening, then get a phone interview, then a design test, then on site intereview and hopefully a job after. <br /><br />If you're looking for a job, it's the perfect time.

Screenshots, I feel, are not enough.<br /><br />How does the design test work? Do you simply make a highly detailed map with whatever textures? Does it have to be fully playable?

Does your current job get in the way?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p193742" date="Posted: Fri Jan 11, 2008 6:23 pm "><author>Method</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold">pbmax</span>: It all depends on what position you apply. So if you applied for a level design position you must fullfill the requirements in the job opening. Therefore I was expected to know gameplay mechanics, texturing, lighting, optimization, etc. I got to speak with Marty Stratton (Executive Producer), a very friendly guy. He's the same guy that organizes QuakeCon for us. Then later I had to do 1 on 1 chat with some of the leads.  The offices are nice and I didn't get to see Carmack.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">evilartist</span>: Design tests have parameters, for example a futuristic combat arena. As far as I know most companies give only a week (plus a weekend). You don't have to fully finish the level, but must show that you understand gameplay. Having the time to put on visuals is definitely a plus. If it's a job for SP game then you are expected to make a fun SP, if it's a MP game then you're expected to make a fun MP map. Say if you're an environment artist you might get a concept art and expected to model and texture the scene. Again it depends on the company and position you apply.<br /><br />-Method</div>]]></body></post><post id="p193746" date="Posted: Fri Jan 11, 2008 7:25 pm "><author>CrimsonHead</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I just got done trying it out, it's simply beautiful, one of the best looking Q4 maps I've seen.

Evilartist is right, being able to speed the pipe line and let artist work on bigger things saves time and money.

It was simply a personal project.<br /><br />Heh, well as far as I know it's a regular industry procedure. You apply for the job opening, then get a phone interview, then a design test, then on site intereview and hopefully a job after. <br /><br />If you're looking for a job, it's the perfect time. I never seen so many good companies looking for people at the same time before.

That is a lot of openings! I really want to apply and show some screenshots, but none of my mapwork are actual complete, playable levels. I'm working on an awesome map right now, and I don't want to apply anywhere until I have a level in my portfolio people can actually play. Screenshots, I feel, are not enough.<br /><br />How does the design test work? Do you simply make a highly detailed map with whatever textures? Does it have to be fully playable? How much time do you get? Does your current job get in the way?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p193742" date="Posted: Fri Jan 11, 2008 6:23 pm "><author>Method</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold">pbmax</span>: It all depends on what position you apply. So if you applied for a level design position you must fullfill the requirements in the job opening. Therefore I was expected to know gameplay mechanics, texturing, lighting, optimization, etc. I got to speak with Marty Stratton (Executive Producer), a very friendly guy. He's the same guy that organizes QuakeCon for us. Then later I had to do 1 on 1 chat with some of the leads.  The offices are nice and I didn't get to see Carmack.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">evilartist</span>: Design tests have parameters, for example a futuristic combat arena. As far as I know most companies give only a week (plus a weekend). You don't have to fully finish the level, but must show that you understand gameplay. Having the time to put on visuals is definitely a plus. If it's a job for SP game then you are expected to make a fun SP, if it's a MP game then you're expected to make a fun MP map. Say if you're an environment artist you might get a concept art and expected to model and texture the scene. Again it depends on the company and position you apply.<br /><br />-Method</div>]]></body></post><post id="p193746" date="Posted: Fri Jan 11, 2008 7:25 pm "><author>CrimsonHead</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I just got done trying it out, it's simply beautiful, one of the best looking Q4 maps I've seen.

Aside from mapping, I do my own textures and models now. I hope that will be a plus to many developers.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p193755" date="Posted: Fri Jan 11, 2008 9:54 pm "><author>pbmax</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">let us know if you get the job, please.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p193764" date="Posted: Sat Jan 12, 2008 4:51 am "><author>Method</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold">blushing_bride</span>: Not odd at all. Evilartist is right, being able to speed the pipe line and let artist work on bigger things saves time and money. Even if artists are responsible for look of the levels in the end, it's always a big plus to show that you can fill other shoes, which makes your value higher to the company.<br /><br />-Method</div>]]></body></post><post id="p193766" date="Posted: Sat Jan 12, 2008 10:56 am "><author>Zombie13</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Awesome looking, my only gripe (and it's very picky - quality is uber high , so you have to be) is that the lighting is a little samey everywhere, but in one way it's not a bad thing, because the atmosphere and geometry are very well done along with the textures.<br /><br />Good luck with id, they are a great bunch of guys and hugely talented <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081120190109im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_surprised.gif" alt=":o" title="Surprised" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p193804" date="Posted: Sun Jan 13, 2008 6:31 am "><author>Horror</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Beautiful work!

I learned so much in short time here at id, that I think most of my stuff is shit except this map, which is an ok for the time I was given. I agree with Killmachine all of my stuff was very simple.<br /><br />The inspiration is lack of time. When you have only 10 days to make a level and especially for your number one choice company you tend to push. I decided to include things I liked in other shooters, such as vegetation in Unreal maps and misaligned planks of wood from HL. Then I applied it to Quake Universe and got the map's look.<br /><br />-Method</div>]]></body></post><post id="p204555" date="Posted: Fri Sep 05, 2008 2:10 am "><author>Douglas Quaid</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Well I have to say this is a very nice looking map.
