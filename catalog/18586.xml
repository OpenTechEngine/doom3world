Best PC game since Half Life?</title><posts><post id="p169202" date="Posted: Sat Feb 03, 2007 6:30 am "><author>The Happy Friar</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I just completed it &amp; it's absolutely fabulous.  I loved every bit of it &amp; played it every night until I beat it.  Not only MUCH better then Doom 3 &amp; Quake 4, but it REALLY showed what the D3 engine can do.  The gravity work was way above what I expected, so was the portal usage.  Story was one of the most engrossing ones ever in a video game.   I also love all the extra tid-bits you could pay attention to if you wanted (like art bell) but the story still progressed even if you didn't want to (which is unlike HL2 imho, which really required you to pay attentions to most details to understand why things are happening).  
<br /><br />I've noticed a few things that were never explained inthe game though &amp; I'm hoping some people here know/have theories:
<br /><br />1) women aren't processed?  Only men are killed at the start (like grandfather).
<br /><br />2) children aren't processed either?
<br /><br />3) what's up with the white wraiths?  They possessed the kids (apparently only girls) &amp; aren't limited to the sphere (as in an art bell call).  Strangely, the art book that came with the tin box version of prey all shows boy-possessed kids, but only possessed girls made it in the game?
<br /><br />4) is the whole point of the sphere to harvest planets to keep on living?  In the game there's no other point (told in the plot).
<br /><br />5) the doom easter egg was too funny.  Not only was it a punch at doom, it was near identical to the DN3D one!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p169213" date="Posted: Sat Feb 03, 2007 7:21 am "><author>Gabrobot</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">The Happy Friar wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">1) women aren't processed?

<br /><br />Must've just been a coincidence, because I've seen women get processed.

The story was ehm ok, but Tomy's voice was bad. Gameplay was crappy, some maps were so bad that I was surprised that they could release them, they looked like they were made by 5 year old. Probably they thought that the game is too short so they slapped in few from recycle bin. Weapon sounds were bad and models looked very reminiscent to Quake4 ones. Puzzles were boring though modern. Games performance was much better than D3 for me. I could ran it on the highest detail without any slowdown and the textures looked sharp. Still the game looked like D3.

<br /><br />I especially love what he says &amp; the timing.  Infact, right before he mentions he's going to puke from all the initial grav changes, that's exactly what I thought.  I'd imagine they had people play through &amp; then say their reactions.  
<br /><br />I also like near the end when you start to enjoy blasting baddies.  It's about time a character you play enjoys blowing things up as much as you do.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320011546im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />I thought the weapon sounds were good.  
<br /><br />I also loved the level design.  Unlike every other game out there (ever), the levels are the puzzles.  There's no "follow the walkway" for most of the game, it's nearly all "ok, i need to get over there...  how can i?"</div>]]></body></post><post id="p169268" date="Posted: Sat Feb 03, 2007 7:24 pm "><author>Regulator</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Good voice acting is realy hard to find in games. I'd say that Sam Fisher [Micheal Ironside] voice was pretty good, not perfect, but above the average. Though I think sometimes it was 'drowned'. Alyx from Hl2 was ok, that black dudes voice from Avp2 [and FEAR?] was really good. Not too overacted, but still charismatic and not the one you'd forget. Prey's Tommys voice was way too overacted, annoying and it was mentioned on bunch of gaming boards I've visited too so thats not just my opinion. Imho the only cool thing in Prey was menu music, it was really good, epic, but melodic'n stuff.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p169271" date="Posted: Sat Feb 03, 2007 7:33 pm "><author>Phobos</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I've always wanted to grab a copy of the game, I just haven't picked one up yet :'(</div>]]></body></post><post id="p169288" date="Posted: Sat Feb 03, 2007 9:29 pm "><author>Arklon</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">The Happy Friar wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I especially love what he says &amp; the timing.

lot about XP the registry bloat and after awhile it tends to lag and slow down not to mention the damage crashes dose to it(I have had DX be damaged at least 2 times in the past year and guess what you can not simply reinstall it to fix it you have to reinstall the OS....),from everythign I have read its better to make a 100% backup of a fresh install or to reinstall,I don't have the space  for a backup so I do something called mantanace to it by reinstalling it because its more a best of burden than a OS.<br /><br />Oh and yes I run defrag and scandisk every 2 weeks it dose not seem to help once the registry gets past a certain point,I also run my computer 24/7 because it is better not to restart it a lot int eh same day.<br /><br />You seem to think since I dare install it more than once I am breaking the law,hell MS thinks that and thus why I try very hard to fight against corporate nonsense like this.<br /><br />Tell me what is your personal limit on online activation you have to register the game and give your name and number and DOB half the time they hold in it sa list to sell off to the highest bidder or use it for inhouse statistical data,ect,ect,ect<br /><br />There is always a certain amount of worry about giving away my name and address and such     I try and limit as much as possible and find the invasive tactics of most online activation systems disturbing I would like a balance between them, Dark messiah used a inresting  setup if they could use steam to enable online play and then have it where you can avoid that by just install SP I would like it a lot more but they do not give you that choice thats why for retail games I simply  say No to online activation.<br /><br /><br />Hell even a mix of steam and IDs key system would be nice the key system checks the key while you are on the net and if you want to play online you have to jump through the extra hoops of registration and such but to prevent a 50$ or more boxed retail game from installing or playing because of a online activation system is a strong deciding factor in weather or not I will put up with the game.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p187136" date="Posted: Thu Aug 23, 2007 4:31

lot about XP the registry bloat and after awhile it tends to lag and slow down not to mention the damage crashes dose to it(I have had DX be damaged at least 2 times in the past year and guess what you can not simply reinstall it to fix it you have to reinstall the OS....),from everythign I have read its better to make a 100% backup of a fresh install or to reinstall,I don't have the space  for a backup so I do something called mantanace to it by reinstalling it because its more a best of burden than a OS.<br /><br />Oh and yes I run defrag and scandisk every 2 weeks it dose not seem to help once the registry gets past a certain point,I also run my computer 24/7 because it is better not to restart it a lot int eh same day.<br /><br />You seem to think since I dare install it more than once I am breaking the law,hell MS thinks that and thus why I try very hard to fight against corporate nonsense like this.<br /><br />Tell me what is your personal limit on online activation you have to register the game and give your name and number and DOB half the time they hold in it sa list to sell off to the highest bidder or use it for inhouse statistical data,ect,ect,ect<br /><br />There is always a certain amount of worry about giving away my name and address and such     I try and limit as much as possible and find the invasive tactics of most online activation systems disturbing I would like a balance between them, Dark messiah used a inresting  setup if they could use steam to enable online play and then have it where you can avoid that by just install SP I would like it a lot more but they do not give you that choice thats why for retail games I simply  say No to online activation.<br /><br /><br />Hell even a mix of steam and IDs key system would be nice the key system checks the key while you are on the net and if you want to play online you have to jump through the extra hoops of registration and such but to prevent a 50$ or more boxed retail game from installing or playing because of a online activation system is a strong deciding factor in weather or not I will put up with the game.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p187136" date="Posted: Thu Aug 23, 2007 4:31

I loved every bit of it &amp; played it every night until I beat it.  Not only MUCH better then Doom 3 &amp; Quake 4, but it REALLY showed what the D3 engine can do.  The gravity work was way above what I expected, so was the portal usage.  Story was one of the most engrossing ones ever in a video game.   I also love all the extra tid-bits you could pay attention to if you wanted (like art bell) but the story still progressed even if you didn't want to (which is unlike HL2 imho, which really required you to pay attentions to most details to understand why things are happening).  
<br /><br />I've noticed a few things that were never explained inthe game though &amp; I'm hoping some people here know/have theories:
<br /><br />1) women aren't processed?  Only men are killed at the start (like grandfather).
<br /><br />2) children aren't processed either?
<br /><br />3) what's up with the white wraiths?  They possessed the kids (apparently only girls) &amp; aren't limited to the sphere (as in an art bell call).  Strangely, the art book that came with the tin box version of prey all shows boy-possessed kids, but only possessed girls made it in the game?
<br /><br />4) is the whole point of the sphere to harvest planets to keep on living?  In the game there's no other point (told in the plot).
<br /><br />5) the doom easter egg was too funny.  Not only was it a punch at doom, it was near identical to the DN3D one!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p169213" date="Posted: Sat Feb 03, 2007 7:21 am "><author>Gabrobot</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">The Happy Friar wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">1) women aren't processed?

<br /><br />I also loved the level design.  Unlike every other game out there (ever), the levels are the puzzles.

I'd say that Sam Fisher [Micheal Ironside] voice was pretty good, not perfect, but above the average. Though I think sometimes it was 'drowned'. Alyx from Hl2 was ok, that black dudes voice from Avp2 [and FEAR?] was really good. Not too overacted, but still charismatic and not the one you'd forget. Prey's Tommys voice was way too overacted, annoying and it was mentioned on bunch of gaming boards I've visited too so thats not just my opinion.

Here in NL having basic internetaccess is free in a lot of areas (wireless free accounts) or costs just under 30$ per month.

This principle is itself frequently referred to as Godwin's Law. It is considered poor form to raise arbitrarily such a comparison with the motive of ending the thread. There is a widely recognized codicil that any such ulterior-motive invocation of Godwin's Law will be unsuccessful (this is sometimes referred to as "Quirk's Exception").[5]<br /><br />Godwin's Law does not apply to discussions directly addressing genocide, propaganda, or other mainstays of the Nazi regime. Instead, it applies to inappropriate, inordinate, or hyperbolic comparisons of other situations (or one's opponent) with Hitler or Nazis or their actions.</div><br /><br />- The current salesnumbers show differently, Steam is a huge success and the number of support calls has lowered drasticly since it's introduction a couple of years ago. There are many redundant servers and it has many perks. I was a fervent anti-steam lobbiest but all my arguments against it have been debunked. I've not seen any valid argument against Steam since. It is, by far, the best way to stop pirates from pirating the crap out of honest game-developers that need to earn a living.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p185069" date="Posted: Fri Aug 03, 2007 10:16 am "><author>iceheart</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">ZippyDSMlee wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">der_ton wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">Zombie13 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I guess it all comes down to personal preference, I love steam because where ever I go in the world (Lived in 3 different countries in the last 3 years) I can just download my games off of steam onto my new pc without requiring any discs, that to me is groovy <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320003901im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div><br />That's a point on the plus side for Steam, true, but in the end I would rather be dependant on CDs than on Steam and Valve's mercy.</div><br /><br />Have you tried D2D? its 100% indapendant from the net,once you download it of coarse <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320003901im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />I just refuse to touch steam not after the issues with HL2 I had and not with it insisting you need to the net to play or install games.</div><br /><br />D2D is pathetic, and you know why?

lot about XP the registry bloat and after awhile it tends to lag and slow down not to mention the damage crashes dose to it(I have had DX be damaged at least 2 times in the past year and guess what you can not simply reinstall it to fix it you have to reinstall the OS....),from everythign I have read its better to make a 100% backup of a fresh install or to reinstall,I don't have the space  for a backup so I do something called mantanace to it by reinstalling it because its more a best of burden than a OS.<br /><br />Oh and yes I run defrag and scandisk every 2 weeks it dose not seem to help once the registry gets past a certain point,I also run my computer 24/7 because it is better not to restart it a lot int eh same day.<br /><br />You seem to think since I dare install it more than once I am breaking the law,hell MS thinks that and thus why I try very hard to fight against corporate nonsense like this.<br /><br />Tell me what is your personal limit on online activation you have to register the game and give your name and number and DOB half the time they hold in it sa list to sell off to the highest bidder or use it for inhouse statistical data,ect,ect,ect<br /><br />There is always a certain amount of worry about giving away my name and address and such     I try and limit as much as possible and find the invasive tactics of most online activation systems disturbing I would like a balance between them, Dark messiah used a inresting  setup if they could use steam to enable online play and then have it where you can avoid that by just install SP I would like it a lot more but they do not give you that choice thats why for retail games I simply  say No to online activation.<br /><br /><br />Hell even a mix of steam and IDs key system would be nice the key system checks the key while you are on the net and if you want to play online you have to jump through the extra hoops of registration and such but to prevent a 50$ or more boxed retail game from installing or playing because of a online activation system is a strong deciding factor in weather or not I will put up with the game.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p187136" date="Posted: Thu Aug 23, 2007 4:31

lot about XP the registry bloat and after awhile it tends to lag and slow down not to mention the damage crashes dose to it(I have had DX be damaged at least 2 times in the past year and guess what you can not simply reinstall it to fix it you have to reinstall the OS....),from everythign I have read its better to make a 100% backup of a fresh install or to reinstall,I don't have the space  for a backup so I do something called mantanace to it by reinstalling it because its more a best of burden than a OS.<br /><br />Oh and yes I run defrag and scandisk every 2 weeks it dose not seem to help once the registry gets past a certain point,I also run my computer 24/7 because it is better not to restart it a lot int eh same day.<br /><br />You seem to think since I dare install it more than once I am breaking the law,hell MS thinks that and thus why I try very hard to fight against corporate nonsense like this.<br /><br />Tell me what is your personal limit on online activation you have to register the game and give your name and number and DOB half the time they hold in it sa list to sell off to the highest bidder or use it for inhouse statistical data,ect,ect,ect<br /><br />There is always a certain amount of worry about giving away my name and address and such     I try and limit as much as possible and find the invasive tactics of most online activation systems disturbing I would like a balance between them, Dark messiah used a inresting  setup if they could use steam to enable online play and then have it where you can avoid that by just install SP I would like it a lot more but they do not give you that choice thats why for retail games I simply  say No to online activation.<br /><br /><br />Hell even a mix of steam and IDs key system would be nice the key system checks the key while you are on the net and if you want to play online you have to jump through the extra hoops of registration and such but to prevent a 50$ or more boxed retail game from installing or playing because of a online activation system is a strong deciding factor in weather or not I will put up with the game.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p187136" date="Posted: Thu Aug 23, 2007 4:31

I loved every bit of it &amp; played it every night until I beat it.  Not only MUCH better then Doom 3 &amp; Quake 4, but it REALLY showed what the D3 engine can do.  The gravity work was way above what I expected, so was the portal usage.  Story was one of the most engrossing ones ever in a video game.   I also love all the extra tid-bits you could pay attention to if you wanted (like art bell) but the story still progressed even if you didn't want to (which is unlike HL2 imho, which really required you to pay attentions to most details to understand why things are happening).  
<br /><br />I've noticed a few things that were never explained inthe game though &amp; I'm hoping some people here know/have theories:
<br /><br />1) women aren't processed?  Only men are killed at the start (like grandfather).
<br /><br />2) children aren't processed either?
<br /><br />3) what's up with the white wraiths?  They possessed the kids (apparently only girls) &amp; aren't limited to the sphere (as in an art bell call).  Strangely, the art book that came with the tin box version of prey all shows boy-possessed kids, but only possessed girls made it in the game?
<br /><br />4) is the whole point of the sphere to harvest planets to keep on living?  In the game there's no other point (told in the plot).
<br /><br />5) the doom easter egg was too funny.  Not only was it a punch at doom, it was near identical to the DN3D one!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p169213" date="Posted: Sat Feb 03, 2007 7:21 am "><author>Gabrobot</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">The Happy Friar wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">1) women aren't processed?

<br /><br />I also like near the end when you start to enjoy blasting baddies.

<br /><br />I also loved the level design.  Unlike every other game out there (ever), the levels are the puzzles.

I'd say that Sam Fisher [Micheal Ironside] voice was pretty good, not perfect, but above the average. Though I think sometimes it was 'drowned'. Alyx from Hl2 was ok, that black dudes voice from Avp2 [and FEAR?] was really good. Not too overacted, but still charismatic and not the one you'd forget. Prey's Tommys voice was way too overacted, annoying and it was mentioned on bunch of gaming boards I've visited too so thats not just my opinion.

<br /><br />Yeah.  Weird ship.  The only thing I never really liked was how hunters never gangbanged you with portals in a non-scripted way, ie. my little mini-mod.  Never could get the initiative to fix the gravity anomalies though.

There is a widely recognized codicil that any such ulterior-motive invocation of Godwin's Law will be unsuccessful (this is sometimes referred to as "Quirk's Exception").[5]<br /><br />Godwin's Law does not apply to discussions directly addressing genocide, propaganda, or other mainstays of the Nazi regime. Instead, it applies to inappropriate, inordinate, or hyperbolic comparisons of other situations (or one's opponent) with Hitler or Nazis or their actions.</div><br /><br />- The current salesnumbers show differently, Steam is a huge success and the number of support calls has lowered drasticly since it's introduction a couple of years ago. There are many redundant servers and it has many perks. I was a fervent anti-steam lobbiest but all my arguments against it have been debunked. I've not seen any valid argument against Steam since.

More than once I've wanted to buy stuff from D2D only to be turned down because they don't sell worldwide.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of Steam - having to run the system and authenticate online every time I want to play a game still annoys me - but at least they sell globally.

lot about XP the registry bloat and after awhile it tends to lag and slow down not to mention the damage crashes dose to it(I have had DX be damaged at least 2 times in the past year and guess what you can not simply reinstall it to fix it you have to reinstall the OS....),from everythign I have read its better to make a 100% backup of a fresh install or to reinstall,I don't have the space  for a backup so I do something called mantanace to it by reinstalling it because its more a best of burden than a OS.<br /><br />Oh and yes I run defrag and scandisk every 2 weeks it dose not seem to help once the registry gets past a certain point,I also run my computer 24/7 because it is better not to restart it a lot int eh same day.<br /><br />You seem to think since I dare install it more than once I am breaking the law,hell MS thinks that and thus why I try very hard to fight against corporate nonsense like this.<br /><br />Tell me what is your personal limit on online activation you have to register the game and give your name and number and DOB half the time they hold in it sa list to sell off to the highest bidder or use it for inhouse statistical data,ect,ect,ect<br /><br />There is always a certain amount of worry about giving away my name and address and such     I try and limit as much as possible and find the invasive tactics of most online activation systems disturbing I would like a balance between them, Dark messiah used a inresting  setup if they could use steam to enable online play and then have it where you can avoid that by just install SP I would like it a lot more but they do not give you that choice thats why for retail games I simply  say No to online activation.<br /><br /><br />Hell even a mix of steam and IDs key system would be nice the key system checks the key while you are on the net and if you want to play online you have to jump through the extra hoops of registration and such but to prevent a 50$ or more boxed retail game from installing or playing because of a online activation system is a strong deciding factor in weather or not I will put up with the game.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p187136" date="Posted: Thu Aug 23, 2007 4:31

I loved every bit of it &amp; played it every night until I beat it.  Not only MUCH better then Doom 3 &amp; Quake 4, but it REALLY showed what the D3 engine can do.  The gravity work was way above what I expected, so was the portal usage.  Story was one of the most engrossing ones ever in a video game.   I also love all the extra tid-bits you could pay attention to if you wanted (like art bell) but the story still progressed even if you didn't want to (which is unlike HL2 imho, which really required you to pay attentions to most details to understand why things are happening).  
<br /><br />I've noticed a few things that were never explained inthe game though &amp; I'm hoping some people here know/have theories:
<br /><br />1) women aren't processed?  Only men are killed at the start (like grandfather).
<br /><br />2) children aren't processed either?
<br /><br />3) what's up with the white wraiths?  They possessed the kids (apparently only girls) &amp; aren't limited to the sphere (as in an art bell call).  Strangely, the art book that came with the tin box version of prey all shows boy-possessed kids, but only possessed girls made it in the game?
<br /><br />4) is the whole point of the sphere to harvest planets to keep on living?  In the game there's no other point (told in the plot).
<br /><br />5) the doom easter egg was too funny.

<br /><br />I especially love what he says &amp; the timing.  Infact, right before he mentions he's going to puke from all the initial grav changes, that's exactly what I thought.  I'd imagine they had people play through &amp; then say their reactions.  
<br /><br />I also like near the end when you start to enjoy blasting baddies.  It's about time a character you play enjoys blowing things up as much as you do.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320003754im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />I thought the weapon sounds were good.  
<br /><br />I also loved the level design.  Unlike every other game out there (ever), the levels are the puzzles.  There's no "follow the walkway" for most of the game, it's nearly all "ok, i need to get over there...  how can i?"</div>]]></body></post><post id="p169268" date="Posted: Sat Feb 03, 2007 7:24 pm "><author>Regulator</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Good voice acting is realy hard to find in games. I'd say that Sam Fisher [Micheal Ironside] voice was pretty good, not perfect, but above the average. Though I think sometimes it was 'drowned'. Alyx from Hl2 was ok, that black dudes voice from Avp2 [and FEAR?] was really good. Not too overacted, but still charismatic and not the one you'd forget. Prey's Tommys voice was way too overacted, annoying and it was mentioned on bunch of gaming boards I've visited too so thats not just my opinion. Imho the only cool thing in Prey was menu music, it was really good, epic, but melodic'n stuff.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p169271" date="Posted: Sat Feb 03, 2007 7:33 pm "><author>Phobos</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I've always wanted to grab a copy of the game, I just haven't picked one up yet :'(</div>]]></body></post><post id="p169288" date="Posted: Sat Feb 03, 2007 9:29 pm "><author>Arklon</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">The Happy Friar wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I especially love what he says &amp; the timing.

There is a widely recognized codicil that any such ulterior-motive invocation of Godwin's Law will be unsuccessful (this is sometimes referred to as "Quirk's Exception").[5]<br /><br />Godwin's Law does not apply to discussions directly addressing genocide, propaganda, or other mainstays of the Nazi regime. Instead, it applies to inappropriate, inordinate, or hyperbolic comparisons of other situations (or one's opponent) with Hitler or Nazis or their actions.</div><br /><br />- The current salesnumbers show differently, Steam is a huge success and the number of support calls has lowered drasticly since it's introduction a couple of years ago. There are many redundant servers and it has many perks. I was a fervent anti-steam lobbiest but all my arguments against it have been debunked. I've not seen any valid argument against Steam since.

lot about XP the registry bloat and after awhile it tends to lag and slow down not to mention the damage crashes dose to it(I have had DX be damaged at least 2 times in the past year and guess what you can not simply reinstall it to fix it you have to reinstall the OS....),from everythign I have read its better to make a 100% backup of a fresh install or to reinstall,I don't have the space  for a backup so I do something called mantanace to it by reinstalling it because its more a best of burden than a OS.<br /><br />Oh and yes I run defrag and scandisk every 2 weeks it dose not seem to help once the registry gets past a certain point,I also run my computer 24/7 because it is better not to restart it a lot int eh same day.<br /><br />You seem to think since I dare install it more than once I am breaking the law,hell MS thinks that and thus why I try very hard to fight against corporate nonsense like this.<br /><br />Tell me what is your personal limit on online activation you have to register the game and give your name and number and DOB half the time they hold in it sa list to sell off to the highest bidder or use it for inhouse statistical data,ect,ect,ect<br /><br />There is always a certain amount of worry about giving away my name and address and such     I try and limit as much as possible and find the invasive tactics of most online activation systems disturbing I would like a balance between them, Dark messiah used a inresting  setup if they could use steam to enable online play and then have it where you can avoid that by just install SP I would like it a lot more but they do not give you that choice thats why for retail games I simply  say No to online activation.<br /><br /><br />Hell even a mix of steam and IDs key system would be nice the key system checks the key while you are on the net and if you want to play online you have to jump through the extra hoops of registration and such but to prevent a 50$ or more boxed retail game from installing or playing because of a online activation system is a strong deciding factor in weather or not I will put up with the game.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p187136" date="Posted: Thu Aug 23, 2007 4:31

degrading into a sluggish mess.<br /><br />Even most of the registry utilities can not effectively deal with the bloat,corruption and errors,thus why a reinstall is a must for a spry and fresh feeling OS.<br /><br />Norton ghost is one of the best ways to back it up,you put it on a HD on a USB box and it wont get screwed up by being on all the time.<br /><br />USB box I have, a spare HDD not so much LOL<br /><br />I have my WGA tools to disable activation and crap and I get most of my updates from Autopatcher putting updates on a CD is a must and I can install them all in one setting not wait for updates to download install and repeat 1-3 times,I wish MS gave you that option of downloading the updates and storing them so you can install them when you need to..<br /><br /><br />Ooo
