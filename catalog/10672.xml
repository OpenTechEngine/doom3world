It's become a battle between me and lightwave, and I don't have any intentions of backing down here...&#13;
<br/><br/>
Okay, I'm a Lightwave newbie. I only been using it for about 3 days now...so keep that in mind. Right now I'm trying to make a rather complicated normalmap and up til a couple of hours ago it was going nice and smoothly. To give you an idea of what I'm doing, <a href="/web/20061012182647/http://208.49.149.118/TheDarkMod/screenshots/renzatic/doornormal2.jpg" target="_blank" class="postlink">here's</a> a quick screenshot.&#13;
<br/><br/>
For the wood panels I'd make a flat box in another layer, hit shift+r, and stencil out the shape on the surface and bevel it from there. It worked fine for the first 4 panels, but on the 5th and up it quit working properly. I'd go through the same process, but instead of making a seperate poly on the face I'm working with, it'd either draw a half complete poly with missing vertex points, or mix up and cross all the points weirdly. &#13;
<br/><br/>
I've tried cutting the face I'm working with, tried stenciling more than one shape at a time, I've even tried boolean functions but so far nothing has worked. Any idea what's up here?</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

I've pretty much decided that I'm gonna have to redo the whole thing (again) to really do it right. I tried the edge tool, but considering how the model is built there isn't much I can do with it without practically starting from scratch anyway....so I figured I might as well.&#13;

I've got a good idea of what I did wrong though, so this next go round should be a helluva lot better.&#13;

Thanks for the help and the tutorials, Rich. I'll check em out and see if I can come up with something cool to show in the next couple of days. <img src="/web/20061012182647im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0"/></span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

<br/><br/>
I've started working on the arched panels towards the top of the door, and up to the point where I started beveling the smaller panels it was going nice and smooth. I realised I couldn't do the arches the same way I did the lower panels because some of the vertex points met up weirdly when I stretched the mesh to make the surface. So I took the points from the poly above, realigned them to match the lower panel, and was gonna draw in my own polys like I had done with the arches above. It seems to work fine, the editor displays the poly in the shape it should be, but the surface seems to bleed out beyond the edges and looks like it's meeting it from top angle to bottom angle.&#13;

I've also tried dividing the shape I'm going for into smaller segments but it still does the same thing. Any idea what's up?&#13;
<br/><br/>
Edit: Hmm, think I just fixed it. All I had to do was merge points and everything ended up looking exactly like it should. I'm still kinda weary though...it can't be that easy. <img src="/web/20061012182647im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0"/></span><span class="gensmall"/></td>
