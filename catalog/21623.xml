I will list them in level of importance...<br /><br />1. Someone familiar making animated meshes in any program and putting them into doom 3.<br /><br />2. Someone familiar making static meshes in any program and putting them into doom 3.<br /><br />3. Someone familiar with textures to optimize existing textures and add new ones.<br /><br />4. I need more map makers. We currently only have 1, large map that still could use more detailing.<br /><br />5. A coder with some ideas or pseudo code on creating a server-side "character sheet" of sorts to keep up with stats and inventory.<br /><br />6. Someone who can produce media such as new screen shots, web page additions, and youtube videos.<br /><br /><br /><br />I hope to hear from anyone interested. Nothing much has happened with MyDevil since its release and I would hate to see the project die. <br /><br />Check out the mod on the URL in my sig <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225104733im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />** This is a completely open-source project for the Doom 3 modding community.
