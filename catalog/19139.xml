We would like to thank all of our contestants for their time and dedication to the Quake 4 community. It has been a pleasure watching mappers turn up the heat trying to produce some of their best work in a limited amount of time. We were incredibly pleased to have received 34 submissions from 25 map authors and our only regret in concluding this contest is that there are many wonderful levels by talented designers who have not made it into the pak. The CMP will be available soon, distributed inside the upcoming Quake 4 1.4 Beta 2 Patch.
