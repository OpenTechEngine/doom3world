The only thing I would do is assist in initializing the server and mods or hosting costume maps. So you can jump in the server's folder when ever and do some changes with your server's content and hit reload on your Admin page.<br /><br />Are you trying to connect through CSS or some other 3rd Party?<br /><br />I still have to try it I ran 2 at the same time and performance is still good. I'm going to try 4-5 this weekend.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p213951" date="Posted: Fri Apr 24, 2009 7:53 am "><author>ajm113</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Hi, it's been a long time since I been on a forum epically here.
