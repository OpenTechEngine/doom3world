<br /><br />This thread will serve as a medium to make texture/model requests.
<br /><br />I'm not sure who else is interested in making textures but I need a break from modeling so I'll take requests here.
<br /><br />I want details though. I don't want, "gimme a brick texture". I want specifics. If you can show me photos all the better.
<br /><br />That's all I can think of at the moment.

<br /><br />in particular some simple ones like below would probably be usuable on every single building we have going, it would just be a matter of changing defuse colour to make diferent coloured versions

<br /><br /><br />It would probably be a good idea to make a nice matching smooth stone texture to go with it so people who use the cornice texture will have matching walls to go with it. 
<br /><br /><br />A good set of classical textures could be used to make many diverse looking buildings as basically most classical buildings are built from the same lego set.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p71828" date="Posted: Thu Jan 13, 2005 12:15 am "><author>rich_is_bored</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">It doesn't look too bad.

<br /><br />I was going to propose trims, but if you could do a proper top for the AC vent texture I'm using here (left):

<br /><br />I can send you the AC vent texture normal/specular maps if you want.
<br /><br />Another one I'd appreciate is a texture for the window frame:

<br /><br />Also, in regards to these new requests, could both of you give me rough dimensions of the faces that you plan to applying these textures to just so I have a good idea what is too big/small.
<br /><br />For instance, what's the size of this AC vent?

It has white window frames and black bits for the glass. I made the black bits super shiny with the spec map and it looks kind of decent from a distance and it makes the building appear as if there are no lights on inside. However i thought things could look better if there were some with lights on and some with lights off. If you like i can send you the texture (pm me your email) or you can just get it from the next test build when goliath finishes it. You will probably get a better idea of what im talking about by looking closely at the second picture in my block5 thread.

<br /><br />The AC vent texture is 512 x 512 (the brush itself is only 64 x 64 -- just to retain that incredible detail). I'm sure we'll optimise this later if video mem starts being an issue.
<br /><br />As for the window frames, I'd actually prefer if you just did the wooden trim as a... say, 64 x 16 texture that we can then resize and fit the window frames as needed.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p72110" date="Posted: Fri Jan 14, 2005 10:20 pm "><author>rich_is_bored</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">The <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121122750im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/templates/subSilver/images/lang_english/icon_email.gif" alt="Image" /> button at the bottom of my posts is the email address I use.

<br /><br />Got the files.
<br /><br />I'm not too sure about using a single flat texture to represent both the trim and the panes of glass.
<br /><br />It's perfectly fine for dark rooms where detail behind the glass isn't visible but in lit areas I don't believe it's going to work out very well.
<br /><br />I assume, in the case of these lit windows you're wanting me to draw the space behind the glass - desks, chairs, general officespace - into the texture? If so, my intention is to draw backlit blinds or curtains because the depth of a full fledged room can't be conveyed very well by a texture at the proximity these windows will be to the player.
<br /><br />The best method would be to flesh out the interior of the building so that lit areas behind the glass are visible but I'll run with the ball here and see what I can come up with.
<br /><br />@Mordenkainen:
<br /><br />Am I missing something?
<br /><br />The map you sent me is named block6 when you're supposedly working on block 7. The geometry in the file seems to support the idea that this is the wrong map.
<br /><br />That would explain why the section with the vents doesn't exist and none of the textures that are being used match what's in your screenshots.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p72213" date="Posted: Sat Jan 15, 2005 11:42 am "><author>Mordenkainen</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">rich_is_bored wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">@Mordenkainen:<br /><br />Am I missing something?<br /><br />The map you sent me is named block6 when you're supposedly working on block 7.

It has white window frames and black bits for the glass. I made the black bits super shiny with the spec map and it looks kind of decent from a distance and it makes the building appear as if there are no lights on inside. However i thought things could look better if there were some with lights on and some with lights off. If you like i can send you the texture (pm me your email) or you can just get it from the next test build when goliath finishes it. You will probably get a better idea of what im talking about by looking closely at the second picture in my block5 thread.

<br /><br />The AC vent texture is 512 x 512 (the brush itself is only 64 x 64 -- just to retain that incredible detail). I'm sure we'll optimise this later if video mem starts being an issue.

<br /><br />Got the files.
<br /><br />I'm not too sure about using a single flat texture to represent both the trim and the panes of glass.
<br /><br />It's perfectly fine for dark rooms where detail behind the glass isn't visible but in lit areas I don't believe it's going to work out very well.
<br /><br />I assume, in the case of these lit windows you're wanting me to draw the space behind the glass - desks, chairs, general officespace - into the texture? If so, my intention is to draw backlit blinds or curtains because the depth of a full fledged room can't be conveyed very well by a texture at the proximity these windows will be to the player.
<br /><br />The best method would be to flesh out the interior of the building so that lit areas behind the glass are visible but I'll run with the ball here and see what I can come up with.
<br /><br />@Mordenkainen:
<br /><br />Am I missing something?
<br /><br />The map you sent me is named block6 when you're supposedly working on block 7. The geometry in the file seems to support the idea that this is the wrong map.

Its just that I have had minimal success getting stuff from lightwave in to Doom3, and I think since there is already ample talent in that area contributing to the project, if I give someone what they need from Max, and then get them to convert it to .lwo, and bake the bump maps and whatever else is involved, it would be a lot quicker.
<br /><br />Anyway, if someone wants to help, that'd be great <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121121943im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p76683" date="Posted: Wed Feb 09, 2005 3:52 am "><author>rich_is_bored</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Actually I think I'm one of the only "modelers" on the project which is a bit of a shame because I don't consider myself a pro at this and I was expecting a bit more help in this area when I started this thread.
<br /><br />Anyway, I'll try to help you out and all but I'm really busting my balls on Mordenkainen's gargoyle (not proud enough of it to show screens yet) so unless someone else can lend a hand here it's going to be awhile before I can get around to it.
<br /><br />I'm just curious but, if you have MAX what exactly was the reasoning behind trying to export to *.lwo? You should have been able to export directly from MAX to *.ase.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p76700" date="Posted: Wed Feb 09, 2005 6:49 am "><author>GuyBrave</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Well, I dont know if Im doing it wrong or what, but every time I try and use an .ase from max, it always comes out really crazy in game.

Anyone with even the remotest amount of experience with moddling could produce what I'm after, literally just a white rectangle will do.
<br /><br />Just had the idea that with this, you could produce a gui with a transparent background and create pieces of paper with anything you want written on them, at very high detail (thanks to the scalable text in Guis) at a fraction of memory and space usage.

<br /><br />Is it possible that you don't feel comfortable about the fronds because you know deep down that they could not be carved in real stone?  The problem is not the details but the amount they jut out and how slender they are. They would just snap off either whilst being carved or the pilaster being put in position.  Egyptian columns are the only ones I know of that have similar but more subdued frond motifs like this, but Corinthian also have a frond like device. 
<br /><br />Have a look at these sites and see if you can get ideas...

<br /><br />as for the fonds i think they look fine. They're meant to be delicate. ive seen ancient Roman version of this with all the ends snapped off. i think once the model has been reduced, textured and put on top of my building they wont look so fragile
<br /><br />anyway it looks really really good. ive seen quite a few cad and max versions and this one looks by far the best. really looking forward to having it in my building.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p74351" date="Posted: Wed Jan 26, 2005 11:03 pm "><author>radix2</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">rich_is_bored wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">radix2 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Is it possible that you don't feel comfortable about the fronds because you know deep down that they could not be carved in real stone?</div><br /><br />Actually, I'm quite comfortable with the fronds.

<br /><br />I've got a low poly model made and I've rendered a normal map. I haven't really started on a diffuse texture yet.
<br /><br />At the moment, I'm experimenting with drawing a sort of global illumination type map because everything is generally going to be illuminated, to a degree, from the sky above. Here's what I've come up with so far...

Of course, the end result won't be so dark. I'm just toying with the idea a bit right now. What I've drawn so far will be combinded with the diffusemap in PS.
<br /><br />I've been using a combination of exporting pieces of the model with lightwave and painting "shadow" areas with tattoo.
<br /><br />I think when I've finished this and mordy's gargoyle I'm going to go and rework the fountain model using this technique.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p75194" date="Posted: Mon Jan 31, 2005 12:04 am "><author>blushing_bride</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">That looks amazing, much better then i could of ever hoped for (EDIT im glad you decided to make a model instead of a texture now).

Not having tried it myself I can't be sure, however, for this particular piece being far away from the player I don't think it would be too noticeable. And if it is, rich can tone down the shadows when he bakes them.
<br /><br />rich: that piece looks excellent! And I thought you wouldn't be working on the gargoyle, very nice.
<br /><br />EDIT: wait, I just remembered something, if rich would bake the shadows into a separate texture the material could have:
<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">{<br />        if ( _light_script_var_here &gt; _light_script_value_here )<br />        blend add<br />        map whatever/rock_gi.tga<br />    }</div>

<br /><br />I'm baking illumination but I'm not using a "directional" light as in a point light or spot light, and I'm only capturing the lighting, not the shadows.
<br /><br />What I've done is make a dome with a floor. The dome is luminous, the floor is not. I've enabled radiosity and set the render up for 2 bounces.
<br /><br />The lighting will not appear directional because it's pretty much is coming from every direction. But, it won't wash everything out because it will be stronger from above than below because the light coming from below has bounced.
<br /><br />Now, all you do at this point is place the low poly model in the dome, disable shadows for the object, and bake the lighting.
<br /><br />Then you take the resulting texture and hand paint on top of it in photoshop and tattoo to help match it to the bumps in the normal map.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p75883" date="Posted: Thu Feb 03, 2005 11:03 pm "><author>BEERman</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I've got a request for a model for Block-10b If someone would be so kind.

<br /><br /><br />It would probably be a good idea to make a nice matching smooth stone texture to go with it so people who use the cornice texture will have matching walls to go with it.

It has white window frames and black bits for the glass. I made the black bits super shiny with the spec map and it looks kind of decent from a distance and it makes the building appear as if there are no lights on inside. However i thought things could look better if there were some with lights on and some with lights off. If you like i can send you the texture (pm me your email) or you can just get it from the next test build when goliath finishes it.

<br /><br />The AC vent texture is 512 x 512 (the brush itself is only 64 x 64 -- just to retain that incredible detail). I'm sure we'll optimise this later if video mem starts being an issue.
<br /><br />As for the window frames, I'd actually prefer if you just did the wooden trim as a... say, 64 x 16 texture that we can then resize and fit the window frames as needed.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p72110" date="Posted: Fri Jan 14, 2005 10:20 pm "><author>rich_is_bored</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">The <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121165821im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/templates/subSilver/images/lang_english/icon_email.gif" alt="Image" /> button at the bottom of my posts is the email address I use.

<br /><br />Got the files.
<br /><br />I'm not too sure about using a single flat texture to represent both the trim and the panes of glass.
<br /><br />It's perfectly fine for dark rooms where detail behind the glass isn't visible but in lit areas I don't believe it's going to work out very well.
<br /><br />I assume, in the case of these lit windows you're wanting me to draw the space behind the glass - desks, chairs, general officespace - into the texture? If so, my intention is to draw backlit blinds or curtains because the depth of a full fledged room can't be conveyed very well by a texture at the proximity these windows will be to the player.
<br /><br />The best method would be to flesh out the interior of the building so that lit areas behind the glass are visible but I'll run with the ball here and see what I can come up with.
<br /><br />@Mordenkainen:
<br /><br />Am I missing something?
<br /><br />The map you sent me is named block6 when you're supposedly working on block 7. The geometry in the file seems to support the idea that this is the wrong map.
<br /><br />That would explain why the section with the vents doesn't exist and none of the textures that are being used match what's in your screenshots.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p72213" date="Posted: Sat Jan 15, 2005 11:42 am "><author>Mordenkainen</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">rich_is_bored wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">@Mordenkainen:<br /><br />Am I missing something?<br /><br />The map you sent me is named block6 when you're supposedly working on block 7.

<br /><br />but I need help to model a joystick and coin box for it. Now, I can model them in Max and give them to someone else to make usable if thats easier. Its just that I have had minimal success getting stuff from lightwave in to Doom3, and I think since there is already ample talent in that area contributing to the project, if I give someone what they need from Max, and then get them to convert it to .lwo, and bake the bump maps and whatever else is involved, it would be a lot quicker.
<br /><br />Anyway, if someone wants to help, that'd be great <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121121943im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p76683" date="Posted: Wed Feb 09, 2005 3:52 am "><author>rich_is_bored</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Actually I think I'm one of the only "modelers" on the project which is a bit of a shame because I don't consider myself a pro at this and I was expecting a bit more help in this area when I started this thread.

<br /><br />I'm just curious but, if you have MAX what exactly was the reasoning behind trying to export to *.lwo?

<br /><br />Just had the idea that with this, you could produce a gui with a transparent background and create pieces of paper with anything you want written on them, at very high detail (thanks to the scalable text in Guis) at a fraction of memory and space usage.

Probably producing one or two dynamic position, brightness, target and colour changing lights that dance all over the room and are amazingly fun to watch is the best idea.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p74019" date="Posted: Tue Jan 25, 2005 5:14 pm "><author>Gazado</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Good point there. I understand what your saying about the disco not suiting RATM , I just said that because its whats in the video at the moment <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121121828im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />I was thinking a disco-ball with a projected light and two circle lights that focus around the room and change colour. And have those tube lights done as a texture so it doesnt actually emmit light.
<br /><br />I'll get onto that though once I get the go-ahead to do the inside of the block - otherwise I'll work on the outside a bit more <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121121828im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p74325" date="Posted: Wed Jan 26, 2005 9:08 pm "><author>rich_is_bored</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Okay, here's where I'm at with the pilaster.

<br /><br />Is it possible that you don't feel comfortable about the fronds because you know deep down that they could not be carved in real stone?  The problem is not the details but the amount they jut out and how slender they are. They would just snap off either whilst being carved or the pilaster being put in position.  Egyptian columns are the only ones I know of that have similar but more subdued frond motifs like this, but Corinthian also have a frond like device. 
<br /><br />Have a look at these sites and see if you can get ideas...

<br /><br />Look at the right side of the photo. They stick out quite a bit.

<br /><br />as for the fonds i think they look fine. They're meant to be delicate. ive seen ancient Roman version of this with all the ends snapped off. i think once the model has been reduced, textured and put on top of my building they wont look so fragile

<br /><br />Ah I see.

<br /><br />I've got a low poly model made and I've rendered a normal map. I haven't really started on a diffuse texture yet.
<br /><br />At the moment, I'm experimenting with drawing a sort of global illumination type map because everything is generally going to be illuminated, to a degree, from the sky above. Here's what I've come up with so far...
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Without GI</span>
<br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121121828im_/http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v36/rich_is_bored/D3W%20-%20D3CIT%20Texture%20Request/Tex_Req_6_noGI.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">With GI</span>

Of course, the end result won't be so dark. I'm just toying with the idea a bit right now. What I've drawn so far will be combinded with the diffusemap in PS.
<br /><br />I've been using a combination of exporting pieces of the model with lightwave and painting "shadow" areas with tattoo.
<br /><br />I think when I've finished this and mordy's gargoyle I'm going to go and rework the fountain model using this technique.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p75194" date="Posted: Mon Jan 31, 2005 12:04 am "><author>blushing_bride</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">That looks amazing, much better then i could of ever hoped for (EDIT im glad you decided to make a model instead of a texture now).

Not having tried it myself I can't be sure, however, for this particular piece being far away from the player I don't think it would be too noticeable. And if it is, rich can tone down the shadows when he bakes them.
<br /><br />rich: that piece looks excellent! And I thought you wouldn't be working on the gargoyle, very nice.
<br /><br />EDIT: wait, I just remembered something, if rich would bake the shadows into a separate texture the material could have:
<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">{<br />        if ( _light_script_var_here &gt; _light_script_value_here )<br />        blend add<br />        map whatever/rock_gi.tga<br />    }</div>
<br /><br />so that, for instance, the map would only be applied if the sun was up and about. You could even go further and have several gi maps and apply them XOR depending on the sun/moon's position.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p75401" date="Posted: Mon Jan 31, 2005 10:51 pm "><author>rich_is_bored</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Yes and no.
<br /><br />I'm baking illumination but I'm not using a "directional" light as in a point light or spot light, and I'm only capturing the lighting, not the shadows.
<br /><br />What I've done is make a dome with a floor. The dome is luminous, the floor is not. I've enabled radiosity and set the render up for 2 bounces.
<br /><br />The lighting will not appear directional because it's pretty much is coming from every direction. But, it won't wash everything out because it will be stronger from above than below because the light coming from below has bounced.
<br /><br />Now, all you do at this point is place the low poly model in the dome, disable shadows for the object, and bake the lighting.
<br /><br />Then you take the resulting texture and hand paint on top of it in photoshop and tattoo to help match it to the bumps in the normal map.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p75883" date="Posted: Thu Feb 03, 2005 11:03 pm "><author>BEERman</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I've got a request for a model for Block-10b If someone would be so kind.

<br /><br />Excellent. Do you know the gargoyle statue in Quake 3? I just would like one (without wings) so it can stand perched on my archway:
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121121828/http://img34.exs.cx/my.php?loc=img34&amp;image=b7195e3mv.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121121828im_/http://img34.exs.cx/img34/962/b7195e3mv.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />Look on the top right hand side of the shot. That cube is supposed to be in the place of the gargoyle. I figure that the best look would be for the gargoyle to be hunched back, looking downwards into the street.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p76091" date="Posted: Sat Feb 05, 2005 9:01 am "><author>rich_is_bored</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Hmm, not alot of space up there.
