<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 134%; line-height: normal"><span style="font-weight: bold">Introduction</span></span>
<br /><br />When writing particle scripts you use shapes to describe the source or velocity of a particle system. These parameters aren't very straight forward and it can be quite confusing trying to figure them out as you go. Here's my attempt at clearing things up.
<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 134%; line-height: normal"><span style="font-weight: bold">Shapes and Their Parameters</span></span>
<br /><br />In Doom 3 the shapes available are lines, spheres, boxes, cylinders, cones, planes, gaussian blobs and points. Let's go over each shape and it's parameters. We will use the command initialVelocity in these examples.
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Point</span>

Instead it draws a diagonal line.<br /><br />If you try using it yourself though you see that the parameters do work in the manner posted above, it just doesn't draw a sphere like it suggests. Perhaps it's a bug or the code is incomplete?<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Box</span><br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20121102225531im_/http://img12.photobucket.com/albums/v36/rich_is_bored/D3W%20-%20Particles%20and%20Shapes/Box.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />...<span style="color: green"><span style="font-weight: bold">Definition</span></span>: This shape defines two points in space using x, y and z coordinates.

Two radius are defined to form two spheres. (At the moment, the game will only accept the parameters for a single point and radius.) These spheres are used to form a blob similar to a nurbs surface.<br /><br />...<span style="color: orange"><span style="font-weight: bold">Syntax</span></span>:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">initialVelocity ( shape, x, y, z, r)</div><br />...<span style="color: red"><span style="font-weight: bold">Example</span></span>:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">initialVelocity ( blob, 0, 0, 0, 20)</div><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">NOTE:</span> This shape behaves nothing like the diagram above and the syntax, although correct, cannot possibly form the shape in the diagram.<br /><br />As you can see from the syntax above, you can only define a single point and radius. This means that if blob was used in this manner it would create a sphere because there are no other points to influence the shape.<br /><br />I've tried all sorts of things to input a second point and radius but to no avail. The game will reject any blob shape with more than 4 parameters.<br /><br />This isn't all. Blob can't even draw a sphere correctly. Instead you get a shape like this from a single point.<br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20121102225531im_/http://img12.photobucket.com/albums/v36/rich_is_bored/D3W%20-%20Particles%20and%20Shapes/Blob_Ingame.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Again, I'm guessing it's a bug or the code is incomplete.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Plane</span><br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20121102225531im_/http://img12.photobucket.com/albums/v36/rich_is_bored/D3W%20-%20Particles%20and%20Shapes/Plane.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />...<span style="color: green"><span style="font-weight: bold">Definition</span></span>: This shape defines three points in space using x, y and z coordinates. The fourth point is calulated and a plane is formed.<br /><br />...<span style="color: orange"><span style="font-weight: bold">Syntax</span></span>:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">initialVelocity ( shape, x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2, x3, y3, z3 )</div><br />...<span style="color: red"><span style="font-weight: bold">Example</span></span>:<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">initialVelocity ( plane, 0, 0, -10, 0, 50, -10, 50, 0, -10 )</div><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">NOTE:</span> Each successive points' position is in relation to the last point. For instance if the absolute position of point 1 is 0,0,0; point 2 is 0,10,10; and point 3 is 0,10,20; then the parameters would be...<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">initialVelocity( plane, 0, 0, 0, 0, 10, 10, 0, 0, 10 )</div>
<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 134%; line-height: normal"><span style="font-weight: bold">Conclusion</span></span>
<br /><br />Hopefully this is enough to familiarize you with the shape parameters and in conjunction with bullet's particle tutorials you should be well on your way to creating unique particle effects.

<br /><br />Can't wait to see the fully documented SDK for Doom³ - with the interconnection of scripteable particles, levels, animations and gamelogic one should be able to provide real complex setups in a map.
