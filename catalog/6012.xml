The famous Eutetic has donated his time to present us with - you may guess it - clean shaders! Yay! &#13;

These should be the new default standard to use. &#13;

That happened to my computer aswell. I didn't think it was related to the package, but it might be the case, since I haven't installed anything else.<br/>_________________<br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/site/img/d3w.gif" border="0"/> | Additional D3++ modding links: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.modwiki.net/wiki/How_to_get_help" target="_blank" class="postlink">General help guide</a> | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.modwiki.net/" target="_blank">http://www.modwiki.net</a> | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.iddevnet.com/" target="_blank">http://www.iddevnet.com</a> | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.quake3bits.com/" target="_blank">http://www.quake3bits.com</a></span></span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

Damm... you mean the "textures/decals/spawndecal" material right?&#13;
<br/>
(and yes it's the same in V2, don't bother to DL it)&#13;
<br/><br/>
I checked and I noticed that it's commented out when I should have left it in... A result of my indecision at a time when I was juggling whether or not I should comment those out or not: before I decided to use the "dontuse.tga" qer_editorimage and before I learned about the vertexcolor parameter. This broke the methodical verification flow and caused this oversight. Matt, I should have listened to you from the beginning... damm that bloody temper of mine  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" border="0"/><br/><br/>
Oh well... Version 3 is now up. I don't mind doing the fixes and re-uploading. What bugs me is that I feel bad for the users having to re-download a 13MB pak every time and I feel like a heel for abusing pcgamemod's storage space this way.&#13;
<br/><br/>
I've re-verified the entire textures/decals family to be sure there weren't any others. Thanks for the feedback cold_Fusion, this is exactly what I need to make this thing as error-free as I can <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0"/><br/><br/>
Oh BTW, you don't need to delete the pk4 when a problem occurs, just temporarily rename to .zip and the Doom3 game won't see it. Also, if you want, you can fix it yourself easily without having to download a new version (assuming you already have V2). Here's how:&#13;
<br/><br/>
- rename the pk4 to .zip and double-click on it to open the file in wizip&#13;
<br/>
- scroll to the file decals.mtr, right-click on it and select "view with NOTEPAD.EXE"&#13;
<br/>
- scroll down to where the material "textures/decals/spawndecal" is&#13;
<br/>
- remove the // at the beginning of every line of that shader/material&#13;
<br/>
- edit the qer_editorimage parameter to "textures/editor/dontuse.tga"&#13;
<br/>
- save the file and close it, Winzip will notice the file has changed and ask you if you want to update the archive. Choose YES.&#13;
<br/>
- that's it, your pak file is fixed. Just rename it to .pk4 again and you're ready to go <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0"/><br/><br/>
But if you have a broadband connection and don't mind DL'ing a 13MB file:&#13;
