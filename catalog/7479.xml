This is what causes the long list of warnings in the Editor's console when the skins are loaded for the first time. Those skins have been commented out and the messages no longer appear. Note that I went to great lengths to make sure I didn't comment out ANY skin required by the game.
<br /><br />I also enhanced the valid skins by adding references to all the models to which a given skin can be applied. Here's an example from skins.skin:
<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">skin skins/a_hangingmonitor {<br />   models/mapobjects/monitors/hangingmonitor   models/mapobjects/monitors/a_hangingmonitor<br />   models/mapobjects/monitors/hangingmonitorpiece   models/mapobjects/monitors/a_hangingmonitorpiece<br />}</div><br /><br />The above skin can be applied to 2 models:<br /><br /><span style="color: red">models/mapobjects/monitors/hangingmonitor.lwo</span><br /><span style="color: red">models/mapobjects/monitors/hangingmonitor.ase</span><br /><br />Now by adding "model" statements with the name of the models at the beginning of the skin declaration as show below:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">skin skins/a_hangingmonitor {<br />   model models/mapobjects/monitors/hangingmonitor.lwo<br />   model models/mapobjects/monitors/hangingmonitor.ase<br />   models/mapobjects/monitors/hangingmonitor   models/mapobjects/monitors/a_hangingmonitor<br />   models/mapobjects/monitors/hangingmonitorpiece   models/mapobjects/monitors/a_hangingmonitorpiece<br />}</div>
<br /><br />This tells the Editor to place the skin in the <span style="color: red">Matching Skins</span> folder of the skin dialog window when the model is selected in the 2D view as show below:
<br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20111120052436im_/http://img66.exs.cx/img66/5574/skindialog.gif" alt="Image" /><br /><br />I find this an extremely convenient feature since it avoids the user from having to blindly search through a long list of hundreds of skins to find the one he wants.
<br /><br />This feature was implemented in some of the original skin decl's but not all of them. There were also a few in which there were typos in the "model" line which prevented the feature from working properly for those skins.
<br /><br />So I fixed all that <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20111120052436im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Now all the skins have all the proper "model" statements when applicable. Note that this feature only works with <span style="color: blue">LWO</span> and <span style="color: blue">ASE</span> models. <span style="font-weight: bold">It does NOT work with MD5 models</span> unfortunately.
<br /><br />IOW, don't expect to see the skins in the 'Matching Skins' folder for models like the <span style="color: blue">env_storagecabinet</span> entity for example, since it uses an MD5 model (because it has an animated door). LWO's and ASE's are used only for static models.
