The snow texture in Day of Defeat: Source has a specular effect.
<br /><br />I'm not sure how it's done, but some textures react to your flashlight as if they had a specular map.  I think it has to do with the way they faked the blooming as you look into the sun.  I want to say tone-mapping, but I'm not positive if that's being used.
<br /><br />Although I think you can't get that effect on anything animated, as no NPCs or other players are affected by the flashlight, which is annoying in multiplayer maps with dark places.
<br /><br />And with their HDR, they can get the effect of having certain areas on a texture brighten/bloom more than others.  It looks awkward in places where the blooming area is abruptly cut off in shadowed areas, but it still pulls of the effect of a specular map fairly well because it changes it's brightness as you move.

<br /><br />Here you can see no specular effect on the hands or the gun.  On the edges of the gun, there's some gray areas where the paint is worn away that are baked in the diffuse map but don't react to lighting conditions like a specular mapped gun would.

<br /><br />In Cg you can fake *reflections* with specular maps. The pure *Specularity* thing that even DooM3 has is a way to obtain highlights without the need to calculate reflections (too slow to calculate in realtime)...
<br /><br /><br />There are pro and cons with those tecniques: normal specularity calculation looks cool since is dynamic, but with environmental mapping you obviously obtain cool details that the first method can't example: the blue of the sky in a outdoor scene.

<br /><br />True, in real life specularity is the result of reflections from the environment. In that sense, specularity is fake. It is not a real physical property.
<br /><br />However, the reflection simulated by specular maps is supposed to represent the distorted reflections caused by mircoscopic surface bumps.
<br /><br />As you know, not all surfaces are as smooth as glass so in cases where reflections shouldn't be mirror-like, and performance is an issue (as in the case of real-time rendering), specularity is suitable.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p139801" date="Posted: Wed Apr 12, 2006 3:59 pm "><author>Black Dog</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">The problem of over-crisp reflections are easy to solve with filtered cubemaps and decent normalmaps and reflection masks.

Specular light is simply reflected light.<br /><br />I think cubemaps look much better than clunky old Blinn shading in many circumstances, while not being dynamic. The pop between two cubemaps is a bit jarring though.</div>
<br /><br />In Cg you can fake *reflections* with specular maps. The pure *Specularity* thing that even DooM3 has is a way to obtain highlights without the need to calculate reflections (too slow to calculate in realtime)...
<br /><br /><br />There are pro and cons with those tecniques: normal specularity calculation looks cool since is dynamic, but with environmental mapping you obviously obtain cool details that the first method can't example: the blue of the sky in a outdoor scene. If the floor is reflective, you must see a blue tint of the sky in theory...</div>]]></body></post><post id="p139784" date="Posted: Wed Apr 12, 2006 10:35 am "><author>rich_is_bored</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">There's a place for specularity in the scheme of things as reflections aren't always crystal clear. Pure reflections on everything would result in complaints like "everything looks like chrome".
<br /><br />True, in real life specularity is the result of reflections from the environment. In that sense, specularity is fake. It is not a real physical property.
<br /><br />However, the reflection simulated by specular maps is supposed to represent the distorted reflections caused by mircoscopic surface bumps.
<br /><br />As you know, not all surfaces are as smooth as glass so in cases where reflections shouldn't be mirror-like, and performance is an issue (as in the case of real-time rendering), specularity is suitable.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p139801" date="Posted: Wed Apr 12, 2006 3:59 pm "><author>Black Dog</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">The problem of over-crisp reflections are easy to solve with filtered cubemaps and decent normalmaps and reflection masks.

<br /><br />I bet if you took a look at the SDK you could probably hack "proper" specularity into Source since it already supports the alpha channel for the cubemapped surfaces. I don't know why you'd want to since the way it works already looks excellent.</div>]]></body></post></posts></thread></xml>
