<br />No idea, it depends on what the issue is.
<br /><br />What happens? What error messages do you get? What is on the console? What does your mod change, and how is it packaged? What versions of things are you using?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p180134" date="Posted: Thu Jun 07, 2007 4:39 pm "><author>GrimzBlood</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Guess the best way to descrbie it is that the game loads up when we create the server but other players cant find the game...

<br /><br />Are you running the server with si_pure 0? If so, dont.
<br /><br />Are you sure you have the same pk4s? This includes all maps that are on the server.
<br /><br />You could always enable downloads (net_serverDlTable "*", and net_serverDownload 3), then it'll dl any pk4's that are missing, unless they're named pak*.pk4</div>]]></body></post><post id="p180148" date="Posted: Thu Jun 07, 2007 6:19 pm "><author>GrimzBlood</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">i just set up the games after directly takeing the pk4s off the other computer.
