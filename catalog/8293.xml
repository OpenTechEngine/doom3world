<br /><br />Here's a quick shot of some of the work I've been doing on the roads... I've done a lot more, but that'll be seen in the upcoming test-build...
<br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121122544im_/http://dev.rosebrough.com/d3/euro/roadtest/road01.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />A quick note: the street lamps and the "no entry" sign are temporary/WIP.  
<br /><br />Here's how I'm doing the roads, in case folks need to know for their own planning or whatever....
<br /><br />The road is one texture.  Period.  I'm using Dante_uk's road... I haven't altered it at all.
<br /><br />Then, for all of the lines and markings on the road, I'm using the typical id decal... with one modification so that the textures aren't "fullbright," which is that I'm doing a "blend diffuse" instead of a "blend add" in the appropriate shader stage.  This means that all of the cracks and bumps in the road normalmap itself are not lost, there's no brain-teasing effort to line up textures and have them look nice around bends, etc.  It's all very simple patchmesh work... and one final plus is that the textures I'm using for the road are all 128x128 or less, and most of them are just stretched and repeated to give the proper effect.  This means, of course, that the road detail is taking up very little texture memory outside of the "road" texture itself.  
<br /><br />Also, I've researched some of the various London traffic markings and have created decals for most of them... "no clogging," red zones, zebra crossings, toucan crossings, those thin double-yellow lines that sometimes are seen along the curbs, etc.  Again, since everything is made of patches, it's really easy to line everything up and never lose texture quality or alignment.  
<br /><br />Let me know what you think.

<br /><br />I'm not sure you markings are quite right:

<br /><br />I also don't think it really matters.
<br /><br />I really looking forward to the next test build.
<br /><br />PS: I've updated my block3 thread with a link to new screens + I've uploaded to my site a pk4 of all my textures+prefab. I'm at work at the moment so I don't have access to your site from here. I made the first attempt at replacing all my cylinders on the balcony with a simple brush with an alpha channel texture. I looks okay but needs a little more work at some point. I only had an hour or two this morning before the boss got in <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121122544im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p72048" date="Posted: Fri Jan 14, 2005 4:11 pm "><author>goliathvt</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">AAHHHH FINALLY... I've been looking for that exact type of site off and on for like a week.  It's a shame it doesn't show up on the first page when you search for things like "london traffic marking", "london road marking", etc.  I don't think I ever tried "code" though.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121122544im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" /><br /><br />Thanks!
<br /><br />I'll make some new decals and figure out some sort of traffic pattern and add the correct markings.  It's so easy to change things around the way I've put 'em together so it's no biggie.
<br /><br />I'll grab your latest prefab/assets later on today.  I'm still waiting on other folks to upload their stuff or at least contact me.

Apart from that, they're looking nice. With the junction you have there in that shot, the markings would look more like:

<br /><br />These are unimportant though, I can't wait to see the finished product. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121122544im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p72383" date="Posted: Sun Jan 16, 2005 4:48 pm "><author>Dante_uk</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Something that is missing from the square is pigeons.

<br /><br /><br />maybe goliath should look into this later in the proyect (he has enough work right now) ...he knows how to script quite well, and by the looks of it, the BASIC monster AI script should work nice. It should be changed so that the 'monster' (pigeon) escapes the player, rather than chase him. and as a basic thing, the pigeon could be 'static' and just slide through the floor..then someone could animate it..?
<br /><br />Unfortunately, i dont have enough knowledge on how the syntaxs goes, or programming in C++ as to do this myself..  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121122544im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_cry.gif" alt=":cry:" title="Crying or Very sad" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p72583" date="Posted: Tue Jan 18, 2005 12:22 am "><author>parsonsbear</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Craig Reynold's 'boids' flocking algorithm would be pretty easy to implement

<br />i started these some time ago when d3 can do it too project was in its very ealry stages and got side tracked into doing several other things.
<br /><br />Maybe its time to pick these back up. there not animated properly just move foward about 32 and the whole body tilts for the pecking but it was a enough for testing. The scripting at the moment was very early test stuff and all they did was wait for you to come into site then make 3 choices stand still , move towards you or peck at the ground. (was a whole lot more planned)
<br />Still need AF's and animating properly and theres a slight problem with the uv's.

<br /><br /><br />maybe goliath should look into this later in the proyect (he has enough work right now) ...he knows how to script quite well, and by the looks of it, the BASIC monster AI script should work nice. It should be changed so that the 'monster' (pigeon) escapes the player, rather than chase him. and as a basic thing, the pigeon could be 'static' and just slide through the floor..then someone could animate it..?

<br />i started these some time ago when d3 can do it too project was in its very ealry stages and got side tracked into doing several other things.
<br /><br />Maybe its time to pick these back up. there not animated properly just move foward about 32 and the whole body tilts for the pecking but it was a enough for testing. The scripting at the moment was very early test stuff and all they did was wait for you to come into site then make 3 choices stand still , move towards you or peck at the ground. (was a whole lot more planned)
<br />Still need AF's and animating properly and theres a slight problem with the uv's.

<br /><br />Here's a quick shot of some of the work I've been doing on the roads... I've done a lot more, but that'll be seen in the upcoming test-build...
<br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121123802im_/http://dev.rosebrough.com/d3/euro/roadtest/road01.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />A quick note: the street lamps and the "no entry" sign are temporary/WIP.  
<br /><br />Here's how I'm doing the roads, in case folks need to know for their own planning or whatever....
<br /><br />The road is one texture.  Period.  I'm using Dante_uk's road... I haven't altered it at all.
<br /><br />Then, for all of the lines and markings on the road, I'm using the typical id decal... with one modification so that the textures aren't "fullbright," which is that I'm doing a "blend diffuse" instead of a "blend add" in the appropriate shader stage.  This means that all of the cracks and bumps in the road normalmap itself are not lost, there's no brain-teasing effort to line up textures and have them look nice around bends, etc.  It's all very simple patchmesh work... and one final plus is that the textures I'm using for the road are all 128x128 or less, and most of them are just stretched and repeated to give the proper effect.  This means, of course, that the road detail is taking up very little texture memory outside of the "road" texture itself.  
<br /><br />Also, I've researched some of the various London traffic markings and have created decals for most of them... "no clogging," red zones, zebra crossings, toucan crossings, those thin double-yellow lines that sometimes are seen along the curbs, etc.  Again, since everything is made of patches, it's really easy to line everything up and never lose texture quality or alignment.  
<br /><br />Let me know what you think.

<br /><br />These are unimportant though, I can't wait to see the finished product. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121123802im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p72383" date="Posted: Sun Jan 16, 2005 4:48 pm "><author>Dante_uk</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Something that is missing from the square is pigeons.
<br />Someone should model a pigeon(2/3 skins) with basic animations, they don't do much jsut wonder around pecking at the ground.
<br /><br />I basic hop and short flight animation for when they get startled.
<br /><br />Obviously they'd require some basic AI but I'm willing to look at that.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p72386" date="Posted: Sun Jan 16, 2005 5:07 pm "><author>Mordenkainen</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Dante_uk wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Something that is missing from the square is pigeons.<br /></div>

<br /><br /><br />maybe goliath should look into this later in the proyect (he has enough work right now) ...he knows how to script quite well, and by the looks of it, the BASIC monster AI script should work nice. It should be changed so that the 'monster' (pigeon) escapes the player, rather than chase him. and as a basic thing, the pigeon could be 'static' and just slide through the floor..then someone could animate it..?
<br /><br />Unfortunately, i dont have enough knowledge on how the syntaxs goes, or programming in C++ as to do this myself..  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121123802im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_cry.gif" alt=":cry:" title="Crying or Very sad" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p72583" date="Posted: Tue Jan 18, 2005 12:22 am "><author>parsonsbear</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Craig Reynold's 'boids' flocking algorithm would be pretty easy to implement

<br />i started these some time ago when d3 can do it too project was in its very ealry stages and got side tracked into doing several other things.
<br /><br />Maybe its time to pick these back up. there not animated properly just move foward about 32 and the whole body tilts for the pecking but it was a enough for testing. The scripting at the moment was very early test stuff and all they did was wait for you to come into site then make 3 choices stand still , move towards you or peck at the ground. (was a whole lot more planned)
<br />Still need AF's and animating properly and theres a slight problem with the uv's.
