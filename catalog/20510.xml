I mean we know what they do in the context of the game but what effect are they supposed to represent in the real world?<br /><br />I'm guessing it's supposed to be light that doesn't have a defined source or direction. It's supposed to be a cheap alternative to ambient occlusion.<br /><br />And if that's the case, I don't know how anyone would go about fixing the problem short of implementing some kind of real-time ambient occlusion. I'm not even sure that's possible without access to the full source code.<br /><br />I imagine adding falloff wouldn't do anything other than dull the relief of surfaces closer to the center of an ambient light.

For us, this simulates the worlds global illumination...diffuse reflection...or whatever you wish to call it.  Shadows without a very small amount of ambient are unnaturally pitch black in doom 3, as I'm sure you know.<br /><br />In any case, the no falloff ambient incorrectly lights the bump map...making it look like it's lit from an angle..instead of flat.
