<br />(the MayaImportx86.dll only works with maya7)
<br /><br />so, i am thinking about writing a MD5-exporter in MEL.
<br />how hard can that be? and is it even possible? has anyone already tried something like that?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p160727" date="Posted: Thu Oct 26, 2006 8:08 pm "><author>der_ton</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">If MEL scripts have access to a mesh, its UVs and skin information and to the skeleton and its animation (I assume they do), and if MEL scripts can write data into files, and if you can do math in MEL scripts, then it is definitely possible. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p160729" date="Posted: Thu Oct 26, 2006 8:13 pm "><author>ehmdjii</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">thanks for the info.

<br /><br />The entire interface, for the most part, of maya is written in mel. So having access to the model's verts and normals is very possible as is any uv and bone information. Mel can do most logical math functions(even sin/cos) and can write files.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p178147" date="Posted: Mon May 14, 2007 5:31 pm "><author>kensvehla</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I had found this plugin for Maya for MD5's although while running the plugin it gives me a shader error which  I'm assuming is my own fault, but other than that it seems to work just fine.
