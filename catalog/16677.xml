<br /><br />Minus the slightly noticeable low-polygon terrain, this has to be the best screenshot I've seen so far. The large mountains in the background, the very soft looking trees, the distant fogging and cloudy blue skies - I'm amazed.
<br /><br />After all the times gamers insulted the Doom3Engine for the slight inability to render outside areas, this actually looks <span style="font-style: italic">far</span> better than Half-Life 2 and Far Cry. I'm really impressed so far, and now I'm really looking forward to this.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p152216" date="Posted: Fri Aug 04, 2006 8:30 am "><author>MaxiM</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Agreed!

<br /><br />the engine renders the terrain "brute force all the way to the horizon". in other words, the engine doesn't mess with terrain lod so a low poly mesh is to be expected.
<br /><br />nonetheless, it renders outdoor scenes very well. this is why someone needs to make a sp game with it!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p152269" date="Posted: Fri Aug 04, 2006 7:17 pm "><author>TelMarine</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">just watched the video presentation from quakecon, this game looks so sweet it is unbelievable.

<br /><br />I hope they create a kick ass trailer like Quake4 had before release (I believe QW deserves a trailer like that more than Quake4 did).  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081204105716im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil" /><br /><br />Oh and if you don't already know, there's new profile stuff on their site.

<br /><br />Minus the slightly noticeable low-polygon terrain, this has to be the best screenshot I've seen so far. The large mountains in the background, the very soft looking trees, the distant fogging and cloudy blue skies - I'm amazed.
<br /><br />After all the times gamers insulted the Doom3Engine for the slight inability to render outside areas, this actually looks <span style="font-style: italic">far</span> better than Half-Life 2 and Far Cry.

<br /><br />the engine renders the terrain "brute force all the way to the horizon". in other words, the engine doesn't mess with terrain lod so a low poly mesh is to be expected.

<br /><br />Out of character of what? RtCW was moving in the direction of large environments you can explore anyway, so this seems like a logical progression. In any case, of the little information released about RtCW2, they have consistently emphasized that the whole game is one single huge world instead of distinct levels, and that objectives will not be "Point A to Point B" indicating that it'll be pretty non-linear. Of course we don't know how far it'll go, but considering that's really the only thing they've said about it, it appears that's the core design step they're taking with it.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p176549" date="Posted: Mon Apr 23, 2007 7:59 pm "><author>pbmax</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">sxotty wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">Gabrobot wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">The Happy Friar wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">wonder if STALKER could be re-done in this.  <img src="/web/20081204110326im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div><br /><br />That would be awesome, although I'm hoping RTCW2 will sort of be like a better version of STALKER what with the whole non-linear thing.</div><br /><br />I would be pleased, but I doubt it.

<br /><br />Both of you surely know that Raven is wholly owned by Activision, right? There's not much id Software can do, aside perhaps from strongarming Acti into changing its own (Raven's) practices lest they lose id as a developer to competing publishers.
<br /><br />Personally, I wasn't impressed by Q4 (though perhaps that's because I never did like the Strogg universe created with Quake 2) however I still felt it was a good game, if too short. I think the problem with Q4 was two-fold:
<br /><br />1) The DOOM3 engine. Both real limitations and ignorance in the game community buried this game from the start. Before it was released every Q4 story/screenshot that appeared in Blues, The Shack, Ve3D, etc. had comments like "looks like D3, too dark, too plastiky, too whatever". It's obvious id Software had a part to play here with their (mis)management of the engine itself or rather, properly educating people on the benefits of it. Take FEAR and RIDDICK as examples, pretty much the same type of engine and look as D3 but people still rave how FEAR looks great (and it does, if you ignore the repetitive map design, but so does D3).
<br /><br />2) The game felt unfocused. It was single player and multiplayer, MP was a copy of Q3, single player didn't really offer anything new with the exception of a few scenes. Change the name and it becomes just another shoot-'em-up game. The same can't be said of DOOM 3. This is undoubtedly subjective though.
<br /><br />It also didn't help that Q4 was the lemon in the XBOX 360's first batch of games, which gave the game a terrible reputation which I believe spilt onto the PC version. Even though it was released a year and some months after D3, there were precious little advances in engine technology, yes we got better ambient lighting but D3 used so little of the original there's no chance to compare the two. Q4 also cut some D3 features like MP IK, shadow casting torch (unless you play in Ultra) and per poly hit detection (for MP). In many ways Q4 is a step down from D3.
<br /><br />I also question id's decision to bow down to the H4RDC0R3!!!11!!(one)!! crowd with providing bright skins and forceambient lighting, etc. Before all of those you could actually see Quake 4 on Gamespy's MP stat page. Now you don't. Q4 is beaten by Q2 in this case. I know I stopped playing Q4 mp a while ago. It's also frustrating that id is taking so long to release final patches for Q4. I got a map ready to go just waiting for the newest patch to go final to see if they finally fixed ladders in MP.
<br /><br />So anyway, I think my point is that the Raven guys probably have less responsability on the game's outcome than you guys are saying. The textures were top notch, the audio was great, nice motion capture, diverse maps, etc. ie what Raven as a developer could do I think they delivered; it's the rest that was either poorly planned or the victim of some bad management decisions. IMO, both Activision and id had final say on both the logistics and game direction respectively, which is what doomed the game.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p176603" date="Posted: Tue Apr 24, 2007 4:02 am "><author>Gabrobot</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Mordenkainen wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Both of you surely know that Raven is wholly owned by Activision, right?

<br /><br />Yeah I know...I'd actually say that's the main reason for Raven's slipping. I've seen it happening over time. As a fan of the original Jedi Knight I followed the development of Jedi Knight II with great anticipation. I personally think it turned out great and Raven did some great work on it. Jedi Academy on the other hand, while good as an expansion type game, was starting to show the side effects of Raven's corporate development practices. Jedi Outcast had a reasonably sized team, whereas for Jedi Academy they went in favor of hiring a shit load of people and it showed. The game had tons of new content and the modding abilities were greatly enhanced, but it just felt kinda soulless.
<br /><br />I don't think you can discount id Software's power over the development of games they're overseeing. id Software is still very much independent of Activision...for example Carmack's cell phone games are published by EA. I also recall Carmack mentioning a while back that they hadn't started showing their new game around to different publishers yet indicating that they weren't set on having Activision publish the game. I'm sure Activision doesn't want to lose a lucrative deal with id Software. In that context it seems like giving id Software the power to closely control Raven's development process on id Software games seems pretty reasonable.
<br /><br />In any case, I forgot to mention that I have reason to believe based on some of the people Raven hired late in and after Quake 4's development that they've changed tack. One of them is an old school mapper who can do all aspects of mapping instead of only doing part of it (I think that having too many people working on the same map stiffles creativity), and the other is known for his innovative use of the Quake 3 engine and Q3map2 to do natural environments. So I'm hoping that Raven is taking some much needed steps back as far as their development process goes and is focusing on a smaller but more skilled dev team for RtCW2.
<br /><br />Oh, and I do think id Software is certainly responsible to some extent for not overseeing Quake 4 better...I get the impression Quake Wars is being handled somewhat differently, with id Software taking a more hands on role (such as developing some of the major technology like the bot AI). Quake 4 felt very much like Raven was left to do their own thing with the engine, and they just went for the quick and easy solutions that they already knew how to do (for example tearing out much of the scripting stuff and hard coding it instead). And I know for a fact that this <span style="font-style: italic">is</span> the sort of thing they do...they admitted to doing it in Jedi Outcast. Much of the increased mod support in Jedi Academy was simply them going back and changing their rushed hard coded stuff into more versatile script systems.
<br /><br />EDIT: Oh, and I do have to praise Raven on the AI system in Quake 4. I was sure before hand that they were just going to take their waypoint system from their earlier games and stick it in the Doom 3 engine and completely tear out the AAS stuff. I was very much surprised at how much work they put into the AI system and that they integrated into Doom 3's existing system...it's uber easy to work with, especially compared with the pain-in-the-ass system they used in their Quake 3 engine games. It's just a pity they didn't actually really use it in Quake 4. Thankfully it looks like it's getting a second chance with RtCW2. <img src="/web/20081204110326im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p178597" date="Posted: Sun May 20, 2007 7:50 am "><author>abbaon</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><a href="/web/20081204110326/http://www.gamershell.com/news/38602.html" class="postlink">http://www.gamershell.com/news/38602.html</a>

<br /><br />No, look...I took pics from the high res trailer and compared them with the new screens scaled down to the same size...there's no doubt it's more detailed, even taking into account compression in the video.

<br /><br /><br />Since  Stalker is 100% realtime lighting and Quake wars got prebaked stuff, I can't see the point.
<br /><br />To be honest, I really can't see a thing in QW that looks better than Stalker ... <img src="/web/20081204104551im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p176385" date="Posted: Sat Apr 21, 2007 11:52 pm "><author>The Happy Friar</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Most of the memory usage/slowdown in Stalker comes from textures.  megatexture (according to everyone @ SD &amp; id) solved this.

<br /><br />Minus the slightly noticeable low-polygon terrain, this has to be the best screenshot I've seen so far. The large mountains in the background, the very soft looking trees, the distant fogging and cloudy blue skies - I'm amazed.

<br /><br />the engine renders the terrain "brute force all the way to the horizon". in other words, the engine doesn't mess with terrain lod so a low poly mesh is to be expected.

<br /><br />Out of character of what? RtCW was moving in the direction of large environments you can explore anyway, so this seems like a logical progression. In any case, of the little information released about RtCW2, they have consistently emphasized that the whole game is one single huge world instead of distinct levels, and that objectives will not be "Point A to Point B" indicating that it'll be pretty non-linear. Of course we don't know how far it'll go, but considering that's really the only thing they've said about it, it appears that's the core design step they're taking with it.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p176549" date="Posted: Mon Apr 23, 2007 7:59 pm "><author>pbmax</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">sxotty wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">Gabrobot wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">The Happy Friar wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">wonder if STALKER could be re-done in this.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081204110326im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div><br /><br />That would be awesome, although I'm hoping RTCW2 will sort of be like a better version of STALKER what with the whole non-linear thing.</div><br /><br />I would be pleased, but I doubt it.

<br /><br />Both of you surely know that Raven is wholly owned by Activision, right? There's not much id Software can do, aside perhaps from strongarming Acti into changing its own (Raven's) practices lest they lose id as a developer to competing publishers.
<br /><br />Personally, I wasn't impressed by Q4 (though perhaps that's because I never did like the Strogg universe created with Quake 2) however I still felt it was a good game, if too short. I think the problem with Q4 was two-fold:
<br /><br />1) The DOOM3 engine. Both real limitations and ignorance in the game community buried this game from the start. Before it was released every Q4 story/screenshot that appeared in Blues, The Shack, Ve3D, etc. had comments like "looks like D3, too dark, too plastiky, too whatever". It's obvious id Software had a part to play here with their (mis)management of the engine itself or rather, properly educating people on the benefits of it. Take FEAR and RIDDICK as examples, pretty much the same type of engine and look as D3 but people still rave how FEAR looks great (and it does, if you ignore the repetitive map design, but so does D3).
<br /><br />2) The game felt unfocused. It was single player and multiplayer, MP was a copy of Q3, single player didn't really offer anything new with the exception of a few scenes. Change the name and it becomes just another shoot-'em-up game. The same can't be said of DOOM 3. This is undoubtedly subjective though.
<br /><br />It also didn't help that Q4 was the lemon in the XBOX 360's first batch of games, which gave the game a terrible reputation which I believe spilt onto the PC version. Even though it was released a year and some months after D3, there were precious little advances in engine technology, yes we got better ambient lighting but D3 used so little of the original there's no chance to compare the two. Q4 also cut some D3 features like MP IK, shadow casting torch (unless you play in Ultra) and per poly hit detection (for MP). In many ways Q4 is a step down from D3.
<br /><br />I also question id's decision to bow down to the H4RDC0R3!!!11!!(one)!! crowd with providing bright skins and forceambient lighting, etc. Before all of those you could actually see Quake 4 on Gamespy's MP stat page. Now you don't. Q4 is beaten by Q2 in this case. I know I stopped playing Q4 mp a while ago. It's also frustrating that id is taking so long to release final patches for Q4. I got a map ready to go just waiting for the newest patch to go final to see if they finally fixed ladders in MP.
<br /><br />So anyway, I think my point is that the Raven guys probably have less responsability on the game's outcome than you guys are saying. The textures were top notch, the audio was great, nice motion capture, diverse maps, etc. ie what Raven as a developer could do I think they delivered; it's the rest that was either poorly planned or the victim of some bad management decisions. IMO, both Activision and id had final say on both the logistics and game direction respectively, which is what doomed the game.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p176603" date="Posted: Tue Apr 24, 2007 4:02 am "><author>Gabrobot</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Mordenkainen wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Both of you surely know that Raven is wholly owned by Activision, right?

<br /><br />Yeah I know...I'd actually say that's the main reason for Raven's slipping. I've seen it happening over time. As a fan of the original Jedi Knight I followed the development of Jedi Knight II with great anticipation. I personally think it turned out great and Raven did some great work on it. Jedi Academy on the other hand, while good as an expansion type game, was starting to show the side effects of Raven's corporate development practices. Jedi Outcast had a reasonably sized team, whereas for Jedi Academy they went in favor of hiring a shit load of people and it showed. The game had tons of new content and the modding abilities were greatly enhanced, but it just felt kinda soulless.
<br /><br />I don't think you can discount id Software's power over the development of games they're overseeing. id Software is still very much independent of Activision...for example Carmack's cell phone games are published by EA. I also recall Carmack mentioning a while back that they hadn't started showing their new game around to different publishers yet indicating that they weren't set on having Activision publish the game. I'm sure Activision doesn't want to lose a lucrative deal with id Software. In that context it seems like giving id Software the power to closely control Raven's development process on id Software games seems pretty reasonable.
<br /><br />In any case, I forgot to mention that I have reason to believe based on some of the people Raven hired late in and after Quake 4's development that they've changed tack. One of them is an old school mapper who can do all aspects of mapping instead of only doing part of it (I think that having too many people working on the same map stiffles creativity), and the other is known for his innovative use of the Quake 3 engine and Q3map2 to do natural environments. So I'm hoping that Raven is taking some much needed steps back as far as their development process goes and is focusing on a smaller but more skilled dev team for RtCW2.
<br /><br />Oh, and I do think id Software is certainly responsible to some extent for not overseeing Quake 4 better...I get the impression Quake Wars is being handled somewhat differently, with id Software taking a more hands on role (such as developing some of the major technology like the bot AI). Quake 4 felt very much like Raven was left to do their own thing with the engine, and they just went for the quick and easy solutions that they already knew how to do (for example tearing out much of the scripting stuff and hard coding it instead). And I know for a fact that this <span style="font-style: italic">is</span> the sort of thing they do...they admitted to doing it in Jedi Outcast. Much of the increased mod support in Jedi Academy was simply them going back and changing their rushed hard coded stuff into more versatile script systems.
<br /><br />EDIT: Oh, and I do have to praise Raven on the AI system in Quake 4. I was sure before hand that they were just going to take their waypoint system from their earlier games and stick it in the Doom 3 engine and completely tear out the AAS stuff. I was very much surprised at how much work they put into the AI system and that they integrated into Doom 3's existing system...it's uber easy to work with, especially compared with the pain-in-the-ass system they used in their Quake 3 engine games. It's just a pity they didn't actually really use it in Quake 4. Thankfully it looks like it's getting a second chance with RtCW2. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081204110326im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p178597" date="Posted: Sun May 20, 2007 7:50 am "><author>abbaon</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081204110326/http://www.gamershell.com/news/38602.html" class="postlink">http://www.gamershell.com/news/38602.html</a>

<br /><br />Minus the slightly noticeable low-polygon terrain, this has to be the best screenshot I've seen so far. The large mountains in the background, the very soft looking trees, the distant fogging and cloudy blue skies - I'm amazed.

<br /><br />the engine renders the terrain "brute force all the way to the horizon". in other words, the engine doesn't mess with terrain lod so a low poly mesh is to be expected.

<br /><br />Out of character of what? RtCW was moving in the direction of large environments you can explore anyway, so this seems like a logical progression. In any case, of the little information released about RtCW2, they have consistently emphasized that the whole game is one single huge world instead of distinct levels, and that objectives will not be "Point A to Point B" indicating that it'll be pretty non-linear. Of course we don't know how far it'll go, but considering that's really the only thing they've said about it, it appears that's the core design step they're taking with it.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p176549" date="Posted: Mon Apr 23, 2007 7:59 pm "><author>pbmax</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">sxotty wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">Gabrobot wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">The Happy Friar wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">wonder if STALKER could be re-done in this.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081204110326im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div><br /><br />That would be awesome, although I'm hoping RTCW2 will sort of be like a better version of STALKER what with the whole non-linear thing.</div><br /><br />I would be pleased, but I doubt it.

<br /><br />Sadly that's true...I'm hoping for the best, but to be honest I won't really get excited until I see something. I recall Todd Hollenshead making a comment about Quake 4 having extremely disappointing sales figures, and that they were taking definite steps to prevent things like that from happening in the future.

I recall Todd Hollenshead making a comment about Quake 4 having extremely disappointing sales figures, and that they were taking definite steps to prevent things like that from happening in the future. So hopefully id's influence will turn Raven's development practices around and get them away from the corporate process they currently employ.</div>
<br /><br />Both of you surely know that Raven is wholly owned by Activision, right? There's not much id Software can do, aside perhaps from strongarming Acti into changing its own (Raven's) practices lest they lose id as a developer to competing publishers.
<br /><br />Personally, I wasn't impressed by Q4 (though perhaps that's because I never did like the Strogg universe created with Quake 2) however I still felt it was a good game, if too short. I think the problem with Q4 was two-fold:
<br /><br />1) The DOOM3 engine. Both real limitations and ignorance in the game community buried this game from the start. Before it was released every Q4 story/screenshot that appeared in Blues, The Shack, Ve3D, etc. had comments like "looks like D3, too dark, too plastiky, too whatever". It's obvious id Software had a part to play here with their (mis)management of the engine itself or rather, properly educating people on the benefits of it. Take FEAR and RIDDICK as examples, pretty much the same type of engine and look as D3 but people still rave how FEAR looks great (and it does, if you ignore the repetitive map design, but so does D3).
<br /><br />2) The game felt unfocused. It was single player and multiplayer, MP was a copy of Q3, single player didn't really offer anything new with the exception of a few scenes. Change the name and it becomes just another shoot-'em-up game. The same can't be said of DOOM 3. This is undoubtedly subjective though.
<br /><br />It also didn't help that Q4 was the lemon in the XBOX 360's first batch of games, which gave the game a terrible reputation which I believe spilt onto the PC version. Even though it was released a year and some months after D3, there were precious little advances in engine technology, yes we got better ambient lighting but D3 used so little of the original there's no chance to compare the two. Q4 also cut some D3 features like MP IK, shadow casting torch (unless you play in Ultra) and per poly hit detection (for MP). In many ways Q4 is a step down from D3.
<br /><br />I also question id's decision to bow down to the H4RDC0R3!!!11!!(one)!! crowd with providing bright skins and forceambient lighting, etc. Before all of those you could actually see Quake 4 on Gamespy's MP stat page. Now you don't. Q4 is beaten by Q2 in this case. I know I stopped playing Q4 mp a while ago. It's also frustrating that id is taking so long to release final patches for Q4. I got a map ready to go just waiting for the newest patch to go final to see if they finally fixed ladders in MP.
<br /><br />So anyway, I think my point is that the Raven guys probably have less responsability on the game's outcome than you guys are saying. The textures were top notch, the audio was great, nice motion capture, diverse maps, etc. ie what Raven as a developer could do I think they delivered; it's the rest that was either poorly planned or the victim of some bad management decisions. IMO, both Activision and id had final say on both the logistics and game direction respectively, which is what doomed the game.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p176603" date="Posted: Tue Apr 24, 2007 4:02 am "><author>Gabrobot</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Mordenkainen wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Both of you surely know that Raven is wholly owned by Activision, right?

<br /><br />Yeah I know...I'd actually say that's the main reason for Raven's slipping. I've seen it happening over time. As a fan of the original Jedi Knight I followed the development of Jedi Knight II with great anticipation. I personally think it turned out great and Raven did some great work on it. Jedi Academy on the other hand, while good as an expansion type game, was starting to show the side effects of Raven's corporate development practices. Jedi Outcast had a reasonably sized team, whereas for Jedi Academy they went in favor of hiring a shit load of people and it showed. The game had tons of new content and the modding abilities were greatly enhanced, but it just felt kinda soulless.
<br /><br />I don't think you can discount id Software's power over the development of games they're overseeing. id Software is still very much independent of Activision...for example Carmack's cell phone games are published by EA. I also recall Carmack mentioning a while back that they hadn't started showing their new game around to different publishers yet indicating that they weren't set on having Activision publish the game. I'm sure Activision doesn't want to lose a lucrative deal with id Software. In that context it seems like giving id Software the power to closely control Raven's development process on id Software games seems pretty reasonable.
<br /><br />In any case, I forgot to mention that I have reason to believe based on some of the people Raven hired late in and after Quake 4's development that they've changed tack. One of them is an old school mapper who can do all aspects of mapping instead of only doing part of it (I think that having too many people working on the same map stiffles creativity), and the other is known for his innovative use of the Quake 3 engine and Q3map2 to do natural environments. So I'm hoping that Raven is taking some much needed steps back as far as their development process goes and is focusing on a smaller but more skilled dev team for RtCW2.
<br /><br />Oh, and I do think id Software is certainly responsible to some extent for not overseeing Quake 4 better...I get the impression Quake Wars is being handled somewhat differently, with id Software taking a more hands on role (such as developing some of the major technology like the bot AI). Quake 4 felt very much like Raven was left to do their own thing with the engine, and they just went for the quick and easy solutions that they already knew how to do (for example tearing out much of the scripting stuff and hard coding it instead). And I know for a fact that this <span style="font-style: italic">is</span> the sort of thing they do...they admitted to doing it in Jedi Outcast. Much of the increased mod support in Jedi Academy was simply them going back and changing their rushed hard coded stuff into more versatile script systems.
<br /><br />EDIT: Oh, and I do have to praise Raven on the AI system in Quake 4. I was sure before hand that they were just going to take their waypoint system from their earlier games and stick it in the Doom 3 engine and completely tear out the AAS stuff. I was very much surprised at how much work they put into the AI system and that they integrated into Doom 3's existing system...it's uber easy to work with, especially compared with the pain-in-the-ass system they used in their Quake 3 engine games. It's just a pity they didn't actually really use it in Quake 4. Thankfully it looks like it's getting a second chance with RtCW2. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081204110326im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p178597" date="Posted: Sun May 20, 2007 7:50 am "><author>abbaon</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081204110326/http://www.gamershell.com/news/38602.html" class="postlink">http://www.gamershell.com/news/38602.html</a>

<br /><br />It's more than just settings...look at the last two images in my post...the road isn't just more detailed, the lines painted on it are completely different.
