<br /> So if you're rendering them with fprime in layout, just remember to delete the shader before you save it for doom.
<br /> Damn that was giving me a headache for hours until  discovered that :/</div>]]></body></post><post id="p83809" date="Posted: Tue Mar 22, 2005 7:43 pm "><author>Rayne</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Hi oD,
<br /><br />can you explain this thing better? Sounds strange!  How will Fprime mess your model if its purpose is to "render the scene"?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p83826" date="Posted: Tue Mar 22, 2005 9:27 pm "><author>rich_is_bored</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Hmmm. Interesting find.
<br /><br />The way FPrime works is it adds a shader to your objects...

Apparently Doom 3 doesn't like shaders.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p83837" date="Posted: Tue Mar 22, 2005 10:06 pm "><author>oDDity</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I haven't tried all shaders, but I know that you can have the surface baker shader for example, with no problems. Maybe there are others as well, but fprime is definitely not wanted by doom. It obviously adds something unexpected to the lwo file which doom can't read.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p87310" date="Posted: Sat Apr 09, 2005 11:30 pm "><author>bytehawk</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">this is no longer the case in lw8.2 and fprime 1.5
