Hey proton - very happy welcome here!&#13;
<br/><br/>
I hope you'll keep us updated on interesting news!&#13;

Other than that - the new LW[8] looks like it's going to rock.&#13;

I really appreciate all the work you put into gathering tutorials, releasing free models, rigs, scenes and countless things more.&#13;

Hey proton - very happy welcome here!&#13;
<br/><br/>
I hope you'll keep us updated on interesting news!&#13;
<br/><br/>
Other than that - the new LW[8] looks like it's going to rock.&#13;
<br/><br/>
edit:&#13;
<br/><br/>
Forgot to say thanks for your ongoing community support.&#13;
<br/>
I really appreciate all the work you put into gathering tutorials, releasing free models, rigs, scenes and countless things more.&#13;

Keep your good work up William!<br/>_________________<br/><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/" target="_blank" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/site/img/d3w.gif" border="0"/> Staff - The world is yours</a>, soon in 6 degrees of freedom!&#13;
