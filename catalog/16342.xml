<br /><br />How did you make this?  I noticed the low poly has nice even quads, which makes it nicely subdivide in Zbrush.  So did you make the low poly in Max, and then generate a normal map in Zbrush?
<br /><br />Thats the way I have been doing things, but what I would like to do is get the high poly from Zbrush into Max, and that would mean I could make a better low poly model that is not dependant on nice even quads, and then render to texture, but Max cant handle the high poly in my experiance?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p148871" date="Posted: Fri Jul 07, 2006 4:41 pm "><author>obihb</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks!.
<br /><br />The model is quaded because no real room or need for optimising it. It's so simple to start with I left it like that.
<br /><br />The one I use for ZB however has more subdivisions to start with so that the polys are more square in shape and not rectangular. That helps alot in ZB. The initial model is made in Max and then exported to ZB.
<br /><br />The way I render the normal map is not from ZB. I render them from Max. The model exported from ZB is really high poly so what I do is export in pieces and render the normal map in pieces and combine them inside PS.
<br /><br />Because my UV is mirrored down the middle when I export from ZB, I only export half the mesh, but go over the middle seam a bit so those faces can get smoothed properly still. So then that also helps to keep the polygons lower than it would be by exporting the full thing.
<br /><br />I think if you wanted to bring the ZB model into Max to make your low poly model from, then just bring in a lower subdevided version. You don't need it to have such a high detail level for that purpose.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p148840" date="Posted: Fri Jul 07, 2006 1:50 pm "><author>obihb</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Something new I'm working on.

<br /><br />The model is quaded because no real room or need for optimising it. It's so simple to start with I left it like that.
<br /><br />The one I use for ZB however has more subdivisions to start with so that the polys are more square in shape and not rectangular. That helps alot in ZB. The initial model is made in Max and then exported to ZB.
<br /><br />The way I render the normal map is not from ZB. I render them from Max. The model exported from ZB is really high poly so what I do is export in pieces and render the normal map in pieces and combine them inside PS.
<br /><br />Because my UV is mirrored down the middle when I export from ZB, I only export half the mesh, but go over the middle seam a bit so those faces can get smoothed properly still. So then that also helps to keep the polygons lower than it would be by exporting the full thing.
<br /><br />I think if you wanted to bring the ZB model into Max to make your low poly model from, then just bring in a lower subdevided version. You don't need it to have such a high detail level for that purpose.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p148840" date="Posted: Fri Jul 07, 2006 12:50 pm "><author>obihb</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Something new I'm working on.
