However I was wondering exactly how people on here prefer to go about doing this?&#13;
<br/><br/>
For example do you like to create a low poly model, map out the UV's, save it, then convert it to subdiv/nurbs (or even keep as polys) to add all the key details, giving you a high poly version but working from the same UV layout.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Or do you prefer to create the high poly version of a model first, map out all of the UV's, save it and then build the low poly from scratch, aligning the UV's afterwards?&#13;
<br/><br/>
The reason i ask is because while I'm pretty happy with my low poly modeling abilities, I really want to focus on getting some hi res creations done, and am struggling to find a method I'm comfortable with focusing on.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Also regarding the creation of high poly models, lets say you've got a character with screws running up his arm. You dont want to model them on the low poly version, just the high poly, but it's too dirty to try and 'extrude' these details directly from the mesh. Is it generaly better to build such things seperately and then just place them ontop of the model, or can this create a lot of problems with overlaying UV's?&#13;
<br/><br/>
Sorry if this is somewhat of a noob question, but I am somewhat of a noob when it comes to creating high poly characters with a view to normal mapping. As always, cheers in advance!</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

<br/><br/>
The problems you are talking about with a box is not because of the normal map but because of the Doom3 render engine. It's basically unavoidable accept in a very special case of using Renderbump. It's a "special" Doom3 engine thing and not because of other software creating bad normal maps.&#13;
<br/><br/>
The technology of normal maps has it's limits and therefore can't be looked at as the perfect technology to create whatever you want without any flaws whatsoever. Knowing the limits and working around them is part of using them as is anything really in realtime graphics.&#13;
<br/><br/>
As for modelling high poly models. Esentially you can use any method that gives the result you are after. One thing that you'll find is that everybody has their own way and advice to give. The fact is that whatever works, works. There are obviously more efficient ways to do various things and that you learn along the way.&#13;
<br/><br/>
For low poly stuff however there are some stuff to keep in mind to make good use of normal maps and of course it has impact on game performance. So the low poly model is very important to get right. You also only have to worry about UV mapping the low poly model, so that saves time there. It's just  a matter of poly count balance and putting the right details in the right places. Also making sure face angles are good for normal maps to work nicely. As was said before making just a box may cause problems if not handled correctly because of the sharp 90 degree edges.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Experimenting is always a good idea and that way you'll learn first hand what works and what don't work. After a while you can judge even before working on somethig what might cause problems.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="/web/20061013061008/http://home.telkomsa.net/obihb" target="_blank" class="postlink">Obi-Wan</a></span><span class="gensmall"/></td>
