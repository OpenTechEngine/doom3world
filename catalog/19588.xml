<br /><br />i think i saw a nice tree model floating around these forums a little while ago.
<br /><br />i am currently making a model-pack of foliage at the moment, but it will be a while before it is released. foliage is a bit of a funny one in the doom3 engine, so i suggest you look aroud the various threads here that other people have put up covering how to get foliage to work in game properly.
<br />bout the best i can do for you, sorry.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p179615" date="Posted: Sun Jun 03, 2007 12:57 am "><author>Mordenkainen</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I use some on my ATW2 map: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=19625">http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=19625</a><!-- m --></div>]]></body></post><post id="p179620" date="Posted: Sun Jun 03, 2007 1:08 am "><author>BlackArmsShadow</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">

<br /><br />I used that quick guide for the [ <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.katsbits.com/htm/tutorials/making_mask_tree_leaves.htm" class="postlink">Quick way to mask tree leaves</a> ] and i have the area;s that will be alpha'd black and wht as whats supposed to be drawn and the diffuse image in there.
<br /><br />and the shader doesnt work. Not sure if its the image or my shader, i've tried several gl &amp; blend funcs and they don't work right, so now im thinking i messed the image up somewhere.
<br /><br />heres the shader

<br /><br />NOTE: I was messing around trying to get it to work, so either image or mtr file may not be right now!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p180599" date="Posted: Mon Jun 11, 2007 7:11 pm "><author>Enforcer</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">*bump* - id's tech 5 isn't gonna take me over evah!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p180611" date="Posted: Mon Jun 11, 2007 7:56 pm "><author>kat</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Image looks fine from what I can see, what did you use to create it? 
<br /><br />I just had a look at the image... it's an odd size so I'd resize it to fit the usual x2 ratios 512x256 etc..
<br /><br />I'm not sure about the material file as the closest I've come to using a 'blend' is when doing decals, I can't think of a similar texture asset from the game either which you could check out and knobble code from - all of the alpha'd texture I can think of make use of bumps and 'alphatest'</div>]]></body></post><post id="p180657" date="Posted: Tue Jun 12, 2007 12:07 am "><author>Enforcer</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">The image was done in PS:CS
<br /><br />Ill try and redo the image again, and rewrite teh shader and try it, but not untill least thursday :-/ 
<br /><br />Hopefully i can get this working right, tree's are going to play a huge role in my project so i need to get to work practicing and getting ideas for trees</div>]]></body></post></posts></thread></xml>
