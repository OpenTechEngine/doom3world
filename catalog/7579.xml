<br /><br />This Tutorial assumes you already know how to make a func_mover following a Nurbs Path, It also assumes you know the basics of GUI scripting. As well as
<br />basic scripting knowledge:
<br />If you don't read these first:

<br /><br /><br />Step 1: Start with everyone's good ole favorite Cube Map. Make it a little bigger for this exercise, I'm using 1024x1024 to give our Train some elbow room.
<br /><br /><br /><br />Step 2: Now we're going to start by creating the first NURBS Path for the Train. This will be the first stop.
<br /><br />-Right-Click to Create a func_static (use the "NoDraw" texture)
<br />-then switch to the ENTITY TAB and click "CURVE", select NURBS..
<br />-Set your path up to do a Half-loop of your cube.
<br /><br />-Name the func_static "spline1"

This will be the second stop
<br /><br />-Name this func_static "spline2"
<br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100522163842im_/http://hosting.mismith7.com/beerman/Doom3/Tutorials/train_2.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><br /><br />Step 4: Now we're going to make the train itself.
<br /><br />-Create a "func_mover" with the "NoDraw" texture. Name it "train_1"
<br /><br />-Line it's Origin up perfectly with the Origin of our func_static "spline1"
<br /><br />-Now add the following to the func_mover:
<br /><br />key "model"
<br />value "models/mapobjects/loadtrans/loadtranscomp.lwo"
<br /><br />**IMPORTANT NOTE** IF YOU WANT THE TRAIN TO BE RIDEABLE, YOU MUST USE THE MODEL TAB IN THE FUNC_MOVER. If you bind a "func_static"
<br />train model to the Func_mover instead of having the model a part of the func_mpver itself the player will slide off the train when it moves like a carpet being pulled from under his feet.
<br /><br />key "solid"
<br />value "1"
<br /><br />key "gui"
<br />value "guis/A_BEER/beer_trainstart.gui" //This is a stock GUI that I tweaked to run the train
<br /><br />key "gui_parm1"
<br />value "train_start1" //uses the GUI to call the trains first movement script
<br /><br />key "gui_parm2"
<br />value "train_start2" //uses the GUI to call the trains 2nd movement script
<br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100522163842im_/http://hosting.mismith7.com/beerman/Doom3/Tutorials/train_3.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><br />Step 5: Open up Notepad/Wordpad and make a file called *urmapname*.script
<br />-add the following
<br /><br /><span style="color: red">void train_start1() <br /><br />{ <br />        $train_1.time(45); <br />        $train_1.accelTime(10); <br />        $train_1.decelTime(5); <br /><br />        $train_1.startSpline($spline1); <br /><br />} <br /><br />void train_start2() <br /><br />{ <br />        $train_1.time(45); <br />        $train_1.accelTime(10); <br />        $train_1.decelTime(5); <br /><br />        $train_1.startSpline($spline2); <br /><br />} <br /><br />void main()<br /><br />{</span>
<br />}
<br /><br />//These are the functions that will be activated by GUI parm 1/2 to activate the train
<br /><br />Step 7: Compile and Enjoy your Multi-Stop train! (make sure you place the GUI you made and the *urmapname*.script in the appropriate folders)
<br /><br /><br />Download the testmap (with the mapscript and the GUI):

(It'll run the train through multiple stops, but recquires the GUI be "unlocked" at each stop by a remote GUI panel) I think I can do that, I was stumped but I had an epiphany at work today and I think I can do it now.</div>]]></body></post></posts></thread></xml>
