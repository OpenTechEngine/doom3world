<br /><br />I had this same problem. Trying to load RoE and getting a WEAPON_NETFIRING error. 
<br /><br />The cause: Extacting all script files from base\pak000.pk4 into the base dir.
<br /><br />Why does this cause a problem? Because there is a later version of some of the scripts in base\pak006.pk4.
<br /><br />Normally, a script in pak006 takes precedence over a script of the same name in pak000. However a script thats been extracted (ie: not in a pk4 file) has the highest precedence in the base directory.
<br /><br />Of course, any files in a mod directory take precedence over those in the base directory.
<br /><br />The solution: To test if it works, open your doom 3\base directory and rename the folder script to something else, script_x will do. Load up the mod (in my case RoE) and see if the error is still there.
<br /><br />If that's fixed the problem, you change your script_x directory back to script and then extract all the script files from all of the pk4 files in the base directory. (edit: Start with pak000 and work your way up numerically. Make sure you choose to overwrite any older files with new ones..)
<br /><br />Some of the pk4's have no scripts. But pak006.pk4 definitely has some, and,  in particular: weapon_base.script, as Nivelxe suggested you must use the latest version of this file to be compatible.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p164248" date="Posted: Sun Dec 10, 2006 12:34 pm "><author>Faiakes</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks statoJay

The cause: Extacting all script files from base\pak000.pk4 into the base dir.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Why does this cause a problem? Because there is a later version of some of the scripts in base\pak006.pk4.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Normally, a script in pak006 takes precedence over a script of the same name in pak000. However a script thats been extracted (ie: not in a pk4 file) has the highest precedence in the base directory.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Of course, any files in a mod directory take precedence over those in the base directory.&#13;
<br/><br/>
The solution: To test if it works, open your doom 3\base directory and rename the folder script to something else, script_x will do. Load up the mod (in my case RoE) and see if the error is still there.&#13;
<br/><br/>
If that's fixed the problem, you change your script_x directory back to script and then extract all the script files from all of the pk4 files in the base directory. (edit: Start with pak000 and work your way up numerically. Make sure you choose to overwrite any older files with new ones..)&#13;
<br/><br/>
Some of the pk4's have no scripts. But pak006.pk4 definitely has some, and,  in particular: weapon_base.script, as Nivelxe suggested you must use the latest version of this file to be compatible.</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

I had this same problem. Trying to load RoE and getting a WEAPON_NETFIRING error. &#13;
<br/><br/>
The cause: Extacting all script files from base\pak000.pk4 into the base dir.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Why does this cause a problem? Because there is a later version of some of the scripts in base\pak006.pk4.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Normally, a script in pak006 takes precedence over a script of the same name in pak000. However a script thats been extracted (ie: not in a pk4 file) has the highest precedence in the base directory.&#13;
