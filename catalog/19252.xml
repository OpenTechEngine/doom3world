Here are a list of features and a few screenshots.  By the way, the map is currently a placeholder.  I'm currently in negotations with a high profile mapper to help with this project.  This is a very rough and very early version (I only have ~1 minute of gameplay at this point).
<br /><br />* Dragon's Lair (tm) style gameplay with a health system
<br />* Full cinematic with all custom animation
<br />* Seamless transitions between animation cycles
<br />* Around 20 minutes in length (your mileage may vary)
<br />* Full storyline (obviously)
<br />* Checkpoint system
<br />* Added gore

<br /><br />I haven't come up with a name for the mod yet.  I was thinking of Zombies' Lair in homage to Dragon's Lair.  Also, if you are curious as of what I have done in the past, check the the Classic Doom for Doom 3 cinematics or a test machinima film I did a while back entitled Episodes:  Episode 1.

Here are a list of features and a few screenshots.  By the way, the map is currently a placeholder.  I'm currently in negotations with a high profile mapper to help with this project.  This is a very rough and very early version (I only have ~1 minute of gameplay at this point).
<br /><br />* Dragon's Lair (tm) style gameplay with a health system
<br />* Full cinematic with all custom animation
<br />* Seamless transitions between animation cycles
<br />* Around 20 minutes in length (your mileage may vary)
<br />* Full storyline (obviously)
<br />* Checkpoint system
<br />* Added gore
<br /><br />WIP Screenshots:
<br /><br />Map Scripting:

<br /><br />I haven't come up with a name for the mod yet.  I was thinking of Zombies' Lair in homage to Dragon's Lair.  Also, if you are curious as of what I have done in the past, check the the Classic Doom for Doom 3 cinematics or a test machinima film I did a while back entitled Episodes:  Episode 1.

Here are a list of features and a few screenshots.  By the way, the map is currently a placeholder.  I'm currently in negotations with a high profile mapper to help with this project.  This is a very rough and very early version (I only have ~1 minute of gameplay at this point).
<br /><br />* Dragon's Lair (tm) style gameplay with a health system
<br />* Full cinematic with all custom animation
<br />* Seamless transitions between animation cycles
<br />* Around 20 minutes in length (your mileage may vary)
<br />* Full storyline (obviously)
<br />* Checkpoint system
<br />* Added gore
<br /><br />WIP Screenshots:

<br /><br />I haven't come up with a name for the mod yet.  I was thinking of Zombies' Lair in homage to Dragon's Lair.

This is a very rough and very early version (I only have ~1 minute of gameplay at this point).
<br /><br />* Dragon's Lair (tm) style gameplay with a health system
<br />* Full cinematic with all custom animation
<br />* Seamless transitions between animation cycles
<br />* Around 20 minutes in length (your mileage may vary)
<br />* Full storyline (obviously)
<br />* Checkpoint system
<br />* Added gore

This is a very rough and very early version (I only have ~1 minute of gameplay at this point).&#13;
<br/><br/>
* Dragon's Lair (tm) style gameplay with a health system&#13;
<br/>
* Full cinematic with all custom animation&#13;
<br/>
* Seamless transitions between animation cycles&#13;
<br/>
* Around 20 minutes in length (your mileage may vary)&#13;

* Full storyline (obviously)&#13;

* Checkpoint system&#13;

I haven't come up with a name for the mod yet.  I was thinking of Zombies' Lair in homage to Dragon's Lair.  Also, if you are curious as of what I have done in the past, check the the Classic Doom for Doom 3 cinematics or a test machinima film I did a while back entitled Episodes:  Episode 1.&#13;

Here are a list of features and a few screenshots.  By the way, the map is currently a placeholder.  I'm currently in negotations with a high profile mapper to help with this project.  This is a very rough and very early version (I only have ~1 minute of gameplay at this point).
<br /><br />* Dragon's Lair (tm) style gameplay with a health system
<br />* Full cinematic with all custom animation
<br />* Seamless transitions between animation cycles
<br />* Around 20 minutes in length (your mileage may vary)
<br />* Full storyline (obviously)
<br />* Checkpoint system
<br />* Added gore

Here are a list of features and a few screenshots.  By the way, the map is currently a placeholder.  I'm currently in negotations with a high profile mapper to help with this project.  This is a very rough and very early version (I only have ~1 minute of gameplay at this point).
<br /><br />* Dragon's Lair (tm) style gameplay with a health system
<br />* Full cinematic with all custom animation
<br />* Seamless transitions between animation cycles
<br />* Around 20 minutes in length (your mileage may vary)
<br />* Full storyline (obviously)
<br />* Checkpoint system
<br />* Added gore
<br /><br />WIP Screenshots:

<br /><br />I haven't come up with a name for the mod yet.  I was thinking of Zombies' Lair in homage to Dragon's Lair.
