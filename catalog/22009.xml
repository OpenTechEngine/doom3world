People who say otherwise are told they're wrong, they're just haters, they're pirates, etc.<br /><br />You could blame the Stalker dev's but are they really to blame?  DVD copy has DRM but that's it.  The disc is needed in the drive which means you need a legit disc to get it to work.  Yes, I'm sure you can get a patch to stop that, but that's no different then getting a no-steam patch, neither stop that.  Apparently, Stalker's dev's didn't think Steam was that safe, it's got more limits then the DVD version: Steam required, online activation with 5 activation limit and DRM.  Why?  Because Steam makes it so much easier to pirate, now a pirate can only install 5 times.  That means if they install, no-steam patch &amp; remove, for each patch GSC puts out they need to eat up another install.  Great idea imho: same theory as Valve had with HL2 &amp; it's addons: make patches that change how things work so you always need a new non-steam patch to have the games work.  Why?  For the same reason I said above: you could install it on 30 people's computers &amp; then install 30 no-steam patches.  Unlike handing out the disc or even downloading via bittorrent, you get it all directly from valve, fast, easy, simple.  Similar to some US states that hand out sterilized needles to druggies so they don't spread blood borne diseases.<br /><br />My DVD copy needs the disc in the drive &amp; has DRM.<br /><br />The worst thing about that thread is that the people there don't care if VALVE shoves DRM, limits, etc. on them, but when another company does to protect their own assets, they go banana-ape-poop.  Again, the only reason it would be done is because Steam doesn't stop what the DRM/install limits do.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p205311" date="Posted: Thu Sep 25, 2008 9:09 am "><author>leifhv</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I doubt Valve is to blame for the inclusion of additional DRM in some of the titles they distribute.
