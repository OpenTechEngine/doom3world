<br /><br /><br />Greeting fellow Doom haxors.  I've put together the first installment of a two part semi-exhuastive study of Doom 3 material creation.  Enjoy...
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Some housekeeping before we get started:</span>
<br /><br />First of all, we will need to download NVidia's NormalMapFilter plug-in for Photoshop.  The plug-in can be downloaded here:
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121080712/http://developer.nvidia.com/docs/IO/1176/ATT/NormalMapFilter.8bf">http://developer.nvidia.com/docs/IO/117 ... Filter.8bf</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />This file needs to be placed in Photoshop's filter plug-ins directory.  The plug-ins directory should contain other .8bf files.  More information about the NVidia filter and its uses can be found here:
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121080712/http://www.cyberloonies.com/bump-mapping.html">http://www.cyberloonies.com/bump-mapping.html</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />Create a new folder called "custom/" in "Doom_III/base/textures/".  This is where we will save our new textures for our material stages.
<br /><br />=================
<br /><br />Now for the fun stuff.  Open up Photoshop and let's draw the stages.
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">I. Draw a diffusemap texture</span>
<br /><br />This stage will serve primarily as color information for the material.  This is basically just a standard RGB texture with dimensions based on powers of 2.  The image should contain color and value information.  A simple flat brown texture would work fine, but I whipped up this seamlessly tiling example by playing around with the drawing tools.
<br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121080712im_/http://div.dyndns.org/vector/rockwall/rockwall_d.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Save your diffusemap as Doom_III/base/textures/custom/rockwall_d.tga
<br />By convention, diffusemap texture names are denoted with a "_d" suffix.
<br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121080712im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" />  Make sure to save all your material textures as Targas because the Doom3 alpha leak doesn't seem to like Jpegs.  For this tutorial, save all targas as 24-bit as we will not be making use of an alpha channel.
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">II. Render a normalmap</span>
<br /><br />A normalmap contains per-pixel dynamic lighting information. Essentially, it uses the color information for each pixel to determine the direction from which a light source would highlight the pixel.  A normalmap can be generated from an elevation map through NVidia's wonderful little NormalMapFilter Photoshop plug-in.
<br /><br />1. Create new 512x512 RGB image as the NormalMapFilter only works on images with dimensions based on powers of 2.
<br /><br />2. Select White as foreground and black as background
<br /><br />3. From the pulldown menus select: Filter -&gt; Render -&gt; Clouds
<br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121080712im_/http://div.dyndns.org/vector/rockwall/rockwall_h.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />This cloud pattern serves as an elevation map for the NormalMapFilter plug-in.  In the elevation map, white represents high spots on the texture and black represents low spots.
<br /><br />Now, if your image for some reason is not flattened, flatten it now: 
<br />Layer -&gt; Flatten Image
<br /><br />4. Now apply NVidia's normalmap filter: Filter -&gt; nvTools -&gt; NormalMapFilter
<br /><br />You may get a warning message about channel selection and alphaheight. This is not a problem. Just click on OK.
<br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121080712im_/http://div.dyndns.org/vector/rockwall/rockwall_normalmap_filter.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Use the settings depicted in the image above and then apply the normalmap color information to the image by by clicking OK.
<br /><br />5. Now resize your image to 256x256. A 512x512 normalmap is overkill in this instance. 
<br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121080712im_/http://div.dyndns.org/vector/rockwall/rockwall_local.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />6. Save your normalmap as Doom_III/base/textures/custom/rockwall_local.tga
<br /><br />By convention, diffusemap texture names are denoted with a "_local" suffix.  I have no idea why this is.
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">III. Render a specularmap</span>
<br /><br />The specular map stage allows specular hightlights to be added to the material. Specular highlights give the surface a shiny, light-reflective look.  In the case of our rock wall, it will give the rock a slightly wet look.  Because the specularmap is an additive blend, light areas of the specularmap will create drastic specular highlights while dark areas will create none.
<br /><br />For now, lets just use simple fractal clouds to generate the specular map.
<br /><br />1. Create new 256x256 RGB image 
<br /><br />2. Filter -&gt; Render -&gt; Clouds
<br /><br />3. Image -&gt; Adjust -&gt; Auto Contrast
<br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121080712im_/http://div.dyndns.org/vector/rockwall/rockwall_s.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />The lighter regions of the texture will translate to shiny areas (specular highlights) on the final material.
<br /><br />4. Save your specularmap as Doom_III/base/textures/custom/rockwall_s.tga
<br /><br />By convention, diffusemap texture names are denoted with a "_s" suffix.
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">IV. Create a DOOMEdit Preview image</span>
<br /><br />This final image will serve as a material preview when working in DOOMEdit.  
<br /><br />1. Open up your newly create rockwall_local.tga and rockwall_d.tga images.
<br /><br />2. Create a new 256x256 RGB image and call it "rockwall_ed"
<br /><br />3. Copy the entire contents of rockwall_d.tga and paste it as a new layer into your new "rockwall_ed" image.
<br /><br />4. Copy the entire contents of rockwall_local.tga and paste it as a new layer into "rockwall_ed", on top of the layer you just pasted from rockwall_d.
<br /><br />5. Apply the following functions to the top layer of "rockwall_ed" (the layer containing the normalmap source).
<br /><br />	a. Image -&gt; Adjust -&gt; Desaturate
<br />	b. Image -&gt; Adjust -&gt; Auto Contrast
<br /><br />6. Now change the blending mode of the top layer from "Normal" to "Overlay".  This is done from the "Layers" tab.
<br /><br />This should give you a shaded and colorized version of your material.
<br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121080712im_/http://div.dyndns.org/vector/rockwall/rockwall_ed.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />7. Save your editor image as Doom_III/base/textures/custom/rockwall_ed.tga
<br /><br />By convention, editor preview texture names are denoted with a "_ed" suffix. However, I have seen this convention broken in the Doom3 alpha materials.
<br /><br />=================
<br /><br />That wraps up our image creation.  Now lets create a quick material script to pull all of our images into a great looking Doom3 material.
<br /><br />Open up your favorite text editing program and let's add the following code to a blank text file:
<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">textures/custom/rockwall<br />{<br />    qer_editorimage  textures/custom/rockwall_ed.tga       // custom DOOMEdit material preview image<br /><br />    diffusemap       textures/custom/rockwall_d.tga        // color and value information for the material<br />    specularmap      textures/custom/rockwall_s.tga        // specular highlights<br />    bumpmap          textures/custom/rockwall_local.tga    // normalmap for bumpmapped appearance<br />}</div><br /><br />Now save your text file as Doom_III/base/materials/custom.mtr.<br /><br />=================<br /><br />We're all done with the material creation process.  Now fire up DOOMEdit and place the new material on some brush faces.  The material can be accessed from the Media Browser (shortcut: 'M' key) under "materials/textures/custom/rockwall".  <br /><br />After assigning the material to some brushes, bring up the Doom console and use "testmap yourmapname" to compile and test the map.<br /><br />See the shiny highlights ingame?  Those are the specular highlights that give the rocky surface a slippery wet look.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Some final thoughts:</span><br /><br />DoomEdit handles materials much better than Radiant handled shaders. No more 'shaderlist.txt' registrations (w00t!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121080712im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":grin:" title="Very Happy" /> ). DoomEdit automatically makes accessable every valid material found in any file in the 'materials' folder.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"> <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121080712im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" />  IMPORTANT  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121080712im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" /></span><br /><br />For those of you working on image creation and modification, I HIGHLY recommend turning Doom3's texture caching off.  Do this at the console by typing the following:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">image_usePrecompressedTextures 0</div>
<br /><br />By default, Doom3 is set up to create a cache of all images. This cache is generated the first time an image is used by the system. This cache doesn't automatically update if image modifications are made, therefore you will not see changes you make to images unless the cache is disabled.  This really screwed with my head for quite some time.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121080712im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_evil.gif" alt=":evil:" title="Evil or Very Mad" />  Having caching turned off will increase load times, but it appears to be the only (?) way for you to see image modifications reflected in the engine.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p4839" date="Posted: Sat Mar 01, 2003 2:13 pm "><author>TheCray_nz</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I'm glad to see I'm not the only one using this approach, but a few things which I personally think make the end result better (and you might as well)
<br />First, Use a scale of around 8 - 16 in the normal map filter.
<br />Next, greyscale the final image, and run image-&gt;adjust-&gt;Auto Levels over it.
<br />Then copy, paste and overlay the result into your diffuse texture. Finally, tinker with the opacity of the normalmap layer before flattening (I like 75% opacity).

<br />But I wouldn't have if it wasn't for this awesome site, thanks for existing.
<br /><br />Thanx to rich in particular, the test bump map link made the difference.
<br />Now that this is working, I feel alot better about spending the 108.oo for
<br />adobe photoshop, &amp; all night carefully reading the 8 pages of this thread 
<br />like 8 times.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121080319im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /><br /><br />The problem for me was adding --&gt; .mtr &amp; .tga &lt;-- at the end of my file
<br />names. But I still have them in my MTR script. 
<br /><br />I do have a question though, appearantly the nvidia plugin is some what
<br />updated. The "Auto Contrast" is nolonger under "Image/Adjust", it's under
<br />"Enhance" now. I never found an "unsaturate though". I assumed it was

<br /><br /><br />Greeting fellow Doom haxors.  I've put together the first installment of a two part semi-exhuastive study of Doom 3 material creation.  Enjoy...
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Some housekeeping before we get started:</span>
<br /><br />First of all, we will need to download NVidia's NormalMapFilter plug-in for Photoshop.  The plug-in can be downloaded here:
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121081733/http://developer.nvidia.com/docs/IO/1176/ATT/NormalMapFilter.8bf">http://developer.nvidia.com/docs/IO/117 ... Filter.8bf</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />This file needs to be placed in Photoshop's filter plug-ins directory.  The plug-ins directory should contain other .8bf files.  More information about the NVidia filter and its uses can be found here:
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121081733/http://www.cyberloonies.com/bump-mapping.html">http://www.cyberloonies.com/bump-mapping.html</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />Create a new folder called "custom/" in "Doom_III/base/textures/".  This is where we will save our new textures for our material stages.
<br /><br />=================
<br /><br />Now for the fun stuff.  Open up Photoshop and let's draw the stages.
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">I. Draw a diffusemap texture</span>
<br /><br />This stage will serve primarily as color information for the material.  This is basically just a standard RGB texture with dimensions based on powers of 2.  The image should contain color and value information.  A simple flat brown texture would work fine, but I whipped up this seamlessly tiling example by playing around with the drawing tools.
<br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121081733im_/http://div.dyndns.org/vector/rockwall/rockwall_d.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Save your diffusemap as Doom_III/base/textures/custom/rockwall_d.tga
<br />By convention, diffusemap texture names are denoted with a "_d" suffix.
<br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121081733im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" />  Make sure to save all your material textures as Targas because the Doom3 alpha leak doesn't seem to like Jpegs.  For this tutorial, save all targas as 24-bit as we will not be making use of an alpha channel.
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">II. Render a normalmap</span>
<br /><br />A normalmap contains per-pixel dynamic lighting information. Essentially, it uses the color information for each pixel to determine the direction from which a light source would highlight the pixel.  A normalmap can be generated from an elevation map through NVidia's wonderful little NormalMapFilter Photoshop plug-in.
<br /><br />1. Create new 512x512 RGB image as the NormalMapFilter only works on images with dimensions based on powers of 2.
<br /><br />2. Select White as foreground and black as background
<br /><br />3. From the pulldown menus select: Filter -&gt; Render -&gt; Clouds
<br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121081733im_/http://div.dyndns.org/vector/rockwall/rockwall_h.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />This cloud pattern serves as an elevation map for the NormalMapFilter plug-in.  In the elevation map, white represents high spots on the texture and black represents low spots.
<br /><br />Now, if your image for some reason is not flattened, flatten it now: 
<br />Layer -&gt; Flatten Image
<br /><br />4. Now apply NVidia's normalmap filter: Filter -&gt; nvTools -&gt; NormalMapFilter
<br /><br />You may get a warning message about channel selection and alphaheight. This is not a problem. Just click on OK.
<br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121081733im_/http://div.dyndns.org/vector/rockwall/rockwall_normalmap_filter.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Use the settings depicted in the image above and then apply the normalmap color information to the image by by clicking OK.
<br /><br />5. Now resize your image to 256x256. A 512x512 normalmap is overkill in this instance. 
<br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121081733im_/http://div.dyndns.org/vector/rockwall/rockwall_local.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />6. Save your normalmap as Doom_III/base/textures/custom/rockwall_local.tga
<br /><br />By convention, diffusemap texture names are denoted with a "_local" suffix.  I have no idea why this is.
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">III. Render a specularmap</span>
<br /><br />The specular map stage allows specular hightlights to be added to the material. Specular highlights give the surface a shiny, light-reflective look.  In the case of our rock wall, it will give the rock a slightly wet look.  Because the specularmap is an additive blend, light areas of the specularmap will create drastic specular highlights while dark areas will create none.
<br /><br />For now, lets just use simple fractal clouds to generate the specular map.
<br /><br />1. Create new 256x256 RGB image 
<br /><br />2. Filter -&gt; Render -&gt; Clouds
<br /><br />3. Image -&gt; Adjust -&gt; Auto Contrast
<br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121081733im_/http://div.dyndns.org/vector/rockwall/rockwall_s.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />The lighter regions of the texture will translate to shiny areas (specular highlights) on the final material.
<br /><br />4. Save your specularmap as Doom_III/base/textures/custom/rockwall_s.tga
<br /><br />By convention, diffusemap texture names are denoted with a "_s" suffix.
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">IV. Create a DOOMEdit Preview image</span>
<br /><br />This final image will serve as a material preview when working in DOOMEdit.  
<br /><br />1. Open up your newly create rockwall_local.tga and rockwall_d.tga images.
<br /><br />2. Create a new 256x256 RGB image and call it "rockwall_ed"
<br /><br />3. Copy the entire contents of rockwall_d.tga and paste it as a new layer into your new "rockwall_ed" image.
<br /><br />4. Copy the entire contents of rockwall_local.tga and paste it as a new layer into "rockwall_ed", on top of the layer you just pasted from rockwall_d.
<br /><br />5. Apply the following functions to the top layer of "rockwall_ed" (the layer containing the normalmap source).
<br /><br />	a. Image -&gt; Adjust -&gt; Desaturate
<br />	b. Image -&gt; Adjust -&gt; Auto Contrast
<br /><br />6. Now change the blending mode of the top layer from "Normal" to "Overlay".  This is done from the "Layers" tab.
<br /><br />This should give you a shaded and colorized version of your material.
<br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121081733im_/http://div.dyndns.org/vector/rockwall/rockwall_ed.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />7. Save your editor image as Doom_III/base/textures/custom/rockwall_ed.tga
<br /><br />By convention, editor preview texture names are denoted with a "_ed" suffix. However, I have seen this convention broken in the Doom3 alpha materials.
<br /><br />=================
<br /><br />That wraps up our image creation.  Now lets create a quick material script to pull all of our images into a great looking Doom3 material.
<br /><br />Open up your favorite text editing program and let's add the following code to a blank text file:
<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">textures/custom/rockwall<br />{<br />    qer_editorimage  textures/custom/rockwall_ed.tga       // custom DOOMEdit material preview image<br /><br />    diffusemap       textures/custom/rockwall_d.tga        // color and value information for the material<br />    specularmap      textures/custom/rockwall_s.tga        // specular highlights<br />    bumpmap          textures/custom/rockwall_local.tga    // normalmap for bumpmapped appearance<br />}</div><br /><br />Now save your text file as Doom_III/base/materials/custom.mtr.<br /><br />=================<br /><br />We're all done with the material creation process.  Now fire up DOOMEdit and place the new material on some brush faces.  The material can be accessed from the Media Browser (shortcut: 'M' key) under "materials/textures/custom/rockwall".  <br /><br />After assigning the material to some brushes, bring up the Doom console and use "testmap yourmapname" to compile and test the map.<br /><br />See the shiny highlights ingame?  Those are the specular highlights that give the rocky surface a slippery wet look.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Some final thoughts:</span><br /><br />DoomEdit handles materials much better than Radiant handled shaders. No more 'shaderlist.txt' registrations (w00t!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121081733im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":grin:" title="Very Happy" /> ). DoomEdit automatically makes accessable every valid material found in any file in the 'materials' folder.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"> <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121081733im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" />  IMPORTANT  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121081733im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" /></span><br /><br />For those of you working on image creation and modification, I HIGHLY recommend turning Doom3's texture caching off.  Do this at the console by typing the following:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">image_usePrecompressedTextures 0</div>
<br /><br />By default, Doom3 is set up to create a cache of all images. This cache is generated the first time an image is used by the system. This cache doesn't automatically update if image modifications are made, therefore you will not see changes you make to images unless the cache is disabled.  This really screwed with my head for quite some time.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121081733im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_evil.gif" alt=":evil:" title="Evil or Very Mad" />  Having caching turned off will increase load times, but it appears to be the only (?) way for you to see image modifications reflected in the engine.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p4839" date="Posted: Sat Mar 01, 2003 2:13 pm "><author>TheCray_nz</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I'm glad to see I'm not the only one using this approach, but a few things which I personally think make the end result better (and you might as well)
<br />First, Use a scale of around 8 - 16 in the normal map filter.
<br />Next, greyscale the final image, and run image-&gt;adjust-&gt;Auto Levels over it.
<br />Then copy, paste and overlay the result into your diffuse texture. Finally, tinker with the opacity of the normalmap layer before flattening (I like 75% opacity).

<br /><br />Compression in memory is to save space on the card.  Compression on disk makes your download smaller. 
<br />Although since pk3's compress also, it depends on the image whether a jpeg will be smaller than a zipped targa.  The less color variation in an image, the smaller the jpeg gets - a black image will make for a jpeg of just a few KB regardless of dimensions.

<br /><br />sry, about that man. 
<br />Heres what i've done:
<br /><br />1. I've extracted allmost all my paks into a folder named doom3test (c:/doom3test)
<br />2. I placed my texture tga's into a new folder named 'custom' (c:/doom3test/pak001/dds/textures/custom/whitewall_d,s,local.tga)
<br />3. I created a new text document in my 'materials' folder (c:/doom3test/pak000/materials/custom.mtr)
<br />4 i used this code: 
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">c:/doom3test/pak001/dds/textures/custom/whitewall<br />{ <br />    qer_editorimage  c:/doom3test/pak001/dds/textures/custom/whitewall_d.tga <br />    diffusemap       c:/doom3test/pak001/dds/textures/custom/whitewall_d.tga        <br />    specularmap     c:/doom3test/pak001/dds/textures/custom/whitewall_s.tga    <br />    bumpmap        c:/doom3test/pak001/dds/textures/custom/whitewall_local.tga<br />}</div>
<br /><br />to point the .mtr towards the texture files (just like in the tut)
<br /><br />5. I started up doom3edit and pressed M to bring up the material browser.
<br />6. I clicked on textures.
<br />7.I scrolled down.
<br /><br />But my custom folder wasn't there. Have i done something wrong in the code? I am i just an idiot and i've done somethig retardedly simple wrong.
<br /><br />Please bestow what is left on your patience on an eager-to-learn kid.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p52622" date="Posted: Thu Sep 23, 2004 3:57 am "><author>rich_is_bored</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Consider the doom3test directory a reference and nothing more.
<br /><br />When you create new content for the game you'll need to place that inside the Doom 3 folder.
<br /><br />So, move all your custom targas into <span style="font-weight: bold">[Your Doom 3 Directory]</span>\base\textures\custom.
<br /><br />Then, move your MTR file into <span style="font-weight: bold">[Your Doom 3 Directory]</span>\base\materials.
<br /><br />Then open the MTR file and change it to look like this...
<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">textures/custom/whitewall<br />{<br />    qer_editorimage  textures/custom/whitewall_d.tga<br />    diffusemap       textures/custom/whitewall_d.tga       <br />    specularmap     textures/custom/whitewall_s.tga   <br />    bumpmap        textures/custom/whitewall_local.tga<br />}</div><br /><br />Now, what you'll notice is that I left out the entire path because doom 3 only looks at the relative path from the base folder. So, when you tell the game to look in c:/doom3test/pak001/dds/textures/custom/ you're actually telling the game to look in <span style="font-weight: bold">[Your Doom 3 Directory]</span>c:/doom3test/pak001/dds/textures/custom/ which doesn't exist.<br /><br />I'm also going to break down the material shader format real quick just to give you a push in the right direction...<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">NAME_OF_TEXTURE<br />{<br />   IMAGE/BLEND_TYPE      RELATIVE_PATH/FILENAME<br />}</div>
<br /><br />So, in your new shader textures/custom/whitewall is the name of the texture and does not represent a physical path to the texture. However, in the media browser your texture will be listed in textures/custom/. This is strictly for organization in the editor.
<br /><br />You could name your material textures/zippity/do/da/whitewall and while that folder does not exist physically, you'd find your texture in that location in the editor.

<br /><br /><br />Greeting fellow Doom haxors.  I've put together the first installment of a two part semi-exhuastive study of Doom 3 material creation.  Enjoy...
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Some housekeeping before we get started:</span>
<br /><br />First of all, we will need to download NVidia's NormalMapFilter plug-in for Photoshop.  The plug-in can be downloaded here:
<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080418195734/http://developer.nvidia.com/docs/IO/1176/ATT/NormalMapFilter.8bf">http://developer.nvidia.com/docs/IO/117 ... Filter.8bf</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />This file needs to be placed in Photoshop's filter plug-ins directory.  The plug-ins directory should contain other .8bf files.  More information about the NVidia filter and its uses can be found here:
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080418195734/http://www.cyberloonies.com/bump-mapping.html">http://www.cyberloonies.com/bump-mapping.html</a><!-- m -->
<br /><br />Create a new folder called "custom/" in "Doom_III/base/textures/".  This is where we will save our new textures for our material stages.
<br /><br />=================
<br /><br />Now for the fun stuff.  Open up Photoshop and let's draw the stages.
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">I. Draw a diffusemap texture</span>
<br /><br />This stage will serve primarily as color information for the material.  This is basically just a standard RGB texture with dimensions based on powers of 2.  The image should contain color and value information.  A simple flat brown texture would work fine, but I whipped up this seamlessly tiling example by playing around with the drawing tools.
<br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080418195734im_/http://div.dyndns.org/vector/rockwall/rockwall_d.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Save your diffusemap as Doom_III/base/textures/custom/rockwall_d.tga
<br />By convention, diffusemap texture names are denoted with a "_d" suffix.
<br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080418195734im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" />  Make sure to save all your material textures as Targas because the Doom3 alpha leak doesn't seem to like Jpegs.  For this tutorial, save all targas as 24-bit as we will not be making use of an alpha channel.
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">II. Render a normalmap</span>
<br /><br />A normalmap contains per-pixel dynamic lighting information. Essentially, it uses the color information for each pixel to determine the direction from which a light source would highlight the pixel.  A normalmap can be generated from an elevation map through NVidia's wonderful little NormalMapFilter Photoshop plug-in.
<br /><br />1. Create new 512x512 RGB image as the NormalMapFilter only works on images with dimensions based on powers of 2.
<br /><br />2. Select White as foreground and black as background
<br /><br />3. From the pulldown menus select: Filter -&gt; Render -&gt; Clouds
<br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080418195734im_/http://div.dyndns.org/vector/rockwall/rockwall_h.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />This cloud pattern serves as an elevation map for the NormalMapFilter plug-in.  In the elevation map, white represents high spots on the texture and black represents low spots.
<br /><br />Now, if your image for some reason is not flattened, flatten it now: 
<br />Layer -&gt; Flatten Image
<br /><br />4. Now apply NVidia's normalmap filter: Filter -&gt; nvTools -&gt; NormalMapFilter
<br /><br />You may get a warning message about channel selection and alphaheight. This is not a problem. Just click on OK.
<br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080418195734im_/http://div.dyndns.org/vector/rockwall/rockwall_normalmap_filter.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Use the settings depicted in the image above and then apply the normalmap color information to the image by by clicking OK.
<br /><br />5. Now resize your image to 256x256. A 512x512 normalmap is overkill in this instance. 
<br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080418195734im_/http://div.dyndns.org/vector/rockwall/rockwall_local.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />6. Save your normalmap as Doom_III/base/textures/custom/rockwall_local.tga
<br /><br />By convention, diffusemap texture names are denoted with a "_local" suffix.  I have no idea why this is.
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">III. Render a specularmap</span>
<br /><br />The specular map stage allows specular hightlights to be added to the material. Specular highlights give the surface a shiny, light-reflective look.  In the case of our rock wall, it will give the rock a slightly wet look.  Because the specularmap is an additive blend, light areas of the specularmap will create drastic specular highlights while dark areas will create none.
<br /><br />For now, lets just use simple fractal clouds to generate the specular map.
<br /><br />1. Create new 256x256 RGB image 
<br /><br />2. Filter -&gt; Render -&gt; Clouds
<br /><br />3. Image -&gt; Adjust -&gt; Auto Contrast
<br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080418195734im_/http://div.dyndns.org/vector/rockwall/rockwall_s.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />The lighter regions of the texture will translate to shiny areas (specular highlights) on the final material.
<br /><br />4. Save your specularmap as Doom_III/base/textures/custom/rockwall_s.tga
<br /><br />By convention, diffusemap texture names are denoted with a "_s" suffix.
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">IV. Create a DOOMEdit Preview image</span>
<br /><br />This final image will serve as a material preview when working in DOOMEdit.  
<br /><br />1. Open up your newly create rockwall_local.tga and rockwall_d.tga images.
<br /><br />2. Create a new 256x256 RGB image and call it "rockwall_ed"
<br /><br />3. Copy the entire contents of rockwall_d.tga and paste it as a new layer into your new "rockwall_ed" image.
<br /><br />4. Copy the entire contents of rockwall_local.tga and paste it as a new layer into "rockwall_ed", on top of the layer you just pasted from rockwall_d.
<br /><br />5. Apply the following functions to the top layer of "rockwall_ed" (the layer containing the normalmap source).
<br /><br />	a. Image -&gt; Adjust -&gt; Desaturate
<br />	b. Image -&gt; Adjust -&gt; Auto Contrast
<br /><br />6. Now change the blending mode of the top layer from "Normal" to "Overlay".  This is done from the "Layers" tab.
<br /><br />This should give you a shaded and colorized version of your material.
<br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080418195734im_/http://div.dyndns.org/vector/rockwall/rockwall_ed.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />7. Save your editor image as Doom_III/base/textures/custom/rockwall_ed.tga
<br /><br />By convention, editor preview texture names are denoted with a "_ed" suffix. However, I have seen this convention broken in the Doom3 alpha materials.
<br /><br />=================
<br /><br />That wraps up our image creation.  Now lets create a quick material script to pull all of our images into a great looking Doom3 material.
<br /><br />Open up your favorite text editing program and let's add the following code to a blank text file:
<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">textures/custom/rockwall<br />{<br />    qer_editorimage  textures/custom/rockwall_ed.tga       // custom DOOMEdit material preview image<br /><br />    diffusemap       textures/custom/rockwall_d.tga        // color and value information for the material<br />    specularmap      textures/custom/rockwall_s.tga        // specular highlights<br />    bumpmap          textures/custom/rockwall_local.tga    // normalmap for bumpmapped appearance<br />}</div><br /><br />Now save your text file as Doom_III/base/materials/custom.mtr.<br /><br />=================<br /><br />We're all done with the material creation process.  Now fire up DOOMEdit and place the new material on some brush faces.  The material can be accessed from the Media Browser (shortcut: 'M' key) under "materials/textures/custom/rockwall".  <br /><br />After assigning the material to some brushes, bring up the Doom console and use "testmap yourmapname" to compile and test the map.<br /><br />See the shiny highlights ingame?  Those are the specular highlights that give the rocky surface a slippery wet look.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Some final thoughts:</span><br /><br />DoomEdit handles materials much better than Radiant handled shaders. No more 'shaderlist.txt' registrations (w00t!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080418195734im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":grin:" title="Very Happy" /> ). DoomEdit automatically makes accessable every valid material found in any file in the 'materials' folder.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"> <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080418195734im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" />  IMPORTANT  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080418195734im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" /></span><br /><br />For those of you working on image creation and modification, I HIGHLY recommend turning Doom3's texture caching off.  Do this at the console by typing the following:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">image_usePrecompressedTextures 0</div>
<br /><br />By default, Doom3 is set up to create a cache of all images. This cache is generated the first time an image is used by the system. This cache doesn't automatically update if image modifications are made, therefore you will not see changes you make to images unless the cache is disabled.  This really screwed with my head for quite some time.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080418195734im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_evil.gif" alt=":evil:" title="Evil or Very Mad" />  Having caching turned off will increase load times, but it appears to be the only (?) way for you to see image modifications reflected in the engine.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p4839" date="Posted: Sat Mar 01, 2003 2:13 pm "><author>TheCray_nz</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I'm glad to see I'm not the only one using this approach, but a few things which I personally think make the end result better (and you might as well)
<br />First, Use a scale of around 8 - 16 in the normal map filter.
<br />Next, greyscale the final image, and run image-&gt;adjust-&gt;Auto Levels over it.
<br />Then copy, paste and overlay the result into your diffuse texture. Finally, tinker with the opacity of the normalmap layer before flattening (I like 75% opacity).
