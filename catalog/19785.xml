<br />It would be cool to have clear .pk4 with everything that is needed for custom model, full hierarchy.
<br />I mean for model that doesn't 'inherit' anything and use its own files. Def, skins, materials, mesnes, anims, sounds. I guess it would be a copy of default MP player with all files renamed.
<br /><br />I'm an artist and all this script-stuff is a mystery to me.
<br /><br />P.S. I have seen and downloaded 'Spaceman' PPM for example, but it inherits model_player_marine and no sign of custom sounds used.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p180755" date="Posted: Tue Jun 12, 2007 2:36 pm "><author>AnthonyJa</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Inheriting from another def isnt necessarily a bad thing. If the skeleton for your model matches the marine well enough that you can share some of the animations, even if not all of them, then it could save you some work. If you dont inherit from model_player_marine you'll need to make sure all of the animations that are in exposed have the same names (although ultimately, a full new set of anims would be good). 
<br /><br />As for sounds, add items to the playerModel {} definition, such as:
<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">playerModel model_player_failed_transfer {<br />	"model"			"model_player_failed_transfer"<br />	"def_head"		""<br />	"skin"			""<br />	"description"		"#str_108000"<br /><br />	"snd_death"			"corpse_death"<br />	"snd_footstep"			"corpse_step"<br />	"snd_gear2"				"corpse_flesh"<br />	"snd_land_soft" 		"corpse_land_soft"<br />	"snd_land_hard" "corpse_land_hard"<br /><br />}<br /></div>
<br /><br />You can override any snd_* key's from player_marine_mp. Any sounds you dont specify will be picked up from the marine (and in q4max's case, strogg if its marked as a strogg). If you're at the point where you're trying to integrate your model and struggling, poke me on IRC and I'll see if I can answer specific q's.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p182980" date="Posted: Thu Jul 05, 2007 9:06 am "><author>dw</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Sorry for late reply, was too thrilled painting textures and fighting with xNormal.
