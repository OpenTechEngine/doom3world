<br />the title is a little misleading but also the title of another tutorial really didnt explain all its uses
<br />A func_shakeking can be used just like a func_pendulom but on any axis
<br />here is a link that briefly discusses how to use it

<br />here is another tutorial that got side tracked on how to create pistons and cranks the later parts of the thread touch on how func_shaking can be used this way and in other ways as well

<br />I figured I needed another link that maybe gave a clearer idea of the possiblilities because the original title about rotating fans was misleading  if you wernt looking to make a fan then you might miss it</div>]]></body></post></posts></thread></xml>
