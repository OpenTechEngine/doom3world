<br /><br />On a more serious note there's an error in my first tutorial. I said that you can only print to the HUD with the help of a GUI script but I've recently discovered some text rendering functions in idRenderSystem.

I've sent an e-mail to iddevnet so if I get an answer I'll write a tutorial on fonts and how to render to the HUD without using a GUI. I'll also put a correction notice in my first tutorial.
<br /><br />Alright, on to the tutorial. Tracelines! Comments welcome as usual.

<br /><br />Thanks for this tutorial.

For example. I wanted to trace to an backpack which is an idItem. So I put CONTENTS_RENDERMODEL because it sounded good to me and the comment says "used for render models for collision detection". It is not. a backpack is a CONTENTS_MOVEABLECLIP. Of course this is rather easy to figure out because I wrote a loop that tests all flags and writes it to alog, so I can look which one triggers it. The comments for the masks are not really helpful, but maybe it is only because I'm not an native english speaker?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p61338" date="Posted: Fri Nov 05, 2004 3:28 am "><author>Trevor</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks for changing the name of the thread and making it sticky.
<br /><br />sparhawk - The trace masks are actually pretty confusing. I'd just go with experimentation like you've been doing.
<br /><br />Here's a new tutorial on weapon scripts. This is a general info tutorial - there are no specific examples and it just tries to explain how idWeapon interacts with the weapon scripts. I spent a lot of time tracing through the idWeapon class so it makes a lot of sense to me right now but after reading it over it sounds kind of confusing. Let me know what you think.

<br /><br />I'll probably work on some specific examples for part 2 like alternate firing modes (I know it's already been done) and anything else I can think of.

<br /><br />Thanks for the tutorials. They are really helpfull. But could you edit all your tutorials into the first posting?

<br /><br />I've also added a new tutorial. This one is really cool. It goes through modifying the BFG ball so that it blows up into tons of plasma balls which ricochet around the room. I'm extremely happy with it. If you want the full effect try it out in testmaps/test_box. Also, I played around with the ricochet code on my own and as I mentioned in the tutorial if you apply a ricochet to the BFG ball it looks awesome.
<br /><br />I'd love any comments on this one in particular.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p65717" date="Posted: Thu Dec 02, 2004 5:40 am "><author>rich_is_bored</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">That looks really cool Trevor. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081122113537im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p68559" date="Posted: Mon Dec 20, 2004 3:56 pm "><author>just1n</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Pretty sweet.

<br /><br />On a more serious note there's an error in my first tutorial. I said that you can only print to the HUD with the help of a GUI script but I've recently discovered some text rendering functions in idRenderSystem. Unfortunately I'm having a heck of a time trying to get them to work. They work fine with the "textures/bigchars" material but I don't know how to use the actual game fonts (an, bank, or micro). I've sent an e-mail to iddevnet so if I get an answer I'll write a tutorial on fonts and how to render to the HUD without using a GUI. I'll also put a correction notice in my first tutorial.
<br /><br />Alright, on to the tutorial. Tracelines! Comments welcome as usual.

<br /><br />Thanks for this tutorial. It really made my day!!! <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225030606im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Now my code works, because I noticed one essential thing in your tut. I used GetEyePosition() for the trace start and never put the player as the entity that has to be ignored, so I always got my player back as an answer. Now that i noticed that I could get my code to working within minutes. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225030606im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />One sidenote: I'm still confused as how the masks relate to the gameworld. For example. I wanted to trace to an backpack which is an idItem. So I put CONTENTS_RENDERMODEL because it sounded good to me and the comment says "used for render models for collision detection". It is not. a backpack is a CONTENTS_MOVEABLECLIP. Of course this is rather easy to figure out because I wrote a loop that tests all flags and writes it to alog, so I can look which one triggers it. The comments for the masks are not really helpful, but maybe it is only because I'm not an native english speaker?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p61338" date="Posted: Fri Nov 05, 2004 3:28 am "><author>Trevor</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks for changing the name of the thread and making it sticky.
<br /><br />sparhawk - The trace masks are actually pretty confusing. I'd just go with experimentation like you've been doing.
<br /><br />Here's a new tutorial on weapon scripts. This is a general info tutorial - there are no specific examples and it just tries to explain how idWeapon interacts with the weapon scripts. I spent a lot of time tracing through the idWeapon class so it makes a lot of sense to me right now but after reading it over it sounds kind of confusing. Let me know what you think.

I'm extremely happy with it. If you want the full effect try it out in testmaps/test_box. Also, I played around with the ricochet code on my own and as I mentioned in the tutorial if you apply a ricochet to the BFG ball it looks awesome.
<br /><br />I'd love any comments on this one in particular.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p65717" date="Posted: Thu Dec 02, 2004 5:40 am "><author>rich_is_bored</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">That looks really cool Trevor. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081122113537im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p68559" date="Posted: Mon Dec 20, 2004 3:56 pm "><author>just1n</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Pretty sweet.

Never done it before, hope to do it a lot <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081122113537im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />I tried tutorial 1's idStr example. Easy start. I put in the code common-&gt;Printf(...) in idPlayer::Think. Build it and place it in a subdirectory of my Doom3 installation dir...
<br /><br />Now to test it, I start doom, but my subdirectory doesn't show in the mods list. Fair enough, it's a test anyway, so I copy a pk4 file to my directory too. Now it's in the mod list, so I can load it. I create a game, but the message doesn't show up in console <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081122113537im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><br /><br />Any ideas? Also tried the _button5 example, same result...
<br /><br />Another question:
<br />Is it possible to start the dll in debug mode and use breakpoints? Using VS.NET 2003. Complains about no debug information in doom3.exe (duh), but still is there a way to do it?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p147104" date="Posted: Sat Jun 24, 2006 1:10 pm "><author>Giganoto</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Got it working.
