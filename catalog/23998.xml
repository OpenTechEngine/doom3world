And engine buyers are usually lazy programmers, so the only new things added are probably a handful. I'll just have to learn how to use the few extra special effects, by looking at the original maps.<br /><br />Why I want to do this? To show off at the Wolf3d and RtCW communities that I'm making maps for the new Wolfenstein <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320002118im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />Well, of course, unless this game explicitly prohibits custom map making, but I tend to doubt that...<br /><br />EDIT: oh now I see the "Wolfenstein SDK" thread. Gonna look through it.<br /><br />EDIT EDIT: hey do you happen to be that guy working on a Wolfenstein Doom 3 TC?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p227876" date="Posted: Sun Oct 10, 2010 11:57 pm "><author>The Happy Friar</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Wolf maps work differently then D3 maps.

But I'm just evaluating the value of discussion forums from a business perspective. It's possible some companies out there are being genuinely altruistic.<br /><br />That said I didn't say people shouldn't post documentation in discussion forums but it is pretty foolish to keep all your eggs in one basket. Lucky for us we can host our own content and post links so others can find it.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p229255" date="Posted: Mon Jan 10, 2011 9:29 pm "><author>Deadite4</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Susefreak wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">So a community shouldn't post documentation on the boards where a large part of the community resides.
