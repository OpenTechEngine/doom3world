We are in the final stretch for releasing the multiple award winning Coop Doom 3 Mod Last Man Standing Co-op 4.0!  We are estimating that 4.0 will be released in the next 1-2 weeks!!  Currently we are working on incorporating the optimized Classic Doom for Doom 3 1.3.1 maps into LMS.  For more information on that mod check out <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081119153625/http://cdoom.d3files.com/">http://Cdoom.d3files.com</a><!-- m -->  LMS 4.0 will also include numerous map fixes/tweaks especially to the SP Coop levels.  Heruncle has put a lot of work into preventing players from telefragging and many other fixes that make the levels much more fun to play.  In addition there is a new map from Alucard called TS_Hellpentagram to give us now over 80 maps tweaked for Co-op play!  If you are interested in helping to test 4.0 as we put together this final release of LMS please contact us either in the forums or IRC.<br /><br />There has been a lot of discussion as to what the next project will be for the LMS community.  One of the ideas that has been greatly discussed is the idea for a Standalone version of LMS.  If this were to happen Platinum Arts Sandbox is what would be used to create it.  As a note Sandbox Beta Beta 2.1 has already received over 3k downloads on fileplanet in less than two weeks.  You can find more information about Sandbox here:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081119153625/http://kids.platinumarts.net/">http://Kids.PlatinumArts.Net</a><!-- m --><br /><br />We are interested in your opinions on the matter and also seeing who would be interested in helping out.
