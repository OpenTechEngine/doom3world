<br /><br />i can import my model easy enough tho for some reason i have to export as a lightwave 5 object, or otherwise it won't work. but the texture never shows.
<br />as i understand from reading other posts, doom3 edit should import the diffuse texture by default, but its not working, if this works the way its supposed to the there is no need to uv bake?
<br /><br />as doom3 editor is very limited in modelling, can i make a whole map from lightwave and import (thinking nx01 style corridors)?

<br /><br />it doesn't seem to matter how i apply a texture in lightwave it just shows up as a black object in doom. i have tried
<br /><br />placing texture in different channels ie color//diffuse

<br />baking and applying a UV texture and using planer projection mapping
