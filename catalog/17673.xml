<br /><br />Kat has a good point, but after taking a second look I'd like to recommend to keep an even keener eye on the angle of the insets / bevels.
<br /><br />Everything that goes up or down in a straight 90 degree angle will simply look flat in a normalmap.
<br /><br />To avoid the loss of tiny detail during renderbump I suggest to shrink the "flat" faces of the UV map and stretch the faces carrying the detail.
<br />When I did early "crate" tests I had a lot of fun growing very detailed handles on the UV map to cover two thirds of the resulting skin.
<br />Needless to say it looked great ingame, albeit visual detail on the flat box sides appears to be a bit pixelated  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203022304im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" /><br /><br />My biggest hope of level-wide megatexturing is the unification of texture scaling for everything, world, mapobjects and characters (ok, give the player weapon and hands something in awsome max res).
<br /><br />Very often the skinning of mapobjects appears to be much more refined as compared to wall textures. This leads to the impression of low-res texturing as the viewer automaticall sees the highest resolution as the "normal" resolution while everything else gets judged as low res.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p160944" date="Posted: Sun Oct 29, 2006 3:58 am "><author>mikebart</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Nice work BJA, I like that you've kept a consistent style.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p173657" date="Posted: Wed Mar 21, 2007 1:49 pm "><author>BJA</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Long time no update but here's what I've got so far.

<br /><br />either that or use object space normalmaps instead of tangent, they're much better for anything static, you just cant rotate part of the mesh or the normals get miss-read but you can hide seams quite easily and you can get away with alot less chamfers on your mesh.
<br /><br />Just something to look into incase you dont already know, you might need a plugin for what ever app you're using.
<br /><br />But I think they're fine the way they are, im sure they'l get alot of use from mappers.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p173700" date="Posted: Wed Mar 21, 2007 9:06 pm "><author>Kiltron</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I encourage you to apply at id mate!

<br />Yeah, sometimes the UVs are a bit stretched and I could have used the texture space a bit more carefully.
<br /><br />@mikebart: thanks for the tip, have to try that! btw. I'm using 3ds max 7.
<br /><br />I noticed when looking at the models from doom3 that they mirrored a lot of UVs for the smaller models. I always thought that every piece should have his own texture space and you're not allowed to have overlapping vertices when dealing with normalmaps.
<br /><br />I also read that your lowpoly model should have only 1 smoothing group for making the normalmap in 3ds max and that you should make sure that you reset Xforms on your lowpoly model after finalizing the UV map. I tried that but the generated normalmap and the model looked kind of strange in doom3. And I really don't know what's that Xform modifier is for. Does it reset your modifier stack or what? (couldn't figure it out from the 3ds max reference).
<br /><br />More models will follow but for the next few weeks I don't have much time and actually no pc <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203022304im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />@Kiltron: thanks, but I guess you need a lot more than some lousy models and maps to get hired there <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203022304im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p173772" date="Posted: Thu Mar 22, 2007 2:18 pm "><author>obihb</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">The thing about having one smoothing group is more about seams then anything else. It is the safest way to make sure of the least seams. Because where 2 smoothing groups meet you will get a seam in the shading. It's a hard edge. This is because generating a normal map from a model with hard seams will miss out on some normals when the ray traces the high poly mesh.
<br /><br />It is however possible to make it a very hard to spot seam using Max's cage when rendering the normal map if you do have multiple smoothing groups. Because the cage will force the ray to still trace the full high poly mesh regardless of the smoothing groups. So this method is sort of in between. There are still seams but much harder to spot them.
<br /><br />On the other side of that, using the 1 smoothing group on something like a box can have a slight different effect in the shading where you'll spot the low poly triangle being shaded. Caused by the inaccuracy of the renderer. So there are cases where one way may be better than another. Or where you may choose to rather have some little seams compared to a bigger shading inaccuracy.
<br /><br />It just depends on the model and your own choices. It's still realtime game engine rendering so some inaccuracy is part of it.
<br /><br />I'll mention though that Max7 does not render the greatest normal maps for use in Doom3. I think if I remember correctly now there is an update to 7.5?. Either way, there is an update and this update renders much better normal maps. But the best maps can be rendered in Max8 and up. They are pretty much perfect for Doom.
<br /><br />I think your stuff looks good though. Really nicely done.
<br /><br />Oh, and about the texture space sharing. It's hard to come up with a scenario now where it's a problem, because you can share texture space. It's not like every triangle needs a unique UV space. I just can't think of the exact place where it might become a problem.
<br /><br />But it's basically because with normal maps you don't just "texture" your model, you also "shape" them. So if two shapes don't match but their textures do, you can't share that space even if you normally would by just having a diffuse map.
<br /><br />But you can for instance if you had a model with 10 poles sticking in it you can share the texture space of those 10 poles. As long as they line up 100% on the vertexes.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p173796" date="Posted: Thu Mar 22, 2007 9:34 pm "><author>BJA</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks a lot obihb, really informative post.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p205983" date="Posted: Sun Oct 12, 2008 6:23 am "><author>LDAsh</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Reminds me of Psychonauts, among other older titles, I love the slightly deflated, inwardly collapsing style of the house and the obscure angles, reminds me of my grandma's house! <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203055057im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br />Will this be seeing its way into any idTech engines or just for pics?

<br /><br />Kat has a good point, but after taking a second look I'd like to recommend to keep an even keener eye on the angle of the insets / bevels.
<br /><br />Everything that goes up or down in a straight 90 degree angle will simply look flat in a normalmap.
<br /><br />To avoid the loss of tiny detail during renderbump I suggest to shrink the "flat" faces of the UV map and stretch the faces carrying the detail.
<br />When I did early "crate" tests I had a lot of fun growing very detailed handles on the UV map to cover two thirds of the resulting skin.
<br />Needless to say it looked great ingame, albeit visual detail on the flat box sides appears to be a bit pixelated  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203022947im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" /><br /><br />My biggest hope of level-wide megatexturing is the unification of texture scaling for everything, world, mapobjects and characters (ok, give the player weapon and hands something in awsome max res).
<br /><br />Very often the skinning of mapobjects appears to be much more refined as compared to wall textures. This leads to the impression of low-res texturing as the viewer automaticall sees the highest resolution as the "normal" resolution while everything else gets judged as low res.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p160944" date="Posted: Sun Oct 29, 2006 3:58 am "><author>mikebart</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Nice work BJA, I like that you've kept a consistent style.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p173657" date="Posted: Wed Mar 21, 2007 1:49 pm "><author>BJA</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Long time no update but here's what I've got so far.

<br /><br />either that or use object space normalmaps instead of tangent, they're much better for anything static, you just cant rotate part of the mesh or the normals get miss-read but you can hide seams quite easily and you can get away with alot less chamfers on your mesh.
<br /><br />Just something to look into incase you dont already know, you might need a plugin for what ever app you're using.
<br /><br />But I think they're fine the way they are, im sure they'l get alot of use from mappers.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p173700" date="Posted: Wed Mar 21, 2007 9:06 pm "><author>Kiltron</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I encourage you to apply at id mate!

<br />Yeah, sometimes the UVs are a bit stretched and I could have used the texture space a bit more carefully.
<br /><br />@mikebart: thanks for the tip, have to try that! btw. I'm using 3ds max 7.
<br /><br />I noticed when looking at the models from doom3 that they mirrored a lot of UVs for the smaller models. I always thought that every piece should have his own texture space and you're not allowed to have overlapping vertices when dealing with normalmaps.
<br /><br />I also read that your lowpoly model should have only 1 smoothing group for making the normalmap in 3ds max and that you should make sure that you reset Xforms on your lowpoly model after finalizing the UV map. I tried that but the generated normalmap and the model looked kind of strange in doom3. And I really don't know what's that Xform modifier is for. Does it reset your modifier stack or what? (couldn't figure it out from the 3ds max reference).
<br /><br />More models will follow but for the next few weeks I don't have much time and actually no pc <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203022947im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />@Kiltron: thanks, but I guess you need a lot more than some lousy models and maps to get hired there <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203022947im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p173772" date="Posted: Thu Mar 22, 2007 2:18 pm "><author>obihb</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">The thing about having one smoothing group is more about seams then anything else. It is the safest way to make sure of the least seams. Because where 2 smoothing groups meet you will get a seam in the shading. It's a hard edge. This is because generating a normal map from a model with hard seams will miss out on some normals when the ray traces the high poly mesh.
<br /><br />It is however possible to make it a very hard to spot seam using Max's cage when rendering the normal map if you do have multiple smoothing groups. Because the cage will force the ray to still trace the full high poly mesh regardless of the smoothing groups. So this method is sort of in between. There are still seams but much harder to spot them.
<br /><br />On the other side of that, using the 1 smoothing group on something like a box can have a slight different effect in the shading where you'll spot the low poly triangle being shaded. Caused by the inaccuracy of the renderer. So there are cases where one way may be better than another. Or where you may choose to rather have some little seams compared to a bigger shading inaccuracy.
<br /><br />It just depends on the model and your own choices. It's still realtime game engine rendering so some inaccuracy is part of it.
<br /><br />I'll mention though that Max7 does not render the greatest normal maps for use in Doom3. I think if I remember correctly now there is an update to 7.5?. Either way, there is an update and this update renders much better normal maps. But the best maps can be rendered in Max8 and up. They are pretty much perfect for Doom.
<br /><br />I think your stuff looks good though. Really nicely done.
<br /><br />Oh, and about the texture space sharing. It's hard to come up with a scenario now where it's a problem, because you can share texture space. It's not like every triangle needs a unique UV space. I just can't think of the exact place where it might become a problem.
<br /><br />But it's basically because with normal maps you don't just "texture" your model, you also "shape" them. So if two shapes don't match but their textures do, you can't share that space even if you normally would by just having a diffuse map.
<br /><br />But you can for instance if you had a model with 10 poles sticking in it you can share the texture space of those 10 poles. As long as they line up 100% on the vertexes.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p173796" date="Posted: Thu Mar 22, 2007 9:34 pm "><author>BJA</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks a lot obihb, really informative post.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p196579" date="Posted: Mon Mar 17, 2008 3:40 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">agreed.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p196596" date="Posted: Mon Mar 17, 2008 10:55 am "><author>BJA</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks everybody <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203023014im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />@ratty: I don't have the uvw texture for those tentacles right now, but the layout isn't really that complicated.

<br /><br />Kat has a good point, but after taking a second look I'd like to recommend to keep an even keener eye on the angle of the insets / bevels.
<br /><br />Everything that goes up or down in a straight 90 degree angle will simply look flat in a normalmap.
<br /><br />To avoid the loss of tiny detail during renderbump I suggest to shrink the "flat" faces of the UV map and stretch the faces carrying the detail.
<br />When I did early "crate" tests I had a lot of fun growing very detailed handles on the UV map to cover two thirds of the resulting skin.
<br />Needless to say it looked great ingame, albeit visual detail on the flat box sides appears to be a bit pixelated  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080210192956im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed" /><br /><br />My biggest hope of level-wide megatexturing is the unification of texture scaling for everything, world, mapobjects and characters (ok, give the player weapon and hands something in awsome max res).
<br /><br />Very often the skinning of mapobjects appears to be much more refined as compared to wall textures. This leads to the impression of low-res texturing as the viewer automaticall sees the highest resolution as the "normal" resolution while everything else gets judged as low res.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p160944" date="Posted: Sun Oct 29, 2006 3:58 am "><author>mikebart</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Nice work BJA, I like that you've kept a consistent style.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p173657" date="Posted: Wed Mar 21, 2007 1:49 pm "><author>BJA</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Long time no update but here's what I've got so far.

<br /><br />either that or use object space normalmaps instead of tangent, they're much better for anything static, you just cant rotate part of the mesh or the normals get miss-read but you can hide seams quite easily and you can get away with alot less chamfers on your mesh.
<br /><br />Just something to look into incase you dont already know, you might need a plugin for what ever app you're using.
<br /><br />But I think they're fine the way they are, im sure they'l get alot of use from mappers.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p173700" date="Posted: Wed Mar 21, 2007 9:06 pm "><author>Kiltron</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I encourage you to apply at id mate!

<br />Yeah, sometimes the UVs are a bit stretched and I could have used the texture space a bit more carefully.
<br /><br />@mikebart: thanks for the tip, have to try that! btw. I'm using 3ds max 7.
<br /><br />I noticed when looking at the models from doom3 that they mirrored a lot of UVs for the smaller models. I always thought that every piece should have his own texture space and you're not allowed to have overlapping vertices when dealing with normalmaps.
<br /><br />I also read that your lowpoly model should have only 1 smoothing group for making the normalmap in 3ds max and that you should make sure that you reset Xforms on your lowpoly model after finalizing the UV map. I tried that but the generated normalmap and the model looked kind of strange in doom3. And I really don't know what's that Xform modifier is for. Does it reset your modifier stack or what? (couldn't figure it out from the 3ds max reference).
<br /><br />More models will follow but for the next few weeks I don't have much time and actually no pc <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080210192956im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />@Kiltron: thanks, but I guess you need a lot more than some lousy models and maps to get hired there <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080210192956im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p173772" date="Posted: Thu Mar 22, 2007 2:18 pm "><author>obihb</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">The thing about having one smoothing group is more about seams then anything else. It is the safest way to make sure of the least seams. Because where 2 smoothing groups meet you will get a seam in the shading. It's a hard edge. This is because generating a normal map from a model with hard seams will miss out on some normals when the ray traces the high poly mesh.
<br /><br />It is however possible to make it a very hard to spot seam using Max's cage when rendering the normal map if you do have multiple smoothing groups. Because the cage will force the ray to still trace the full high poly mesh regardless of the smoothing groups. So this method is sort of in between. There are still seams but much harder to spot them.
<br /><br />On the other side of that, using the 1 smoothing group on something like a box can have a slight different effect in the shading where you'll spot the low poly triangle being shaded. Caused by the inaccuracy of the renderer. So there are cases where one way may be better than another. Or where you may choose to rather have some little seams compared to a bigger shading inaccuracy.
<br /><br />It just depends on the model and your own choices. It's still realtime game engine rendering so some inaccuracy is part of it.
<br /><br />I'll mention though that Max7 does not render the greatest normal maps for use in Doom3. I think if I remember correctly now there is an update to 7.5?. Either way, there is an update and this update renders much better normal maps. But the best maps can be rendered in Max8 and up. They are pretty much perfect for Doom.
<br /><br />I think your stuff looks good though. Really nicely done.
<br /><br />Oh, and about the texture space sharing. It's hard to come up with a scenario now where it's a problem, because you can share texture space. It's not like every triangle needs a unique UV space. I just can't think of the exact place where it might become a problem.
<br /><br />But it's basically because with normal maps you don't just "texture" your model, you also "shape" them. So if two shapes don't match but their textures do, you can't share that space even if you normally would by just having a diffuse map.
<br /><br />But you can for instance if you had a model with 10 poles sticking in it you can share the texture space of those 10 poles. As long as they line up 100% on the vertexes.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p173796" date="Posted: Thu Mar 22, 2007 9:34 pm "><author>BJA</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks a lot obihb, really informative post.</div>]]></body></post></posts></thread></xml>
