How to make it glow green with differing intensity.<br /><br />Plus I would like to fade in the glow after the gargoyles activate.</div><br />Fading is the tricky part, but can be set up with triggers I think. I would use a combination of lights and texturing for this effect. First up the material stage:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">material   morghul_stone <br />{<br />      diffusemap     &lt;relative path to your diffuse texture here&gt;<br />      specularmap  &lt;relative path to your specular texture here&gt;<br />      bumpmap       &lt;relative path to your local normal texture here&gt;<br />       // Blend add stage here<br />      {<br />              blend add<br />              map     &lt;relative path to a light green tinted version of your texture here&gt;<br />              rgb   0.7       // add 70% of light, adjust this effect anywhere from 0 to 100 to your liking and brightness.<br />              <br />      }<br />}<br /></div><br />Remember: Added stages washout the bumpmap and specular effects so make sure to use it sparingly. That value of 0.7 is pretty high but maybe nescesary to achieve the effect you want. You'll have to play with that. For fading you will need to use material tables and something called the 'time' variable. Also remember that you need to make an extra texture in photoshop or another paintingprogram, the one which you will add in the added blend stage. This will be the self-lit stage. The artwork will decide for a large part the success of this effort I think. Setting up the materials is easy, but the texture artwork itself will have to be pretty darn neat to make it look that cool. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121082618im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />I remember in the making of, they said this effect took like 6 or 7 different effect layers to get right.<br /><br />I suggest you go to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121082618/http://www.iddevnet.com/doom3/materials.php" class="postlink">www.iddevnet.com</a>, this links you directly to the materials section where all of this (tables and material stages) is explained in great detail.
