That's a sum of 1 trillion EURO, roughly double the Paulson Plan in volume. However, keep in mind this is a guarantee, not a sum paid to anyone. As so often an insurance keeps the bad things from happen.<br /><br />Germans had been expecting a fair chance of bank runs. The need for physical cash money has increased strongly among all national banks as they report. That is, by all means, the overture of a bank run, call it bank walk if you want.<br /><br />This unilateral move will force most of our neighbour countries to do the same, otherwise private savings would get withdrawn in country.x and send to German banks. Good for Germany, bad for Europe and the whole situation unless all neighbours agree on the same terms, effectively turning Europe into a safe haven for private deposits.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p205763" date="Posted: Mon Oct 06, 2008 10:32 am "><author>BloodRayne</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">We just spent enough on just one Bank..  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081117160908im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p205765" date="Posted: Mon Oct 06, 2008 11:56 am "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">BloodRayne wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">We just spent enough on just one Bank..  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081117160908im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /></div><br /><br />Who is we and which bank?

I was talking to near-border bankers today and they all experience customers from European neighbour countries lining up for cash deposits in the 20k to 50k Euro range. That shouldn't be necessary since I believe everyone is equally save in their homecountries with savings in that range.<br /><br />As far as the bankers dirty little secret goes, we all know and always knew they throw far more money at the market as they have. That's why we need interbanking lending back up again.<br /><br />There are, by the way, plenty of industries where you make something from nothing and collect a profit. Just think what would happen if every insured car would crash into each other? Every health care insurance customer get's terminally sick? <br /><br />To be nitpicky, banks make something more out of something, not out of nothing. Only if you unwind everything there probably will be less. Every business to some extent makes some cut above something less, that's why they're profitable (unless they're boo.com).<br /><br />The market in general is under pressure and will continue to be so, but it's unlikely we'll have to unwind everything down to how do apples trade to peas.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p205762" date="Posted: Mon Oct 06, 2008 10:17 am "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Who would have thought that...<br /><br />The in face of disaster spreading from Hypo Real Estate last night the German government has decided to guarantee all bank deposits of private savings in Germany.
