<br /><br />I wish I had some screenshots to help, but I left them at work  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205022841im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><br /><br />I'll do my best to explain. 
<br /><br />I made a surface (select polygons - 'q' ) out of a portion of the gun. I then proceeded to 'Make UV' etc. The selected area is cylindrical on the Z axis; I'm sure of it, so I know that's not the issue. 
<br /><br />I made my UV in Photoshop and saved it into my textures archive in lightwave (1024x1024 texture, jpeg, max quality). However, the second I opened it up via image editor and layed the image over the actual UV, and applied it live to the texture-view of the model, the image became extremely low-res, as in it-looks-like-its-100x100-but-stretched-to-1000x1000 low-res. Very pixelated. Also, on my image for the purpose of the model I put the text "Model Version 1.21.3" and although it is very foggy on the model, I can tell that it's .. backwards/inverted/in 'mirror code' (incoherent on the model). 
<br /><br />I fixed it by realizing that every square on my grid (after I turned the grid back on via display options) measured 3 feet, whereas my image was a normal 72px/". So, I resized my 12 foot shotgun into a reasonable realistic size and changed the grid. It is now about 3 feet long, each square on the grid being 1 foot. It seemed to help somewhat, but just on the verge of 'noticable difference.' 
<br /><br />The next thing that I did was hit 'd' again for display, and I cannot recall what tab it was under right now, but I believe it was layout. Not sure. Either way, the value was something very low, in the 60's or 70's button. I hit the '1024' button and whatever it did, it apparently worked. The image now appears to be the correct resolution on the model, and is quite clear. 
<br /><br />But the text is also quite clearly backwards &gt;.^
<br /><br />Any help on re-doing this, or making sure all my images fit the model would be great!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p168126" date="Posted: Tue Jan 23, 2007 3:07 pm "><author>onu</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I can't get it to turn out right with cylindrical projection either.

<br /><br />I end up unwrapping everything manually, even simple objects, because it's the best way (that I know of) to get everything right with a minimal number of seams.
<br /><br />The orientation matters.  The text isn't reversed on the model, the UV just isn't oriented in the fashion you want.  I seriously believe it's Lightwave's method of unwrapping.  Using Atlas might produce better results, since it can go piece by piece that way, but then the skin will have more seams than is required.
<br /><br />This is why I would encourage you to start unwrapping manually.  It seems assinine for a cylinder, I know, but the more practice you get in the better off you'll be when you need to skin something more organic.
<br /><br />I use the method described in "approach 2" here: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205022841/http://www.newtek.com/products/lightwave/tutorials/uvmapping/character_UV/index.html" class="postlink">http://www.newtek.com/products/lightwave/tutorials/uvmapping/character_UV/index.html</a>
<br /><br />This method gives you total control over where the seams will be generated (important with bump mapping), as well as how much detail specific parts of your model will be relative to other parts (on a shotgun barrel, for instance, your pixels might be better spent with details along the circumference of the cylinder, as opposed to along the length).
<br /><br />And even if you ultimately go back to using projections for most of your UV maps, practice you get in with this method will help you be more bold when editing your UVs, and help you understand how inverted, rotated, skewed, and scaled triangles will affect your result.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p168186" date="Posted: Wed Jan 24, 2007 3:27 am "><author>Phobos</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Alright thanks man, I just scanned over it really quick. I'll have to go over it more in detail tomarrow when I'm working on the model. 
<br /><br />All that I did for that particular UV map was unwrap the 'black' part in the first picture. You can't really see that in the uvmap window [upper left] because I just made an entire square flat texture to put over it. I originally had a clean-cut texture, but I was having issues with a white line that kept showing up where the uv 'coordinates' were 'off' the plaine. 
<br /><br />For example, what should I do when I'm looking at the unwrapped model in the uv window, and not all of it fits into the black square? Just move it over, then PrintScreen and do the texture?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p168202" date="Posted: Wed Jan 24, 2007 4:13 am "><author>onu</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Phobos wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">...what should I do when I'm looking at the unwrapped model in the uv window, and not all of it fits into the black square? Just move it over, then PrintScreen and do the texture?</div>
<br /><br />Totally!  I can't see your mesh in the UV view in that screenshot, but I'm assuming you might also have to scale that part of the model down.
<br /><br />As far as printscreening for the texture...
<br /><br />I assume you're making this model for Doom 3.  That's all I model for so my workflow is, as far as I know, the quickest way from nothing to in-game with lightwave.  So let me describe how I do it.  Not saying your way is wrong, I realize that's the way it's done quite often (or I guess instead of printscreen a modeler more experienced than us might make a quick render in layout using the uv map, but I don't know how to do that).
<br /><br />Step: The First
<br />Anyways, I create the High Poly mesh first.  In this mesh I assign up to six different surfaces on the model, based on how I plan to skin it later.  I have a Red, Green, and Blue surface with smoothing on (for organics), and Red, Green, and Blue surface with smoothing off (for flat surfaces and harsh angles).  There's no need to set the color to actually be red, green, and blue until you're ready to renderbump.
<br /><br />Step: The Second
<br />I create the Low Poly mesh second.  It's easy to do with the High Poly mesh in the background.  I usually just draw the triangles by hand, with the add points tool, and then selecting points and either making a triangle, quad, triangle fan, or triangle bridge.  It's not as fast as merging surfaces, or using qemLOSS2 or a lot of other ways, but it's precise and puts all the right triangles in all the right places.
<br /><br />Step: The Second Jr.
<br />I create a morph map called "flat" and proceed to unwrap my UV map here.  This method is described pretty well in that article I linked earlier.  When I'm done I use the Planar projection with manual settings.  You can usually leave the Center variables alone, but you'll probably want to modify the Size variables so that they're even (i.e. not X of 1.18 m and Y of 1.12, you'd want both to be 1.18 if you're projecting on the Z plane).
<br /><br />Step: His Highness the Third
<br />Let's review what we have.  <ol style="list-style-type: arabic-numbers"><li>A high poly mesh with a handful of different colored surfaces.</li><li>A low poly mesh with a surface that points to our material and a UV map.</li></ol>  So now we make sure the material we're pointing to has the renderbump command, with "-colormap" specified.  Go to Doom3 and renderbump &lt;path_to_low_poly.lwo&gt;.
<br /><br />This should produce a bump map and a color map in the path we specified in the shader.  In photoshop I use the bumpmap to discern where the triangles fall (this serves as my mesh view, and it's surprisingly easy to work with), and I use the color map to make quick selections of different parts so that I can, for instance, just select the red channel and use that as a mask on a layer containing a wood texture for the gun's stock, and then select the green channel and use that as a mask on a layer containing metal for the gun's barrel.
<br /><br />Then there's all sorts of voodoo I work for refining the skin, like my tutorial on modwiki where I base the specularmap on the bumpmap to start with.
<br /><br />This is the workflow that has served me best thus far.  It's a combination of Goliath's early tutorial with lightwave, id's iddevnet way, and that uv unwrapping article I linked.
<br /><br />Working in earnest, with my modest modeling skills, I can have a near-final model in game in a few hours this way.  Albeit, with a rudimentary skin at that point.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p168242" date="Posted: Wed Jan 24, 2007 7:44 am "><author>Phobos</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks a lot.

<br /><br />first you should update your lightwave to 8.5 .. go to newtek.com and download the update ... 
<br /><br />after you updated lightwave you should add the "Flip UVs" button to the Modeler menu layout ... "<span style="font-weight: bold">Edit_&gt;Edit Menu Layout</span> in this window go to "<span style="font-weight: bold">Point Maps</span>" then select <span style="font-weight: bold">Flip UVs</span> and on the right side you can add it to a menu of your choice..
<br /><br />(you will find much more missing buttons in this window.. take a break and look for them!) 
<br /><br />and don't forget to "unweld" selected geometry if you flip parts of your uv map that are welded to other ! after flipping and repositioning you can hit "<span style="font-weight: bold">m</span>" to weld your points
<br /><br />a little flip example : (my little treasure box, for large pictures click on them)

It helped me limit space, but I'm still having issues getting a stubborn-unselectable corner into the uvmap &gt;.&lt;
<br /><br />And I have another question about high poly models. 
<br /><br />What are some different methods of getting those extremely smooth edges? I've tried a number of different things; sub patches, Knifing in tab, subdividing and triangulating, but I seem to get the same problem;
<br /><br />It'd be much easier to explain with a screenshot, so nevermind. And I think the knifing thing actually works, because after ctrl + d to freeze it, I have a beautiful curve, with no glitchyness or anything.

<br /><br />Otherwise you have to subdivide until the triangles are smaller than the pixels on the destination bump map.
<br /><br />Not that I ever did that... &gt;_&gt;
<br /><br />When you want hard edges to these smooth surfaces, create a new surface.  Smoothing doesn't occur across surface groups, so you'll have a hard edge there even if both surfaces have smoothing turned on and they are identical in every way.
<br /><br />Another way to get hard edges is to simply unweld points, but that's more cumbersome to work with.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p168485" date="Posted: Sat Jan 27, 2007 5:19 am "><author>Phobos</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">onu wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Otherwise you have to subdivide until the triangles are smaller than the pixels on the destination bump map.</div>

<br /><br />Totally!  I can't see your mesh in the UV view in that screenshot, but I'm assuming you might also have to scale that part of the model down.
<br /><br />As far as printscreening for the texture...
<br /><br />I assume you're making this model for Doom 3.  That's all I model for so my workflow is, as far as I know, the quickest way from nothing to in-game with lightwave.  So let me describe how I do it.  Not saying your way is wrong, I realize that's the way it's done quite often (or I guess instead of printscreen a modeler more experienced than us might make a quick render in layout using the uv map, but I don't know how to do that).
<br /><br />Step: The First
<br />Anyways, I create the High Poly mesh first.  In this mesh I assign up to six different surfaces on the model, based on how I plan to skin it later.  I have a Red, Green, and Blue surface with smoothing on (for organics), and Red, Green, and Blue surface with smoothing off (for flat surfaces and harsh angles).  There's no need to set the color to actually be red, green, and blue until you're ready to renderbump.
<br /><br />Step: The Second
<br />I create the Low Poly mesh second.  It's easy to do with the High Poly mesh in the background.  I usually just draw the triangles by hand, with the add points tool, and then selecting points and either making a triangle, quad, triangle fan, or triangle bridge.  It's not as fast as merging surfaces, or using qemLOSS2 or a lot of other ways, but it's precise and puts all the right triangles in all the right places.
<br /><br />Step: The Second Jr.
<br />I create a morph map called "flat" and proceed to unwrap my UV map here.  This method is described pretty well in that article I linked earlier.  When I'm done I use the Planar projection with manual settings.  You can usually leave the Center variables alone, but you'll probably want to modify the Size variables so that they're even (i.e. not X of 1.18 m and Y of 1.12, you'd want both to be 1.18 if you're projecting on the Z plane).
<br /><br />Step: His Highness the Third
<br />Let's review what we have.  <ol style="list-style-type: arabic-numbers"><li>A high poly mesh with a handful of different colored surfaces.</li><li>A low poly mesh with a surface that points to our material and a UV map.</li></ol>  So now we make sure the material we're pointing to has the renderbump command, with "-colormap" specified.  Go to Doom3 and renderbump &lt;path_to_low_poly.lwo&gt;.
<br /><br />This should produce a bump map and a color map in the path we specified in the shader.  In photoshop I use the bumpmap to discern where the triangles fall (this serves as my mesh view, and it's surprisingly easy to work with), and I use the color map to make quick selections of different parts so that I can, for instance, just select the red channel and use that as a mask on a layer containing a wood texture for the gun's stock, and then select the green channel and use that as a mask on a layer containing metal for the gun's barrel.
<br /><br />Then there's all sorts of voodoo I work for refining the skin, like my tutorial on modwiki where I base the specularmap on the bumpmap to start with.
<br /><br />This is the workflow that has served me best thus far.  It's a combination of Goliath's early tutorial with lightwave, id's iddevnet way, and that uv unwrapping article I linked.
<br /><br />Working in earnest, with my modest modeling skills, I can have a near-final model in game in a few hours this way.  Albeit, with a rudimentary skin at that point.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p168242" date="Posted: Wed Jan 24, 2007 7:44 am "><author>Phobos</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks a lot.

<br /><br />first you should update your lightwave to 8.5 .. go to newtek.com and download the update ... 
<br /><br />after you updated lightwave you should add the "Flip UVs" button to the Modeler menu layout ... "<span style="font-weight: bold">Edit_&gt;Edit Menu Layout</span> in this window go to "<span style="font-weight: bold">Point Maps</span>" then select <span style="font-weight: bold">Flip UVs</span> and on the right side you can add it to a menu of your choice..
<br /><br />(you will find much more missing buttons in this window.. take a break and look for them!) 
<br /><br />and don't forget to "unweld" selected geometry if you flip parts of your uv map that are welded to other ! after flipping and repositioning you can hit "<span style="font-weight: bold">m</span>" to weld your points
<br /><br />a little flip example : (my little treasure box, for large pictures click on them)

<br /><br />What are some different methods of getting those extremely smooth edges? I've tried a number of different things; sub patches, Knifing in tab, subdividing and triangulating, but I seem to get the same problem;
<br /><br />It'd be much easier to explain with a screenshot, so nevermind. And I think the knifing thing actually works, because after ctrl + d to freeze it, I have a beautiful curve, with no glitchyness or anything.

<br /><br />Otherwise you have to subdivide until the triangles are smaller than the pixels on the destination bump map.
<br /><br />Not that I ever did that... &gt;_&gt;
<br /><br />When you want hard edges to these smooth surfaces, create a new surface.  Smoothing doesn't occur across surface groups, so you'll have a hard edge there even if both surfaces have smoothing turned on and they are identical in every way.
<br /><br />Another way to get hard edges is to simply unweld points, but that's more cumbersome to work with.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p168485" date="Posted: Sat Jan 27, 2007 5:19 am "><author>Phobos</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">onu wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Otherwise you have to subdivide until the triangles are smaller than the pixels on the destination bump map.</div>

<br /><br />I wish I had some screenshots to help, but I left them at work  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205023120im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><br /><br />I'll do my best to explain. 
<br /><br />I made a surface (select polygons - 'q' ) out of a portion of the gun. I then proceeded to 'Make UV' etc. The selected area is cylindrical on the Z axis; I'm sure of it, so I know that's not the issue. 
<br /><br />I made my UV in Photoshop and saved it into my textures archive in lightwave (1024x1024 texture, jpeg, max quality). However, the second I opened it up via image editor and layed the image over the actual UV, and applied it live to the texture-view of the model, the image became extremely low-res, as in it-looks-like-its-100x100-but-stretched-to-1000x1000 low-res. Very pixelated. Also, on my image for the purpose of the model I put the text "Model Version 1.21.3" and although it is very foggy on the model, I can tell that it's .. backwards/inverted/in 'mirror code' (incoherent on the model). 
<br /><br />I fixed it by realizing that every square on my grid (after I turned the grid back on via display options) measured 3 feet, whereas my image was a normal 72px/". So, I resized my 12 foot shotgun into a reasonable realistic size and changed the grid. It is now about 3 feet long, each square on the grid being 1 foot. It seemed to help somewhat, but just on the verge of 'noticable difference.' 
<br /><br />The next thing that I did was hit 'd' again for display, and I cannot recall what tab it was under right now, but I believe it was layout. Not sure. Either way, the value was something very low, in the 60's or 70's button. I hit the '1024' button and whatever it did, it apparently worked. The image now appears to be the correct resolution on the model, and is quite clear. 
<br /><br />But the text is also quite clearly backwards &gt;.^
<br /><br />Any help on re-doing this, or making sure all my images fit the model would be great!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p168126" date="Posted: Tue Jan 23, 2007 3:07 pm "><author>onu</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I can't get it to turn out right with cylindrical projection either.

<br /><br />I assume you're making this model for Doom 3.  That's all I model for so my workflow is, as far as I know, the quickest way from nothing to in-game with lightwave.  So let me describe how I do it.  Not saying your way is wrong, I realize that's the way it's done quite often (or I guess instead of printscreen a modeler more experienced than us might make a quick render in layout using the uv map, but I don't know how to do that).
<br /><br />Step: The First
<br />Anyways, I create the High Poly mesh first.  In this mesh I assign up to six different surfaces on the model, based on how I plan to skin it later.  I have a Red, Green, and Blue surface with smoothing on (for organics), and Red, Green, and Blue surface with smoothing off (for flat surfaces and harsh angles).  There's no need to set the color to actually be red, green, and blue until you're ready to renderbump.
<br /><br />Step: The Second
<br />I create the Low Poly mesh second.  It's easy to do with the High Poly mesh in the background.  I usually just draw the triangles by hand, with the add points tool, and then selecting points and either making a triangle, quad, triangle fan, or triangle bridge.  It's not as fast as merging surfaces, or using qemLOSS2 or a lot of other ways, but it's precise and puts all the right triangles in all the right places.
<br /><br />Step: The Second Jr.
<br />I create a morph map called "flat" and proceed to unwrap my UV map here.  This method is described pretty well in that article I linked earlier.  When I'm done I use the Planar projection with manual settings.  You can usually leave the Center variables alone, but you'll probably want to modify the Size variables so that they're even (i.e. not X of 1.18 m and Y of 1.12, you'd want both to be 1.18 if you're projecting on the Z plane).
<br /><br />Step: His Highness the Third
<br />Let's review what we have.  <ol style="list-style-type: arabic-numbers"><li>A high poly mesh with a handful of different colored surfaces.</li><li>A low poly mesh with a surface that points to our material and a UV map.</li></ol>  So now we make sure the material we're pointing to has the renderbump command, with "-colormap" specified.  Go to Doom3 and renderbump &lt;path_to_low_poly.lwo&gt;.
<br /><br />This should produce a bump map and a color map in the path we specified in the shader.  In photoshop I use the bumpmap to discern where the triangles fall (this serves as my mesh view, and it's surprisingly easy to work with), and I use the color map to make quick selections of different parts so that I can, for instance, just select the red channel and use that as a mask on a layer containing a wood texture for the gun's stock, and then select the green channel and use that as a mask on a layer containing metal for the gun's barrel.
<br /><br />Then there's all sorts of voodoo I work for refining the skin, like my tutorial on modwiki where I base the specularmap on the bumpmap to start with.
<br /><br />This is the workflow that has served me best thus far.  It's a combination of Goliath's early tutorial with lightwave, id's iddevnet way, and that uv unwrapping article I linked.
<br /><br />Working in earnest, with my modest modeling skills, I can have a near-final model in game in a few hours this way.  Albeit, with a rudimentary skin at that point.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p168242" date="Posted: Wed Jan 24, 2007 7:44 am "><author>Phobos</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks a lot.

<br /><br />first you should update your lightwave to 8.5 .. go to newtek.com and download the update ... 
<br /><br />after you updated lightwave you should add the "Flip UVs" button to the Modeler menu layout ... "<span style="font-weight: bold">Edit_&gt;Edit Menu Layout</span> in this window go to "<span style="font-weight: bold">Point Maps</span>" then select <span style="font-weight: bold">Flip UVs</span> and on the right side you can add it to a menu of your choice..
<br /><br />(you will find much more missing buttons in this window.. take a break and look for them!) 
<br /><br />and don't forget to "unweld" selected geometry if you flip parts of your uv map that are welded to other ! after flipping and repositioning you can hit "<span style="font-weight: bold">m</span>" to weld your points
<br /><br />a little flip example : (my little treasure box, for large pictures click on them)

<br /><br />What are some different methods of getting those extremely smooth edges? I've tried a number of different things; sub patches, Knifing in tab, subdividing and triangulating, but I seem to get the same problem;
<br /><br />It'd be much easier to explain with a screenshot, so nevermind. And I think the knifing thing actually works, because after ctrl + d to freeze it, I have a beautiful curve, with no glitchyness or anything.

<br /><br />Otherwise you have to subdivide until the triangles are smaller than the pixels on the destination bump map.
<br /><br />Not that I ever did that... &gt;_&gt;
<br /><br />When you want hard edges to these smooth surfaces, create a new surface.  Smoothing doesn't occur across surface groups, so you'll have a hard edge there even if both surfaces have smoothing turned on and they are identical in every way.
<br /><br />Another way to get hard edges is to simply unweld points, but that's more cumbersome to work with.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p168485" date="Posted: Sat Jan 27, 2007 5:19 am "><author>Phobos</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">onu wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Otherwise you have to subdivide until the triangles are smaller than the pixels on the destination bump map.</div>

I then proceeded to 'Make UV' etc. The selected area is cylindrical on the Z axis; I'm sure of it, so I know that's not the issue. &#13;<br /><br />I made my UV in Photoshop and saved it into my textures archive in lightwave (1024x1024 texture, jpeg, max quality). However, the second I opened it up via image editor and layed the image over the actual UV, and applied it live to the texture-view of the model, the image became extremely low-res, as in it-looks-like-its-100x100-but-stretched-to-1000x1000 low-res. Very pixelated. Also, on my image for the purpose of the model I put the text "Model Version 1.21.3" and although it is very foggy on the model, I can tell that it's .. backwards/inverted/in 'mirror code' (incoherent on the model). &#13;<br /><br />I fixed it by realizing that every square on my grid (after I turned the grid back on via display options) measured 3 feet, whereas my image was a normal 72px/". So, I resized my 12 foot shotgun into a reasonable realistic size and changed the grid. It is now about 3 feet long, each square on the grid being 1 foot. It seemed to help somewhat, but just on the verge of 'noticable difference.' &#13;<br /><br />The next thing that I did was hit 'd' again for display, and I cannot recall what tab it was under right now, but I believe it was layout. Not sure. Either way, the value was something very low, in the 60's or 70's button. I hit the '1024' button and whatever it did, it apparently worked. The image now appears to be the correct resolution on the model, and is quite clear. &#13;<br /><br />But the text is also quite clearly backwards &gt;.^&#13;<br /><br />Any help on re-doing this, or making sure all my images fit the model would be great!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p168126" date="Posted: Tue Jan 23, 2007 3:07 pm "><author>onu</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I can't get it to turn out right with cylindrical projection either.&#13;<br /><br />If you don't want to spend any time on the UV Map, just flip the image.&#13;<br /><br />If you want to spend time on the UV Map, unwrap it manually and it will turn out just fine.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p168158" date="Posted: Tue Jan 23, 2007 10:56 pm "><author>Phobos</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Yeah.

The text isn't reversed on the model, the UV just isn't oriented in the fashion you want.  I seriously believe it's Lightwave's method of unwrapping.  Using Atlas might produce better results, since it can go piece by piece that way, but then the skin will have more seams than is required.&#13;<br /><br />This is why I would encourage you to start unwrapping manually.  It seems assinine for a cylinder, I know, but the more practice you get in the better off you'll be when you need to skin something more organic.&#13;<br /><br />I use the method described in "approach 2" here: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.newtek.com/products/lightwave/tutorials/uvmapping/character_UV/index.html" class="postlink">http://www.newtek.com/products/lightwave/tutorials/uvmapping/character_UV/index.html</a>&#13;<br /><br />This method gives you total control over where the seams will be generated (important with bump mapping), as well as how much detail specific parts of your model will be relative to other parts (on a shotgun barrel, for instance, your pixels might be better spent with details along the circumference of the cylinder, as opposed to along the length).&#13;<br /><br />And even if you ultimately go back to using projections for most of your UV maps, practice you get in with this method will help you be more bold when editing your UVs, and help you understand how inverted, rotated, skewed, and scaled triangles will affect your result.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p168186" date="Posted: Wed Jan 24, 2007 3:27 am "><author>Phobos</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Alright thanks man, I just scanned over it really quick.

I then proceeded to 'Make UV' etc. The selected area is cylindrical on the Z axis; I'm sure of it, so I know that's not the issue. &#13;<br /><br />I made my UV in Photoshop and saved it into my textures archive in lightwave (1024x1024 texture, jpeg, max quality). However, the second I opened it up via image editor and layed the image over the actual UV, and applied it live to the texture-view of the model, the image became extremely low-res, as in it-looks-like-its-100x100-but-stretched-to-1000x1000 low-res. Very pixelated. Also, on my image for the purpose of the model I put the text "Model Version 1.21.3" and although it is very foggy on the model, I can tell that it's .. backwards/inverted/in 'mirror code' (incoherent on the model). &#13;<br /><br />I fixed it by realizing that every square on my grid (after I turned the grid back on via display options) measured 3 feet, whereas my image was a normal 72px/". So, I resized my 12 foot shotgun into a reasonable realistic size and changed the grid. It is now about 3 feet long, each square on the grid being 1 foot. It seemed to help somewhat, but just on the verge of 'noticable difference.' &#13;<br /><br />The next thing that I did was hit 'd' again for display, and I cannot recall what tab it was under right now, but I believe it was layout. Not sure. Either way, the value was something very low, in the 60's or 70's button. I hit the '1024' button and whatever it did, it apparently worked. The image now appears to be the correct resolution on the model, and is quite clear. &#13;<br /><br />But the text is also quite clearly backwards &gt;.^&#13;<br /><br />Any help on re-doing this, or making sure all my images fit the model would be great!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p168126" date="Posted: Tue Jan 23, 2007 3:07 pm "><author>onu</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I can't get it to turn out right with cylindrical projection either.&#13;<br /><br />If you don't want to spend any time on the UV Map, just flip the image.&#13;<br /><br />If you want to spend time on the UV Map, unwrap it manually and it will turn out just fine.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p168158" date="Posted: Tue Jan 23, 2007 10:56 pm "><author>Phobos</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Yeah.

The text isn't reversed on the model, the UV just isn't oriented in the fashion you want.  I seriously believe it's Lightwave's method of unwrapping.  Using Atlas might produce better results, since it can go piece by piece that way, but then the skin will have more seams than is required.&#13;<br /><br />This is why I would encourage you to start unwrapping manually.  It seems assinine for a cylinder, I know, but the more practice you get in the better off you'll be when you need to skin something more organic.&#13;<br /><br />I use the method described in "approach 2" here: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.newtek.com/products/lightwave/tutorials/uvmapping/character_UV/index.html" class="postlink">http://www.newtek.com/products/lightwave/tutorials/uvmapping/character_UV/index.html</a>&#13;<br /><br />This method gives you total control over where the seams will be generated (important with bump mapping), as well as how much detail specific parts of your model will be relative to other parts (on a shotgun barrel, for instance, your pixels might be better spent with details along the circumference of the cylinder, as opposed to along the length).&#13;<br /><br />And even if you ultimately go back to using projections for most of your UV maps, practice you get in with this method will help you be more bold when editing your UVs, and help you understand how inverted, rotated, skewed, and scaled triangles will affect your result.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p168186" date="Posted: Wed Jan 24, 2007 3:27 am "><author>Phobos</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Alright thanks man, I just scanned over it really quick.

Just move it over, then PrintScreen and do the texture?</div>&#13;<br /><br />Totally!  I can't see your mesh in the UV view in that screenshot, but I'm assuming you might also have to scale that part of the model down.&#13;<br /><br />As far as printscreening for the texture...&#13;<br /><br />I assume you're making this model for Doom 3.  That's all I model for so my workflow is, as far as I know, the quickest way from nothing to in-game with lightwave.  So let me describe how I do it.  Not saying your way is wrong, I realize that's the way it's done quite often (or I guess instead of printscreen a modeler more experienced than us might make a quick render in layout using the uv map, but I don't know how to do that).&#13;<br /><br />Step: The First&#13;<br />Anyways, I create the High Poly mesh first.  In this mesh I assign up to six different surfaces on the model, based on how I plan to skin it later.  I have a Red, Green, and Blue surface with smoothing on (for organics), and Red, Green, and Blue surface with smoothing off (for flat surfaces and harsh angles).  There's no need to set the color to actually be red, green, and blue until you're ready to renderbump.&#13;<br /><br />Step: The Second&#13;<br />I create the Low Poly mesh second.  It's easy to do with the High Poly mesh in the background.  I usually just draw the triangles by hand, with the add points tool, and then selecting points and either making a triangle, quad, triangle fan, or triangle bridge.  It's not as fast as merging surfaces, or using qemLOSS2 or a lot of other ways, but it's precise and puts all the right triangles in all the right places.&#13;<br /><br />Step: The Second Jr.&#13;<br />I create a morph map called "flat" and proceed to unwrap my UV map here.  This method is described pretty well in that article I linked earlier.  When I'm done I use the Planar projection with manual settings.  You can usually leave the Center variables alone, but you'll probably want to modify the Size variables so that they're even (i.e. not X of 1.18 m and Y of 1.12, you'd want both to be 1.18 if you're projecting on the Z plane).&#13;<br /><br />Step: His Highness the Third&#13;<br />Let's review what we have.  <ol style="list-style-type: arabic-numbers"><li>A high poly mesh with a handful of different colored surfaces.</li><li>A low poly mesh with a surface that points to our material and a UV map.</li></ol>  So now we make sure the material we're pointing to has the renderbump command, with "-colormap" specified.  Go to Doom3 and renderbump &lt;path_to_low_poly.lwo&gt;.&#13;<br /><br />This should produce a bump map and a color map in the path we specified in the shader.  In photoshop I use the bumpmap to discern where the triangles fall (this serves as my mesh view, and it's surprisingly easy to work with), and I use the color map to make quick selections of different parts so that I can, for instance, just select the red channel and use that as a mask on a layer containing a wood texture for the gun's stock, and then select the green channel and use that as a mask on a layer containing metal for the gun's barrel.&#13;<br /><br />Then there's all sorts of voodoo I work for refining the skin, like my tutorial on modwiki where I base the specularmap on the bumpmap to start with.&#13;<br /><br />This is the workflow that has served me best thus far.  It's a combination of Goliath's early tutorial with lightwave, id's iddevnet way, and that uv unwrapping article I linked.&#13;<br /><br />Working in earnest, with my modest modeling skills, I can have a near-final model in game in a few hours this way.  Albeit, with a rudimentary skin at that point.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p168242" date="Posted: Wed Jan 24, 2007 7:44 am "><author>Phobos</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks a lot.

<br /><br />I wish I had some screenshots to help, but I left them at work  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><br /><br />I'll do my best to explain. 
<br /><br />I made a surface (select polygons - 'q' ) out of a portion of the gun. I then proceeded to 'Make UV' etc. The selected area is cylindrical on the Z axis; I'm sure of it, so I know that's not the issue. 
<br /><br />I made my UV in Photoshop and saved it into my textures archive in lightwave (1024x1024 texture, jpeg, max quality). However, the second I opened it up via image editor and layed the image over the actual UV, and applied it live to the texture-view of the model, the image became extremely low-res, as in it-looks-like-its-100x100-but-stretched-to-1000x1000 low-res. Very pixelated. Also, on my image for the purpose of the model I put the text "Model Version 1.21.3" and although it is very foggy on the model, I can tell that it's .. backwards/inverted/in 'mirror code' (incoherent on the model). 
<br /><br />I fixed it by realizing that every square on my grid (after I turned the grid back on via display options) measured 3 feet, whereas my image was a normal 72px/". So, I resized my 12 foot shotgun into a reasonable realistic size and changed the grid. It is now about 3 feet long, each square on the grid being 1 foot. It seemed to help somewhat, but just on the verge of 'noticable difference.' 
<br /><br />The next thing that I did was hit 'd' again for display, and I cannot recall what tab it was under right now, but I believe it was layout. Not sure. Either way, the value was something very low, in the 60's or 70's button. I hit the '1024' button and whatever it did, it apparently worked. The image now appears to be the correct resolution on the model, and is quite clear. 
<br /><br />But the text is also quite clearly backwards &gt;.^
<br /><br />Any help on re-doing this, or making sure all my images fit the model would be great!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p168126" date="Posted: Tue Jan 23, 2007 3:07 pm "><author>onu</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I can't get it to turn out right with cylindrical projection either.

<br /><br />This is using the measure tool to literally show the length of the model (it's not that big)

<br /><br />And apparently after doing all that, hitting the 1024 button here:

<br /><br />The pixelated-problem is no longer an issue - the image looks about right. But it's still backwards &gt;.^
<br /><br />I have the text backwards on the actual image file v

<br /><br />But that doesn't help much if I have to flip every image before I attatch the uv. 
<br /><br /><br />This is ofcourse only my first model in lightwave, so I don't care so much about quality so much as I want to get it done and know how to do it. But I looked at a few of BNA!'s tips/mini tutorial things and found that I could actually create a reasonable 'high' poly model out of that shabby 104 poly's that I had:

<br /><br />I end up unwrapping everything manually, even simple objects, because it's the best way (that I know of) to get everything right with a minimal number of seams.
<br /><br />The orientation matters.  The text isn't reversed on the model, the UV just isn't oriented in the fashion you want.  I seriously believe it's Lightwave's method of unwrapping.  Using Atlas might produce better results, since it can go piece by piece that way, but then the skin will have more seams than is required.
<br /><br />This is why I would encourage you to start unwrapping manually.  It seems assinine for a cylinder, I know, but the more practice you get in the better off you'll be when you need to skin something more organic.
<br /><br />I use the method described in "approach 2" here: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.newtek.com/products/lightwave/tutorials/uvmapping/character_UV/index.html" class="postlink">http://www.newtek.com/products/lightwave/tutorials/uvmapping/character_UV/index.html</a>
<br /><br />This method gives you total control over where the seams will be generated (important with bump mapping), as well as how much detail specific parts of your model will be relative to other parts (on a shotgun barrel, for instance, your pixels might be better spent with details along the circumference of the cylinder, as opposed to along the length).
<br /><br />And even if you ultimately go back to using projections for most of your UV maps, practice you get in with this method will help you be more bold when editing your UVs, and help you understand how inverted, rotated, skewed, and scaled triangles will affect your result.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p168186" date="Posted: Wed Jan 24, 2007 3:27 am "><author>Phobos</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Alright thanks man, I just scanned over it really quick. I'll have to go over it more in detail tomarrow when I'm working on the model. 
<br /><br />All that I did for that particular UV map was unwrap the 'black' part in the first picture. You can't really see that in the uvmap window [upper left] because I just made an entire square flat texture to put over it. I originally had a clean-cut texture, but I was having issues with a white line that kept showing up where the uv 'coordinates' were 'off' the plaine. 
<br /><br />For example, what should I do when I'm looking at the unwrapped model in the uv window, and not all of it fits into the black square? Just move it over, then PrintScreen and do the texture?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p168202" date="Posted: Wed Jan 24, 2007 4:13 am "><author>onu</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Phobos wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">...what should I do when I'm looking at the unwrapped model in the uv window, and not all of it fits into the black square? Just move it over, then PrintScreen and do the texture?</div>
<br /><br />Totally!  I can't see your mesh in the UV view in that screenshot, but I'm assuming you might also have to scale that part of the model down.
<br /><br />As far as printscreening for the texture...
<br /><br />I assume you're making this model for Doom 3.  That's all I model for so my workflow is, as far as I know, the quickest way from nothing to in-game with lightwave.  So let me describe how I do it.  Not saying your way is wrong, I realize that's the way it's done quite often (or I guess instead of printscreen a modeler more experienced than us might make a quick render in layout using the uv map, but I don't know how to do that).
<br /><br />Step: The First
<br />Anyways, I create the High Poly mesh first.  In this mesh I assign up to six different surfaces on the model, based on how I plan to skin it later.  I have a Red, Green, and Blue surface with smoothing on (for organics), and Red, Green, and Blue surface with smoothing off (for flat surfaces and harsh angles).  There's no need to set the color to actually be red, green, and blue until you're ready to renderbump.
<br /><br />Step: The Second
<br />I create the Low Poly mesh second.  It's easy to do with the High Poly mesh in the background.  I usually just draw the triangles by hand, with the add points tool, and then selecting points and either making a triangle, quad, triangle fan, or triangle bridge.  It's not as fast as merging surfaces, or using qemLOSS2 or a lot of other ways, but it's precise and puts all the right triangles in all the right places.
<br /><br />Step: The Second Jr.
<br />I create a morph map called "flat" and proceed to unwrap my UV map here.  This method is described pretty well in that article I linked earlier.  When I'm done I use the Planar projection with manual settings.  You can usually leave the Center variables alone, but you'll probably want to modify the Size variables so that they're even (i.e. not X of 1.18 m and Y of 1.12, you'd want both to be 1.18 if you're projecting on the Z plane).
<br /><br />Step: His Highness the Third
<br />Let's review what we have.  <ol style="list-style-type: arabic-numbers"><li>A high poly mesh with a handful of different colored surfaces.</li><li>A low poly mesh with a surface that points to our material and a UV map.</li></ol>  So now we make sure the material we're pointing to has the renderbump command, with "-colormap" specified.  Go to Doom3 and renderbump &lt;path_to_low_poly.lwo&gt;.
<br /><br />This should produce a bump map and a color map in the path we specified in the shader.  In photoshop I use the bumpmap to discern where the triangles fall (this serves as my mesh view, and it's surprisingly easy to work with), and I use the color map to make quick selections of different parts so that I can, for instance, just select the red channel and use that as a mask on a layer containing a wood texture for the gun's stock, and then select the green channel and use that as a mask on a layer containing metal for the gun's barrel.
<br /><br />Then there's all sorts of voodoo I work for refining the skin, like my tutorial on modwiki where I base the specularmap on the bumpmap to start with.
<br /><br />This is the workflow that has served me best thus far.  It's a combination of Goliath's early tutorial with lightwave, id's iddevnet way, and that uv unwrapping article I linked.
<br /><br />Working in earnest, with my modest modeling skills, I can have a near-final model in game in a few hours this way.  Albeit, with a rudimentary skin at that point.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p168242" date="Posted: Wed Jan 24, 2007 7:44 am "><author>Phobos</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks a lot.

<br /><br />first you should update your lightwave to 8.5 .. go to newtek.com and download the update ... 
<br /><br />after you updated lightwave you should add the "Flip UVs" button to the Modeler menu layout ... "<span style="font-weight: bold">Edit_&gt;Edit Menu Layout</span> in this window go to "<span style="font-weight: bold">Point Maps</span>" then select <span style="font-weight: bold">Flip UVs</span> and on the right side you can add it to a menu of your choice..
<br /><br />(you will find much more missing buttons in this window.. take a break and look for them!) 
<br /><br />and don't forget to "unweld" selected geometry if you flip parts of your uv map that are welded to other ! after flipping and repositioning you can hit "<span style="font-weight: bold">m</span>" to weld your points

I wish I had some screenshots to help, but I left them at work  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0"/><br/><br/>
I'll do my best to explain. &#13;
<br/><br/>
I made a surface (select polygons - 'q' ) out of a portion of the gun. I then proceeded to 'Make UV' etc. The selected area is cylindrical on the Z axis; I'm sure of it, so I know that's not the issue. &#13;
<br/><br/>
I made my UV in Photoshop and saved it into my textures archive in lightwave (1024x1024 texture, jpeg, max quality). However, the second I opened it up via image editor and layed the image over the actual UV, and applied it live to the texture-view of the model, the image became extremely low-res, as in it-looks-like-its-100x100-but-stretched-to-1000x1000 low-res. Very pixelated. Also, on my image for the purpose of the model I put the text "Model Version 1.21.3" and although it is very foggy on the model, I can tell that it's .. backwards/inverted/in 'mirror code' (incoherent on the model). &#13;
<br/><br/>
I fixed it by realizing that every square on my grid (after I turned the grid back on via display options) measured 3 feet, whereas my image was a normal 72px/". So, I resized my 12 foot shotgun into a reasonable realistic size and changed the grid. It is now about 3 feet long, each square on the grid being 1 foot. It seemed to help somewhat, but just on the verge of 'noticable difference.' &#13;
<br/><br/>
The next thing that I did was hit 'd' again for display, and I cannot recall what tab it was under right now, but I believe it was layout. Not sure. Either way, the value was something very low, in the 60's or 70's button. I hit the '1024' button and whatever it did, it apparently worked. The image now appears to be the correct resolution on the model, and is quite clear. &#13;
<br/><br/>
But the text is also quite clearly backwards &gt;.^&#13;
<br/><br/>
Any help on re-doing this, or making sure all my images fit the model would be great!<br/>_________________<br/>.Mods.C++.Animation.Graphics.Doom.WebDesign.&#13;

But that doesn't help much if I have to flip every image before I attatch the uv. &#13;

<br/><br/>
I end up unwrapping everything manually, even simple objects, because it's the best way (that I know of) to get everything right with a minimal number of seams.&#13;
<br/><br/>
The orientation matters.  The text isn't reversed on the model, the UV just isn't oriented in the fashion you want.  I seriously believe it's Lightwave's method of unwrapping.  Using Atlas might produce better results, since it can go piece by piece that way, but then the skin will have more seams than is required.&#13;
<br/><br/>
This is why I would encourage you to start unwrapping manually.  It seems assinine for a cylinder, I know, but the more practice you get in the better off you'll be when you need to skin something more organic.&#13;
<br/><br/>
I use the method described in "approach 2" here: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.newtek.com/products/lightwave/tutorials/uvmapping/character_UV/index.html" target="_blank" class="postlink">http://www.newtek.com/products/lightwave/tutorials/uvmapping/character_UV/index.html</a>&#13;
<br/><br/>
This method gives you total control over where the seams will be generated (important with bump mapping), as well as how much detail specific parts of your model will be relative to other parts (on a shotgun barrel, for instance, your pixels might be better spent with details along the circumference of the cylinder, as opposed to along the length).&#13;
<br/><br/>
And even if you ultimately go back to using projections for most of your UV maps, practice you get in with this method will help you be more bold when editing your UVs, and help you understand how inverted, rotated, skewed, and scaled triangles will affect your result.</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

All that I did for that particular UV map was unwrap the 'black' part in the first picture. You can't really see that in the uvmap window [upper left] because I just made an entire square flat texture to put over it. I originally had a clean-cut texture, but I was having issues with a white line that kept showing up where the uv 'coordinates' were 'off' the plaine. &#13;
<br/><br/>
For example, what should I do when I'm looking at the unwrapped model in the uv window, and not all of it fits into the black square? Just move it over, then PrintScreen and do the texture?<br/>_________________<br/>.Mods.C++.Animation.Graphics.Doom.WebDesign.&#13;

<br/><br/>
Totally!  I can't see your mesh in the UV view in that screenshot, but I'm assuming you might also have to scale that part of the model down.&#13;
<br/><br/>
As far as printscreening for the texture...&#13;
<br/><br/>
I assume you're making this model for Doom 3.  That's all I model for so my workflow is, as far as I know, the quickest way from nothing to in-game with lightwave.  So let me describe how I do it.  Not saying your way is wrong, I realize that's the way it's done quite often (or I guess instead of printscreen a modeler more experienced than us might make a quick render in layout using the uv map, but I don't know how to do that).&#13;
<br/><br/>
Step: The First&#13;
<br/>
Anyways, I create the High Poly mesh first.  In this mesh I assign up to six different surfaces on the model, based on how I plan to skin it later.  I have a Red, Green, and Blue surface with smoothing on (for organics), and Red, Green, and Blue surface with smoothing off (for flat surfaces and harsh angles).  There's no need to set the color to actually be red, green, and blue until you're ready to renderbump.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Step: The Second&#13;
<br/>
I create the Low Poly mesh second.  It's easy to do with the High Poly mesh in the background.  I usually just draw the triangles by hand, with the add points tool, and then selecting points and either making a triangle, quad, triangle fan, or triangle bridge.  It's not as fast as merging surfaces, or using qemLOSS2 or a lot of other ways, but it's precise and puts all the right triangles in all the right places.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Step: The Second Jr.&#13;
<br/>
I create a morph map called "flat" and proceed to unwrap my UV map here.  This method is described pretty well in that article I linked earlier.  When I'm done I use the Planar projection with manual settings.  You can usually leave the Center variables alone, but you'll probably want to modify the Size variables so that they're even (i.e. not X of 1.18 m and Y of 1.12, you'd want both to be 1.18 if you're projecting on the Z plane).&#13;
<br/><br/>
Step: His Highness the Third&#13;
<br/>
Let's review what we have.  <ol type="1"><li>A high poly mesh with a handful of different colored surfaces.</li><li>A low poly mesh with a surface that points to our material and a UV map.</li></ol>  So now we make sure the material we're pointing to has the renderbump command, with "-colormap" specified.  Go to Doom3 and renderbump &lt;path_to_low_poly.lwo&gt;.&#13;
<br/><br/>
This should produce a bump map and a color map in the path we specified in the shader.  In photoshop I use the bumpmap to discern where the triangles fall (this serves as my mesh view, and it's surprisingly easy to work with), and I use the color map to make quick selections of different parts so that I can, for instance, just select the red channel and use that as a mask on a layer containing a wood texture for the gun's stock, and then select the green channel and use that as a mask on a layer containing metal for the gun's barrel.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Then there's all sorts of voodoo I work for refining the skin, like my tutorial on modwiki where I base the specularmap on the bumpmap to start with.&#13;
<br/><br/>
This is the workflow that has served me best thus far.  It's a combination of Goliath's early tutorial with lightwave, id's iddevnet way, and that uv unwrapping article I linked.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Working in earnest, with my modest modeling skills, I can have a near-final model in game in a few hours this way.  Albeit, with a rudimentary skin at that point.</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

<br/><br/>
first you should update your lightwave to 8.5 .. go to newtek.com and download the update ... &#13;
<br/><br/>
after you updated lightwave you should add the "Flip UVs" button to the Modeler menu layout ... "<span style="font-weight: bold">Edit_&gt;Edit Menu Layout</span> in this window go to "<span style="font-weight: bold">Point Maps</span>" then select <span style="font-weight: bold">Flip UVs</span> and on the right side you can add it to a menu of your choice..&#13;
<br/><br/>
(you will find much more missing buttons in this window.. take a break and look for them!) &#13;
<br/><br/>
and don't forget to "unweld" selected geometry if you flip parts of your uv map that are welded to other ! after flipping and repositioning you can hit "<span style="font-weight: bold">m</span>" to weld your points&#13;
<br/><br/>
a little flip example : (my little treasure box, for large pictures click on them)&#13;

<br /><br />The orientation matters.  The text isn't reversed on the model, the UV just isn't oriented in the fashion you want.  I seriously believe it's Lightwave's method of unwrapping.

<br /><br />This method gives you total control over where the seams will be generated (important with bump mapping), as well as how much detail specific parts of your model will be relative to other parts (on a shotgun barrel, for instance, your pixels might be better spent with details along the circumference of the cylinder, as opposed to along the length).
<br /><br />And even if you ultimately go back to using projections for most of your UV maps, practice you get in with this method will help you be more bold when editing your UVs, and help you understand how inverted, rotated, skewed, and scaled triangles will affect your result.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p168186" date="Posted: Wed Jan 24, 2007 3:27 am "><author>Phobos</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Alright thanks man, I just scanned over it really quick.

You can't really see that in the uvmap window [upper left] because I just made an entire square flat texture to put over it.

Just move it over, then PrintScreen and do the texture?</div>
<br /><br />Totally!  I can't see your mesh in the UV view in that screenshot, but I'm assuming you might also have to scale that part of the model down.
<br /><br />As far as printscreening for the texture...
<br /><br />I assume you're making this model for Doom 3.  That's all I model for so my workflow is, as far as I know, the quickest way from nothing to in-game with lightwave.  So let me describe how I do it.  Not saying your way is wrong, I realize that's the way it's done quite often (or I guess instead of printscreen a modeler more experienced than us might make a quick render in layout using the uv map, but I don't know how to do that).
<br /><br />Step: The First
<br />Anyways, I create the High Poly mesh first.  In this mesh I assign up to six different surfaces on the model, based on how I plan to skin it later.  I have a Red, Green, and Blue surface with smoothing on (for organics), and Red, Green, and Blue surface with smoothing off (for flat surfaces and harsh angles).  There's no need to set the color to actually be red, green, and blue until you're ready to renderbump.
<br /><br />Step: The Second
<br />I create the Low Poly mesh second.  It's easy to do with the High Poly mesh in the background.  I usually just draw the triangles by hand, with the add points tool, and then selecting points and either making a triangle, quad, triangle fan, or triangle bridge.  It's not as fast as merging surfaces, or using qemLOSS2 or a lot of other ways, but it's precise and puts all the right triangles in all the right places.
<br /><br />Step: The Second Jr.
<br />I create a morph map called "flat" and proceed to unwrap my UV map here.  This method is described pretty well in that article I linked earlier.  When I'm done I use the Planar projection with manual settings.  You can usually leave the Center variables alone, but you'll probably want to modify the Size variables so that they're even (i.e. not X of 1.18 m and Y of 1.12, you'd want both to be 1.18 if you're projecting on the Z plane).
<br /><br />Step: His Highness the Third
<br />Let's review what we have.  <ol style="list-style-type: arabic-numbers"><li>A high poly mesh with a handful of different colored surfaces.</li><li>A low poly mesh with a surface that points to our material and a UV map.</li></ol>  So now we make sure the material we're pointing to has the renderbump command, with "-colormap" specified.  Go to Doom3 and renderbump &lt;path_to_low_poly.lwo&gt;.
<br /><br />This should produce a bump map and a color map in the path we specified in the shader.  In photoshop I use the bumpmap to discern where the triangles fall (this serves as my mesh view, and it's surprisingly easy to work with), and I use the color map to make quick selections of different parts so that I can, for instance, just select the red channel and use that as a mask on a layer containing a wood texture for the gun's stock, and then select the green channel and use that as a mask on a layer containing metal for the gun's barrel.
<br /><br />Then there's all sorts of voodoo I work for refining the skin, like my tutorial on modwiki where I base the specularmap on the bumpmap to start with.
<br /><br />This is the workflow that has served me best thus far.  It's a combination of Goliath's early tutorial with lightwave, id's iddevnet way, and that uv unwrapping article I linked.
<br /><br />Working in earnest, with my modest modeling skills, I can have a near-final model in game in a few hours this way.  Albeit, with a rudimentary skin at that point.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p168242" date="Posted: Wed Jan 24, 2007 7:44 am "><author>Phobos</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks a lot.

<br /><br />first you should update your lightwave to 8.5 .. go to newtek.com and download the update ... 
<br /><br />after you updated lightwave you should add the "Flip UVs" button to the Modeler menu layout ... "<span style="font-weight: bold">Edit_&gt;Edit Menu Layout</span> in this window go to "<span style="font-weight: bold">Point Maps</span>" then select <span style="font-weight: bold">Flip UVs</span> and on the right side you can add it to a menu of your choice..
<br /><br />(you will find much more missing buttons in this window.. take a break and look for them!) 
<br /><br />and don't forget to "unweld" selected geometry if you flip parts of your uv map that are welded to other ! after flipping and repositioning you can hit "<span style="font-weight: bold">m</span>" to weld your points
<br /><br />a little flip example : (my little treasure box, for large pictures click on them)

<br /><br />Not that I ever did that... &gt;_&gt;
<br /><br />When you want hard edges to these smooth surfaces, create a new surface.  Smoothing doesn't occur across surface groups, so you'll have a hard edge there even if both surfaces have smoothing turned on and they are identical in every way.
<br /><br />Another way to get hard edges is to simply unweld points, but that's more cumbersome to work with.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p168485" date="Posted: Sat Jan 27, 2007 5:19 am "><author>Phobos</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">onu wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Otherwise you have to subdivide until the triangles are smaller than the pixels on the destination bump map.</div>

<br/><br/>
I wish I had some screenshots to help, but I left them at work  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0"/><br/><br/>
I'll do my best to explain. &#13;
<br/><br/>
I made a surface (select polygons - 'q' ) out of a portion of the gun. I then proceeded to 'Make UV' etc. The selected area is cylindrical on the Z axis; I'm sure of it, so I know that's not the issue. &#13;
<br/><br/>
I made my UV in Photoshop and saved it into my textures archive in lightwave (1024x1024 texture, jpeg, max quality). However, the second I opened it up via image editor and layed the image over the actual UV, and applied it live to the texture-view of the model, the image became extremely low-res, as in it-looks-like-its-100x100-but-stretched-to-1000x1000 low-res. Very pixelated. Also, on my image for the purpose of the model I put the text "Model Version 1.21.3" and although it is very foggy on the model, I can tell that it's .. backwards/inverted/in 'mirror code' (incoherent on the model). &#13;
<br/><br/>
I fixed it by realizing that every square on my grid (after I turned the grid back on via display options) measured 3 feet, whereas my image was a normal 72px/". So, I resized my 12 foot shotgun into a reasonable realistic size and changed the grid. It is now about 3 feet long, each square on the grid being 1 foot. It seemed to help somewhat, but just on the verge of 'noticable difference.' &#13;
<br/><br/>
The next thing that I did was hit 'd' again for display, and I cannot recall what tab it was under right now, but I believe it was layout. Not sure. Either way, the value was something very low, in the 60's or 70's button. I hit the '1024' button and whatever it did, it apparently worked. The image now appears to be the correct resolution on the model, and is quite clear. &#13;
<br/><br/>
But the text is also quite clearly backwards &gt;.^&#13;
<br/><br/>
Any help on re-doing this, or making sure all my images fit the model would be great!<br/>_________________<br/>.Mods.C++.Animation.Graphics.Doom.WebDesign.&#13;

But that doesn't help much if I have to flip every image before I attatch the uv. &#13;

<br/><br/>
Totally!  I can't see your mesh in the UV view in that screenshot, but I'm assuming you might also have to scale that part of the model down.&#13;
<br/><br/>
As far as printscreening for the texture...&#13;
<br/><br/>
I assume you're making this model for Doom 3.  That's all I model for so my workflow is, as far as I know, the quickest way from nothing to in-game with lightwave.  So let me describe how I do it.  Not saying your way is wrong, I realize that's the way it's done quite often (or I guess instead of printscreen a modeler more experienced than us might make a quick render in layout using the uv map, but I don't know how to do that).&#13;
<br/><br/>
Step: The First&#13;
<br/>
Anyways, I create the High Poly mesh first.  In this mesh I assign up to six different surfaces on the model, based on how I plan to skin it later.  I have a Red, Green, and Blue surface with smoothing on (for organics), and Red, Green, and Blue surface with smoothing off (for flat surfaces and harsh angles).  There's no need to set the color to actually be red, green, and blue until you're ready to renderbump.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Step: The Second&#13;
<br/>
I create the Low Poly mesh second.  It's easy to do with the High Poly mesh in the background.  I usually just draw the triangles by hand, with the add points tool, and then selecting points and either making a triangle, quad, triangle fan, or triangle bridge.  It's not as fast as merging surfaces, or using qemLOSS2 or a lot of other ways, but it's precise and puts all the right triangles in all the right places.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Step: The Second Jr.&#13;
<br/>
I create a morph map called "flat" and proceed to unwrap my UV map here.  This method is described pretty well in that article I linked earlier.  When I'm done I use the Planar projection with manual settings.  You can usually leave the Center variables alone, but you'll probably want to modify the Size variables so that they're even (i.e. not X of 1.18 m and Y of 1.12, you'd want both to be 1.18 if you're projecting on the Z plane).&#13;
<br/><br/>
Step: His Highness the Third&#13;
<br/>
Let's review what we have.  <ol type="1"><li>A high poly mesh with a handful of different colored surfaces.</li><li>A low poly mesh with a surface that points to our material and a UV map.</li></ol>  So now we make sure the material we're pointing to has the renderbump command, with "-colormap" specified.  Go to Doom3 and renderbump &lt;path_to_low_poly.lwo&gt;.&#13;
<br/><br/>
This should produce a bump map and a color map in the path we specified in the shader.  In photoshop I use the bumpmap to discern where the triangles fall (this serves as my mesh view, and it's surprisingly easy to work with), and I use the color map to make quick selections of different parts so that I can, for instance, just select the red channel and use that as a mask on a layer containing a wood texture for the gun's stock, and then select the green channel and use that as a mask on a layer containing metal for the gun's barrel.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Then there's all sorts of voodoo I work for refining the skin, like my tutorial on modwiki where I base the specularmap on the bumpmap to start with.&#13;
<br/><br/>
This is the workflow that has served me best thus far.  It's a combination of Goliath's early tutorial with lightwave, id's iddevnet way, and that uv unwrapping article I linked.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Working in earnest, with my modest modeling skills, I can have a near-final model in game in a few hours this way.  Albeit, with a rudimentary skin at that point.</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

<br/><br/>
first you should update your lightwave to 8.5 .. go to newtek.com and download the update ... &#13;
<br/><br/>
after you updated lightwave you should add the "Flip UVs" button to the Modeler menu layout ... "<span style="font-weight: bold">Edit_&gt;Edit Menu Layout</span> in this window go to "<span style="font-weight: bold">Point Maps</span>" then select <span style="font-weight: bold">Flip UVs</span> and on the right side you can add it to a menu of your choice..&#13;
<br/><br/>
(you will find much more missing buttons in this window.. take a break and look for them!) &#13;
<br/><br/>
and don't forget to "unweld" selected geometry if you flip parts of your uv map that are welded to other ! after flipping and repositioning you can hit "<span style="font-weight: bold">m</span>" to weld your points&#13;
<br/><br/>

<br /><br />I wish I had some screenshots to help, but I left them at work  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><br /><br />I'll do my best to explain. 
<br /><br />I made a surface (select polygons - 'q' ) out of a portion of the gun. I then proceeded to 'Make UV' etc. The selected area is cylindrical on the Z axis; I'm sure of it, so I know that's not the issue. 
<br /><br />I made my UV in Photoshop and saved it into my textures archive in lightwave (1024x1024 texture, jpeg, max quality). However, the second I opened it up via image editor and layed the image over the actual UV, and applied it live to the texture-view of the model, the image became extremely low-res, as in it-looks-like-its-100x100-but-stretched-to-1000x1000 low-res. Very pixelated. Also, on my image for the purpose of the model I put the text "Model Version 1.21.3" and although it is very foggy on the model, I can tell that it's .. backwards/inverted/in 'mirror code' (incoherent on the model). 
<br /><br />I fixed it by realizing that every square on my grid (after I turned the grid back on via display options) measured 3 feet, whereas my image was a normal 72px/". So, I resized my 12 foot shotgun into a reasonable realistic size and changed the grid. It is now about 3 feet long, each square on the grid being 1 foot. It seemed to help somewhat, but just on the verge of 'noticable difference.' 
<br /><br />The next thing that I did was hit 'd' again for display, and I cannot recall what tab it was under right now, but I believe it was layout. Not sure. Either way, the value was something very low, in the 60's or 70's button. I hit the '1024' button and whatever it did, it apparently worked. The image now appears to be the correct resolution on the model, and is quite clear. 
<br /><br />But the text is also quite clearly backwards &gt;.^
<br /><br />Any help on re-doing this, or making sure all my images fit the model would be great!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p168126" date="Posted: Tue Jan 23, 2007 3:07 pm "><author>onu</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I can't get it to turn out right with cylindrical projection either.

<br /><br />This is using the measure tool to literally show the length of the model (it's not that big)
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img187.imageshack.us/my.php?image=414490831ke.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img187.imageshack.us/img187/505/414490831ke.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />And apparently after doing all that, hitting the 1024 button here:
<br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img250.imageshack.us/my.php?image=displayoptions0dz.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img250.imageshack.us/img250/749/displayoptions0dz.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />The pixelated-problem is no longer an issue - the image looks about right. But it's still backwards &gt;.^
<br /><br />I have the text backwards on the actual image file v

<br /><br />But that doesn't help much if I have to flip every image before I attatch the uv. 
<br /><br /><br />This is ofcourse only my first model in lightwave, so I don't care so much about quality so much as I want to get it done and know how to do it. But I looked at a few of BNA!'s tips/mini tutorial things and found that I could actually create a reasonable 'high' poly model out of that shabby 104 poly's that I had:

<br /><br />I end up unwrapping everything manually, even simple objects, because it's the best way (that I know of) to get everything right with a minimal number of seams.
<br /><br />The orientation matters.  The text isn't reversed on the model, the UV just isn't oriented in the fashion you want.  I seriously believe it's Lightwave's method of unwrapping.  Using Atlas might produce better results, since it can go piece by piece that way, but then the skin will have more seams than is required.
<br /><br />This is why I would encourage you to start unwrapping manually.  It seems assinine for a cylinder, I know, but the more practice you get in the better off you'll be when you need to skin something more organic.
<br /><br />I use the method described in "approach 2" here: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.newtek.com/products/lightwave/tutorials/uvmapping/character_UV/index.html" class="postlink">http://www.newtek.com/products/lightwave/tutorials/uvmapping/character_UV/index.html</a>

<br /><br />I wish I had some screenshots to help, but I left them at work  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><br /><br />I'll do my best to explain. 
<br /><br />I made a surface (select polygons - 'q' ) out of a portion of the gun. I then proceeded to 'Make UV' etc. The selected area is cylindrical on the Z axis; I'm sure of it, so I know that's not the issue. 
<br /><br />I made my UV in Photoshop and saved it into my textures archive in lightwave (1024x1024 texture, jpeg, max quality). However, the second I opened it up via image editor and layed the image over the actual UV, and applied it live to the texture-view of the model, the image became extremely low-res, as in it-looks-like-its-100x100-but-stretched-to-1000x1000 low-res. Very pixelated. Also, on my image for the purpose of the model I put the text "Model Version 1.21.3" and although it is very foggy on the model, I can tell that it's .. backwards/inverted/in 'mirror code' (incoherent on the model). 
<br /><br />I fixed it by realizing that every square on my grid (after I turned the grid back on via display options) measured 3 feet, whereas my image was a normal 72px/". So, I resized my 12 foot shotgun into a reasonable realistic size and changed the grid. It is now about 3 feet long, each square on the grid being 1 foot. It seemed to help somewhat, but just on the verge of 'noticable difference.' 
<br /><br />The next thing that I did was hit 'd' again for display, and I cannot recall what tab it was under right now, but I believe it was layout. Not sure. Either way, the value was something very low, in the 60's or 70's button. I hit the '1024' button and whatever it did, it apparently worked. The image now appears to be the correct resolution on the model, and is quite clear. 
<br /><br />But the text is also quite clearly backwards &gt;.^
<br /><br />Any help on re-doing this, or making sure all my images fit the model would be great!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p168126" date="Posted: Tue Jan 23, 2007 3:07 pm "><author>onu</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I can't get it to turn out right with cylindrical projection either.

Well I got some screenshots today.. if it helps. This was my result after flipping the text in photoshop:

<br /><br />This is using the measure tool to literally show the length of the model (it's not that big)
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img187.imageshack.us/my.php?image=414490831ke.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img187.imageshack.us/img187/505/414490831ke.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />And apparently after doing all that, hitting the 1024 button here:
<br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img250.imageshack.us/my.php?image=displayoptions0dz.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://img250.imageshack.us/img250/749/displayoptions0dz.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />The pixelated-problem is no longer an issue - the image looks about right. But it's still backwards &gt;.^
<br /><br />I have the text backwards on the actual image file v

<br /><br />But that doesn't help much if I have to flip every image before I attatch the uv. 
<br /><br /><br />This is ofcourse only my first model in lightwave, so I don't care so much about quality so much as I want to get it done and know how to do it. But I looked at a few of BNA!'s tips/mini tutorial things and found that I could actually create a reasonable 'high' poly model out of that shabby 104 poly's that I had:

<br /><br />I end up unwrapping everything manually, even simple objects, because it's the best way (that I know of) to get everything right with a minimal number of seams.
<br /><br />The orientation matters.  The text isn't reversed on the model, the UV just isn't oriented in the fashion you want.  I seriously believe it's Lightwave's method of unwrapping.  Using Atlas might produce better results, since it can go piece by piece that way, but then the skin will have more seams than is required.
<br /><br />This is why I would encourage you to start unwrapping manually.  It seems assinine for a cylinder, I know, but the more practice you get in the better off you'll be when you need to skin something more organic.
<br /><br />I use the method described in "approach 2" here: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.newtek.com/products/lightwave/tutorials/uvmapping/character_UV/index.html" class="postlink">http://www.newtek.com/products/lightwave/tutorials/uvmapping/character_UV/index.html</a>
<br /><br />This method gives you total control over where the seams will be generated (important with bump mapping), as well as how much detail specific parts of your model will be relative to other parts (on a shotgun barrel, for instance, your pixels might be better spent with details along the circumference of the cylinder, as opposed to along the length).
<br /><br />And even if you ultimately go back to using projections for most of your UV maps, practice you get in with this method will help you be more bold when editing your UVs, and help you understand how inverted, rotated, skewed, and scaled triangles will affect your result.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p168186" date="Posted: Wed Jan 24, 2007 3:27 am "><author>Phobos</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Alright thanks man, I just scanned over it really quick. I'll have to go over it more in detail tomarrow when I'm working on the model. 
<br /><br />All that I did for that particular UV map was unwrap the 'black' part in the first picture. You can't really see that in the uvmap window [upper left] because I just made an entire square flat texture to put over it. I originally had a clean-cut texture, but I was having issues with a white line that kept showing up where the uv 'coordinates' were 'off' the plaine. 
<br /><br />For example, what should I do when I'm looking at the unwrapped model in the uv window, and not all of it fits into the black square? Just move it over, then PrintScreen and do the texture?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p168202" date="Posted: Wed Jan 24, 2007 4:13 am "><author>onu</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Phobos wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">...what should I do when I'm looking at the unwrapped model in the uv window, and not all of it fits into the black square? Just move it over, then PrintScreen and do the texture?</div>
<br /><br />Totally!  I can't see your mesh in the UV view in that screenshot, but I'm assuming you might also have to scale that part of the model down.
<br /><br />As far as printscreening for the texture...
<br /><br />I assume you're making this model for Doom 3.  That's all I model for so my workflow is, as far as I know, the quickest way from nothing to in-game with lightwave.  So let me describe how I do it.  Not saying your way is wrong, I realize that's the way it's done quite often (or I guess instead of printscreen a modeler more experienced than us might make a quick render in layout using the uv map, but I don't know how to do that).
<br /><br />Step: The First
<br />Anyways, I create the High Poly mesh first.  In this mesh I assign up to six different surfaces on the model, based on how I plan to skin it later.  I have a Red, Green, and Blue surface with smoothing on (for organics), and Red, Green, and Blue surface with smoothing off (for flat surfaces and harsh angles).  There's no need to set the color to actually be red, green, and blue until you're ready to renderbump.
<br /><br />Step: The Second
<br />I create the Low Poly mesh second.  It's easy to do with the High Poly mesh in the background.  I usually just draw the triangles by hand, with the add points tool, and then selecting points and either making a triangle, quad, triangle fan, or triangle bridge.  It's not as fast as merging surfaces, or using qemLOSS2 or a lot of other ways, but it's precise and puts all the right triangles in all the right places.
<br /><br />Step: The Second Jr.
<br />I create a morph map called "flat" and proceed to unwrap my UV map here.  This method is described pretty well in that article I linked earlier.  When I'm done I use the Planar projection with manual settings.  You can usually leave the Center variables alone, but you'll probably want to modify the Size variables so that they're even (i.e. not X of 1.18 m and Y of 1.12, you'd want both to be 1.18 if you're projecting on the Z plane).
<br /><br />Step: His Highness the Third
<br />Let's review what we have.  <ol style="list-style-type: arabic-numbers"><li>A high poly mesh with a handful of different colored surfaces.</li><li>A low poly mesh with a surface that points to our material and a UV map.</li></ol>  So now we make sure the material we're pointing to has the renderbump command, with "-colormap" specified.  Go to Doom3 and renderbump &lt;path_to_low_poly.lwo&gt;.
<br /><br />This should produce a bump map and a color map in the path we specified in the shader.  In photoshop I use the bumpmap to discern where the triangles fall (this serves as my mesh view, and it's surprisingly easy to work with), and I use the color map to make quick selections of different parts so that I can, for instance, just select the red channel and use that as a mask on a layer containing a wood texture for the gun's stock, and then select the green channel and use that as a mask on a layer containing metal for the gun's barrel.
<br /><br />Then there's all sorts of voodoo I work for refining the skin, like my tutorial on modwiki where I base the specularmap on the bumpmap to start with.
<br /><br />This is the workflow that has served me best thus far.  It's a combination of Goliath's early tutorial with lightwave, id's iddevnet way, and that uv unwrapping article I linked.
<br /><br />Working in earnest, with my modest modeling skills, I can have a near-final model in game in a few hours this way.  Albeit, with a rudimentary skin at that point.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p168242" date="Posted: Wed Jan 24, 2007 7:44 am "><author>Phobos</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks a lot.

The text isn't reversed on the model, the UV just isn't oriented in the fashion you want.  I seriously believe it's Lightwave's method of unwrapping.  Using Atlas might produce better results, since it can go piece by piece that way, but then the skin will have more seams than is required.&#13;<br /><br />This is why I would encourage you to start unwrapping manually.  It seems assinine for a cylinder, I know, but the more practice you get in the better off you'll be when you need to skin something more organic.&#13;<br /><br />I use the method described in "approach 2" here: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.newtek.com/products/lightwave/tutorials/uvmapping/character_UV/index.html" class="postlink">http://www.newtek.com/products/lightwave/tutorials/uvmapping/character_UV/index.html</a>&#13;<br /><br />This method gives you total control over where the seams will be generated (important with bump mapping), as well as how much detail specific parts of your model will be relative to other parts (on a shotgun barrel, for instance, your pixels might be better spent with details along the circumference of the cylinder, as opposed to along the length).&#13;<br /><br />And even if you ultimately go back to using projections for most of your UV maps, practice you get in with this method will help you be more bold when editing your UVs, and help you understand how inverted, rotated, skewed, and scaled triangles will affect your result.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p168186" date="Posted: Wed Jan 24, 2007 3:27 am "><author>Phobos</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Alright thanks man, I just scanned over it really quick.

You can't really see that in the uvmap window [upper left] because I just made an entire square flat texture to put over it.

Just move it over, then PrintScreen and do the texture?</div>&#13;<br /><br />Totally!  I can't see your mesh in the UV view in that screenshot, but I'm assuming you might also have to scale that part of the model down.&#13;<br /><br />As far as printscreening for the texture...&#13;<br /><br />I assume you're making this model for Doom 3.  That's all I model for so my workflow is, as far as I know, the quickest way from nothing to in-game with lightwave.  So let me describe how I do it.  Not saying your way is wrong, I realize that's the way it's done quite often (or I guess instead of printscreen a modeler more experienced than us might make a quick render in layout using the uv map, but I don't know how to do that).&#13;<br /><br />Step: The First&#13;<br />Anyways, I create the High Poly mesh first.  In this mesh I assign up to six different surfaces on the model, based on how I plan to skin it later.  I have a Red, Green, and Blue surface with smoothing on (for organics), and Red, Green, and Blue surface with smoothing off (for flat surfaces and harsh angles).  There's no need to set the color to actually be red, green, and blue until you're ready to renderbump.&#13;<br /><br />Step: The Second&#13;<br />I create the Low Poly mesh second.  It's easy to do with the High Poly mesh in the background.  I usually just draw the triangles by hand, with the add points tool, and then selecting points and either making a triangle, quad, triangle fan, or triangle bridge.  It's not as fast as merging surfaces, or using qemLOSS2 or a lot of other ways, but it's precise and puts all the right triangles in all the right places.&#13;<br /><br />Step: The Second Jr.&#13;<br />I create a morph map called "flat" and proceed to unwrap my UV map here.  This method is described pretty well in that article I linked earlier.  When I'm done I use the Planar projection with manual settings.  You can usually leave the Center variables alone, but you'll probably want to modify the Size variables so that they're even (i.e. not X of 1.18 m and Y of 1.12, you'd want both to be 1.18 if you're projecting on the Z plane).&#13;<br /><br />Step: His Highness the Third&#13;<br />Let's review what we have.  <ol style="list-style-type: arabic-numbers"><li>A high poly mesh with a handful of different colored surfaces.</li><li>A low poly mesh with a surface that points to our material and a UV map.</li></ol>  So now we make sure the material we're pointing to has the renderbump command, with "-colormap" specified.  Go to Doom3 and renderbump &lt;path_to_low_poly.lwo&gt;.&#13;<br /><br />This should produce a bump map and a color map in the path we specified in the shader.  In photoshop I use the bumpmap to discern where the triangles fall (this serves as my mesh view, and it's surprisingly easy to work with), and I use the color map to make quick selections of different parts so that I can, for instance, just select the red channel and use that as a mask on a layer containing a wood texture for the gun's stock, and then select the green channel and use that as a mask on a layer containing metal for the gun's barrel.&#13;<br /><br />Then there's all sorts of voodoo I work for refining the skin, like my tutorial on modwiki where I base the specularmap on the bumpmap to start with.&#13;<br /><br />This is the workflow that has served me best thus far.  It's a combination of Goliath's early tutorial with lightwave, id's iddevnet way, and that uv unwrapping article I linked.&#13;<br /><br />Working in earnest, with my modest modeling skills, I can have a near-final model in game in a few hours this way.  Albeit, with a rudimentary skin at that point.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p168242" date="Posted: Wed Jan 24, 2007 7:44 am "><author>Phobos</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks a lot.

The text isn't reversed on the model, the UV just isn't oriented in the fashion you want.  I seriously believe it's Lightwave's method of unwrapping.  Using Atlas might produce better results, since it can go piece by piece that way, but then the skin will have more seams than is required.&#13;<br /><br />This is why I would encourage you to start unwrapping manually.  It seems assinine for a cylinder, I know, but the more practice you get in the better off you'll be when you need to skin something more organic.&#13;<br /><br />I use the method described in "approach 2" here: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.newtek.com/products/lightwave/tutorials/uvmapping/character_UV/index.html" class="postlink">http://www.newtek.com/products/lightwave/tutorials/uvmapping/character_UV/index.html</a>&#13;<br /><br />This method gives you total control over where the seams will be generated (important with bump mapping), as well as how much detail specific parts of your model will be relative to other parts (on a shotgun barrel, for instance, your pixels might be better spent with details along the circumference of the cylinder, as opposed to along the length).&#13;<br /><br />And even if you ultimately go back to using projections for most of your UV maps, practice you get in with this method will help you be more bold when editing your UVs, and help you understand how inverted, rotated, skewed, and scaled triangles will affect your result.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p168186" date="Posted: Wed Jan 24, 2007 3:27 am "><author>Phobos</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Alright thanks man, I just scanned over it really quick.

You can't really see that in the uvmap window [upper left] because I just made an entire square flat texture to put over it.

Just move it over, then PrintScreen and do the texture?</div>&#13;<br /><br />Totally!  I can't see your mesh in the UV view in that screenshot, but I'm assuming you might also have to scale that part of the model down.&#13;<br /><br />As far as printscreening for the texture...&#13;<br /><br />I assume you're making this model for Doom 3.  That's all I model for so my workflow is, as far as I know, the quickest way from nothing to in-game with lightwave.  So let me describe how I do it.  Not saying your way is wrong, I realize that's the way it's done quite often (or I guess instead of printscreen a modeler more experienced than us might make a quick render in layout using the uv map, but I don't know how to do that).&#13;<br /><br />Step: The First&#13;<br />Anyways, I create the High Poly mesh first.  In this mesh I assign up to six different surfaces on the model, based on how I plan to skin it later.  I have a Red, Green, and Blue surface with smoothing on (for organics), and Red, Green, and Blue surface with smoothing off (for flat surfaces and harsh angles).  There's no need to set the color to actually be red, green, and blue until you're ready to renderbump.&#13;<br /><br />Step: The Second&#13;<br />I create the Low Poly mesh second.  It's easy to do with the High Poly mesh in the background.  I usually just draw the triangles by hand, with the add points tool, and then selecting points and either making a triangle, quad, triangle fan, or triangle bridge.  It's not as fast as merging surfaces, or using qemLOSS2 or a lot of other ways, but it's precise and puts all the right triangles in all the right places.&#13;<br /><br />Step: The Second Jr.&#13;<br />I create a morph map called "flat" and proceed to unwrap my UV map here.  This method is described pretty well in that article I linked earlier.  When I'm done I use the Planar projection with manual settings.  You can usually leave the Center variables alone, but you'll probably want to modify the Size variables so that they're even (i.e. not X of 1.18 m and Y of 1.12, you'd want both to be 1.18 if you're projecting on the Z plane).&#13;<br /><br />Step: His Highness the Third&#13;<br />Let's review what we have.  <ol style="list-style-type: arabic-numbers"><li>A high poly mesh with a handful of different colored surfaces.</li><li>A low poly mesh with a surface that points to our material and a UV map.</li></ol>  So now we make sure the material we're pointing to has the renderbump command, with "-colormap" specified.  Go to Doom3 and renderbump &lt;path_to_low_poly.lwo&gt;.&#13;<br /><br />This should produce a bump map and a color map in the path we specified in the shader.  In photoshop I use the bumpmap to discern where the triangles fall (this serves as my mesh view, and it's surprisingly easy to work with), and I use the color map to make quick selections of different parts so that I can, for instance, just select the red channel and use that as a mask on a layer containing a wood texture for the gun's stock, and then select the green channel and use that as a mask on a layer containing metal for the gun's barrel.&#13;<br /><br />Then there's all sorts of voodoo I work for refining the skin, like my tutorial on modwiki where I base the specularmap on the bumpmap to start with.&#13;<br /><br />This is the workflow that has served me best thus far.  It's a combination of Goliath's early tutorial with lightwave, id's iddevnet way, and that uv unwrapping article I linked.&#13;<br /><br />Working in earnest, with my modest modeling skills, I can have a near-final model in game in a few hours this way.  Albeit, with a rudimentary skin at that point.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p168242" date="Posted: Wed Jan 24, 2007 7:44 am "><author>Phobos</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks a lot.

I then proceeded to 'Make UV' etc. The selected area is cylindrical on the Z axis; I'm sure of it, so I know that's not the issue. &#13;<br /><br />I made my UV in Photoshop and saved it into my textures archive in lightwave (1024x1024 texture, jpeg, max quality). However, the second I opened it up via image editor and layed the image over the actual UV, and applied it live to the texture-view of the model, the image became extremely low-res, as in it-looks-like-its-100x100-but-stretched-to-1000x1000 low-res. Very pixelated. Also, on my image for the purpose of the model I put the text "Model Version 1.21.3" and although it is very foggy on the model, I can tell that it's .. backwards/inverted/in 'mirror code' (incoherent on the model). &#13;<br /><br />I fixed it by realizing that every square on my grid (after I turned the grid back on via display options) measured 3 feet, whereas my image was a normal 72px/". So, I resized my 12 foot shotgun into a reasonable realistic size and changed the grid. It is now about 3 feet long, each square on the grid being 1 foot. It seemed to help somewhat, but just on the verge of 'noticable difference.' &#13;<br /><br />The next thing that I did was hit 'd' again for display, and I cannot recall what tab it was under right now, but I believe it was layout. Not sure. Either way, the value was something very low, in the 60's or 70's button. I hit the '1024' button and whatever it did, it apparently worked.

The text isn't reversed on the model, the UV just isn't oriented in the fashion you want.  I seriously believe it's Lightwave's method of unwrapping.  Using Atlas might produce better results, since it can go piece by piece that way, but then the skin will have more seams than is required.&#13;<br /><br />This is why I would encourage you to start unwrapping manually.  It seems assinine for a cylinder, I know, but the more practice you get in the better off you'll be when you need to skin something more organic.&#13;<br /><br />I use the method described in "approach 2" here: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.newtek.com/products/lightwave/tutorials/uvmapping/character_UV/index.html" class="postlink">http://www.newtek.com/products/lightwave/tutorials/uvmapping/character_UV/index.html</a>&#13;<br /><br />This method gives you total control over where the seams will be generated (important with bump mapping), as well as how much detail specific parts of your model will be relative to other parts (on a shotgun barrel, for instance, your pixels might be better spent with details along the circumference of the cylinder, as opposed to along the length).&#13;<br /><br />And even if you ultimately go back to using projections for most of your UV maps, practice you get in with this method will help you be more bold when editing your UVs, and help you understand how inverted, rotated, skewed, and scaled triangles will affect your result.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p168186" date="Posted: Wed Jan 24, 2007 3:27 am "><author>Phobos</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Alright thanks man, I just scanned over it really quick.

Just move it over, then PrintScreen and do the texture?</div>&#13;<br /><br />Totally!  I can't see your mesh in the UV view in that screenshot, but I'm assuming you might also have to scale that part of the model down.&#13;<br /><br />As far as printscreening for the texture...&#13;<br /><br />I assume you're making this model for Doom 3.  That's all I model for so my workflow is, as far as I know, the quickest way from nothing to in-game with lightwave.  So let me describe how I do it.  Not saying your way is wrong, I realize that's the way it's done quite often (or I guess instead of printscreen a modeler more experienced than us might make a quick render in layout using the uv map, but I don't know how to do that).&#13;<br /><br />Step: The First&#13;<br />Anyways, I create the High Poly mesh first.  In this mesh I assign up to six different surfaces on the model, based on how I plan to skin it later.  I have a Red, Green, and Blue surface with smoothing on (for organics), and Red, Green, and Blue surface with smoothing off (for flat surfaces and harsh angles).  There's no need to set the color to actually be red, green, and blue until you're ready to renderbump.&#13;<br /><br />Step: The Second&#13;<br />I create the Low Poly mesh second.  It's easy to do with the High Poly mesh in the background.  I usually just draw the triangles by hand, with the add points tool, and then selecting points and either making a triangle, quad, triangle fan, or triangle bridge.  It's not as fast as merging surfaces, or using qemLOSS2 or a lot of other ways, but it's precise and puts all the right triangles in all the right places.&#13;<br /><br />Step: The Second Jr.&#13;<br />I create a morph map called "flat" and proceed to unwrap my UV map here.  This method is described pretty well in that article I linked earlier.  When I'm done I use the Planar projection with manual settings.  You can usually leave the Center variables alone, but you'll probably want to modify the Size variables so that they're even (i.e. not X of 1.18 m and Y of 1.12, you'd want both to be 1.18 if you're projecting on the Z plane).&#13;<br /><br />Step: His Highness the Third&#13;<br />Let's review what we have.  <ol style="list-style-type: arabic-numbers"><li>A high poly mesh with a handful of different colored surfaces.</li><li>A low poly mesh with a surface that points to our material and a UV map.</li></ol>  So now we make sure the material we're pointing to has the renderbump command, with "-colormap" specified.  Go to Doom3 and renderbump &lt;path_to_low_poly.lwo&gt;.&#13;<br /><br />This should produce a bump map and a color map in the path we specified in the shader.  In photoshop I use the bumpmap to discern where the triangles fall (this serves as my mesh view, and it's surprisingly easy to work with), and I use the color map to make quick selections of different parts so that I can, for instance, just select the red channel and use that as a mask on a layer containing a wood texture for the gun's stock, and then select the green channel and use that as a mask on a layer containing metal for the gun's barrel.&#13;<br /><br />Then there's all sorts of voodoo I work for refining the skin, like my tutorial on modwiki where I base the specularmap on the bumpmap to start with.&#13;<br /><br />This is the workflow that has served me best thus far.  It's a combination of Goliath's early tutorial with lightwave, id's iddevnet way, and that uv unwrapping article I linked.&#13;<br /><br />Working in earnest, with my modest modeling skills, I can have a near-final model in game in a few hours this way.  Albeit, with a rudimentary skin at that point.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p168242" date="Posted: Wed Jan 24, 2007 7:44 am "><author>Phobos</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks a lot.

<br /><br />I wish I had some screenshots to help, but I left them at work  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><br /><br />I'll do my best to explain. 
<br /><br />I made a surface (select polygons - 'q' ) out of a portion of the gun. I then proceeded to 'Make UV' etc. The selected area is cylindrical on the Z axis; I'm sure of it, so I know that's not the issue. 
<br /><br />I made my UV in Photoshop and saved it into my textures archive in lightwave (1024x1024 texture, jpeg, max quality). However, the second I opened it up via image editor and layed the image over the actual UV, and applied it live to the texture-view of the model, the image became extremely low-res, as in it-looks-like-its-100x100-but-stretched-to-1000x1000 low-res. Very pixelated. Also, on my image for the purpose of the model I put the text "Model Version 1.21.3" and although it is very foggy on the model, I can tell that it's .. backwards/inverted/in 'mirror code' (incoherent on the model). 
<br /><br />I fixed it by realizing that every square on my grid (after I turned the grid back on via display options) measured 3 feet, whereas my image was a normal 72px/". So, I resized my 12 foot shotgun into a reasonable realistic size and changed the grid. It is now about 3 feet long, each square on the grid being 1 foot. It seemed to help somewhat, but just on the verge of 'noticable difference.' 
<br /><br />The next thing that I did was hit 'd' again for display, and I cannot recall what tab it was under right now, but I believe it was layout. Not sure. Either way, the value was something very low, in the 60's or 70's button. I hit the '1024' button and whatever it did, it apparently worked. The image now appears to be the correct resolution on the model, and is quite clear. 
<br /><br />But the text is also quite clearly backwards &gt;.^
<br /><br />Any help on re-doing this, or making sure all my images fit the model would be great!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p168126" date="Posted: Tue Jan 23, 2007 3:07 pm "><author>onu</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I can't get it to turn out right with cylindrical projection either.

<br /><br />This method gives you total control over where the seams will be generated (important with bump mapping), as well as how much detail specific parts of your model will be relative to other parts (on a shotgun barrel, for instance, your pixels might be better spent with details along the circumference of the cylinder, as opposed to along the length).
<br /><br />And even if you ultimately go back to using projections for most of your UV maps, practice you get in with this method will help you be more bold when editing your UVs, and help you understand how inverted, rotated, skewed, and scaled triangles will affect your result.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p168186" date="Posted: Wed Jan 24, 2007 3:27 am "><author>Phobos</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Alright thanks man, I just scanned over it really quick.

<br /><br />Totally!  I can't see your mesh in the UV view in that screenshot, but I'm assuming you might also have to scale that part of the model down.
<br /><br />As far as printscreening for the texture...
<br /><br />I assume you're making this model for Doom 3.  That's all I model for so my workflow is, as far as I know, the quickest way from nothing to in-game with lightwave.  So let me describe how I do it.  Not saying your way is wrong, I realize that's the way it's done quite often (or I guess instead of printscreen a modeler more experienced than us might make a quick render in layout using the uv map, but I don't know how to do that).
<br /><br />Step: The First
<br />Anyways, I create the High Poly mesh first.  In this mesh I assign up to six different surfaces on the model, based on how I plan to skin it later.  I have a Red, Green, and Blue surface with smoothing on (for organics), and Red, Green, and Blue surface with smoothing off (for flat surfaces and harsh angles).  There's no need to set the color to actually be red, green, and blue until you're ready to renderbump.
<br /><br />Step: The Second
<br />I create the Low Poly mesh second.  It's easy to do with the High Poly mesh in the background.  I usually just draw the triangles by hand, with the add points tool, and then selecting points and either making a triangle, quad, triangle fan, or triangle bridge.  It's not as fast as merging surfaces, or using qemLOSS2 or a lot of other ways, but it's precise and puts all the right triangles in all the right places.
<br /><br />Step: The Second Jr.
<br />I create a morph map called "flat" and proceed to unwrap my UV map here.  This method is described pretty well in that article I linked earlier.  When I'm done I use the Planar projection with manual settings.  You can usually leave the Center variables alone, but you'll probably want to modify the Size variables so that they're even (i.e. not X of 1.18 m and Y of 1.12, you'd want both to be 1.18 if you're projecting on the Z plane).
<br /><br />Step: His Highness the Third
<br />Let's review what we have.  <ol style="list-style-type: arabic-numbers"><li>A high poly mesh with a handful of different colored surfaces.</li><li>A low poly mesh with a surface that points to our material and a UV map.</li></ol>  So now we make sure the material we're pointing to has the renderbump command, with "-colormap" specified.  Go to Doom3 and renderbump &lt;path_to_low_poly.lwo&gt;.
<br /><br />This should produce a bump map and a color map in the path we specified in the shader.  In photoshop I use the bumpmap to discern where the triangles fall (this serves as my mesh view, and it's surprisingly easy to work with), and I use the color map to make quick selections of different parts so that I can, for instance, just select the red channel and use that as a mask on a layer containing a wood texture for the gun's stock, and then select the green channel and use that as a mask on a layer containing metal for the gun's barrel.
<br /><br />Then there's all sorts of voodoo I work for refining the skin, like my tutorial on modwiki where I base the specularmap on the bumpmap to start with.
<br /><br />This is the workflow that has served me best thus far.  It's a combination of Goliath's early tutorial with lightwave, id's iddevnet way, and that uv unwrapping article I linked.
<br /><br />Working in earnest, with my modest modeling skills, I can have a near-final model in game in a few hours this way.  Albeit, with a rudimentary skin at that point.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p168242" date="Posted: Wed Jan 24, 2007 7:44 am "><author>Phobos</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks a lot.

<br /><br />first you should update your lightwave to 8.5 .. go to newtek.com and download the update ... 
<br /><br />after you updated lightwave you should add the "Flip UVs" button to the Modeler menu layout ... "<span style="font-weight: bold">Edit_&gt;Edit Menu Layout</span> in this window go to "<span style="font-weight: bold">Point Maps</span>" then select <span style="font-weight: bold">Flip UVs</span> and on the right side you can add it to a menu of your choice..
<br /><br />(you will find much more missing buttons in this window.. take a break and look for them!) 
<br /><br />and don't forget to "unweld" selected geometry if you flip parts of your uv map that are welded to other ! after flipping and repositioning you can hit "<span style="font-weight: bold">m</span>" to weld your points

<br /><br />Not that I ever did that... &gt;_&gt;
<br /><br />When you want hard edges to these smooth surfaces, create a new surface.  Smoothing doesn't occur across surface groups, so you'll have a hard edge there even if both surfaces have smoothing turned on and they are identical in every way.
<br /><br />Another way to get hard edges is to simply unweld points, but that's more cumbersome to work with.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p168485" date="Posted: Sat Jan 27, 2007 5:19 am "><author>Phobos</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">onu wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Otherwise you have to subdivide until the triangles are smaller than the pixels on the destination bump map.</div>

<br/><br/>
I wish I had some screenshots to help, but I left them at work  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0"/><br/><br/>
I'll do my best to explain. &#13;
<br/><br/>
I made a surface (select polygons - 'q' ) out of a portion of the gun. I then proceeded to 'Make UV' etc. The selected area is cylindrical on the Z axis; I'm sure of it, so I know that's not the issue. &#13;
<br/><br/>
I made my UV in Photoshop and saved it into my textures archive in lightwave (1024x1024 texture, jpeg, max quality). However, the second I opened it up via image editor and layed the image over the actual UV, and applied it live to the texture-view of the model, the image became extremely low-res, as in it-looks-like-its-100x100-but-stretched-to-1000x1000 low-res. Very pixelated. Also, on my image for the purpose of the model I put the text "Model Version 1.21.3" and although it is very foggy on the model, I can tell that it's .. backwards/inverted/in 'mirror code' (incoherent on the model). &#13;
<br/><br/>
I fixed it by realizing that every square on my grid (after I turned the grid back on via display options) measured 3 feet, whereas my image was a normal 72px/". So, I resized my 12 foot shotgun into a reasonable realistic size and changed the grid. It is now about 3 feet long, each square on the grid being 1 foot. It seemed to help somewhat, but just on the verge of 'noticable difference.' &#13;
<br/><br/>
The next thing that I did was hit 'd' again for display, and I cannot recall what tab it was under right now, but I believe it was layout. Not sure. Either way, the value was something very low, in the 60's or 70's button. I hit the '1024' button and whatever it did, it apparently worked. The image now appears to be the correct resolution on the model, and is quite clear. &#13;
<br/><br/>
But the text is also quite clearly backwards &gt;.^&#13;
<br/><br/>
Any help on re-doing this, or making sure all my images fit the model would be great!<br/>_________________<br/>.Mods.C++.Animation.Graphics.Doom.WebDesign.&#13;

<br/><br/>
The pixelated-problem is no longer an issue - the image looks about right. But it's still backwards &gt;.^&#13;
<br/><br/>
I have the text backwards on the actual image file v&#13;

<br/><br/>
But that doesn't help much if I have to flip every image before I attatch the uv. &#13;

This is ofcourse only my first model in lightwave, so I don't care so much about quality so much as I want to get it done and know how to do it.

<br/><br/>
I end up unwrapping everything manually, even simple objects, because it's the best way (that I know of) to get everything right with a minimal number of seams.&#13;
<br/><br/>
The orientation matters.  The text isn't reversed on the model, the UV just isn't oriented in the fashion you want.  I seriously believe it's Lightwave's method of unwrapping.  Using Atlas might produce better results, since it can go piece by piece that way, but then the skin will have more seams than is required.&#13;
<br/><br/>
This is why I would encourage you to start unwrapping manually.  It seems assinine for a cylinder, I know, but the more practice you get in the better off you'll be when you need to skin something more organic.&#13;
<br/><br/>
I use the method described in "approach 2" here: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.newtek.com/products/lightwave/tutorials/uvmapping/character_UV/index.html" target="_blank" class="postlink">http://www.newtek.com/products/lightwave/tutorials/uvmapping/character_UV/index.html</a>&#13;
<br/><br/>
This method gives you total control over where the seams will be generated (important with bump mapping), as well as how much detail specific parts of your model will be relative to other parts (on a shotgun barrel, for instance, your pixels might be better spent with details along the circumference of the cylinder, as opposed to along the length).&#13;
<br/><br/>
And even if you ultimately go back to using projections for most of your UV maps, practice you get in with this method will help you be more bold when editing your UVs, and help you understand how inverted, rotated, skewed, and scaled triangles will affect your result.</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

<br/><br/>
Totally!  I can't see your mesh in the UV view in that screenshot, but I'm assuming you might also have to scale that part of the model down.&#13;
<br/><br/>
As far as printscreening for the texture...&#13;
<br/><br/>
I assume you're making this model for Doom 3.  That's all I model for so my workflow is, as far as I know, the quickest way from nothing to in-game with lightwave.  So let me describe how I do it.  Not saying your way is wrong, I realize that's the way it's done quite often (or I guess instead of printscreen a modeler more experienced than us might make a quick render in layout using the uv map, but I don't know how to do that).&#13;
<br/><br/>
Step: The First&#13;
<br/>
Anyways, I create the High Poly mesh first.  In this mesh I assign up to six different surfaces on the model, based on how I plan to skin it later.  I have a Red, Green, and Blue surface with smoothing on (for organics), and Red, Green, and Blue surface with smoothing off (for flat surfaces and harsh angles).  There's no need to set the color to actually be red, green, and blue until you're ready to renderbump.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Step: The Second&#13;
<br/>
I create the Low Poly mesh second.  It's easy to do with the High Poly mesh in the background.  I usually just draw the triangles by hand, with the add points tool, and then selecting points and either making a triangle, quad, triangle fan, or triangle bridge.  It's not as fast as merging surfaces, or using qemLOSS2 or a lot of other ways, but it's precise and puts all the right triangles in all the right places.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Step: The Second Jr.&#13;
<br/>
I create a morph map called "flat" and proceed to unwrap my UV map here.  This method is described pretty well in that article I linked earlier.  When I'm done I use the Planar projection with manual settings.  You can usually leave the Center variables alone, but you'll probably want to modify the Size variables so that they're even (i.e. not X of 1.18 m and Y of 1.12, you'd want both to be 1.18 if you're projecting on the Z plane).&#13;
<br/><br/>
Step: His Highness the Third&#13;
<br/>
Let's review what we have.  <ol type="1"><li>A high poly mesh with a handful of different colored surfaces.</li><li>A low poly mesh with a surface that points to our material and a UV map.</li></ol>  So now we make sure the material we're pointing to has the renderbump command, with "-colormap" specified.  Go to Doom3 and renderbump &lt;path_to_low_poly.lwo&gt;.&#13;
<br/><br/>
This should produce a bump map and a color map in the path we specified in the shader.  In photoshop I use the bumpmap to discern where the triangles fall (this serves as my mesh view, and it's surprisingly easy to work with), and I use the color map to make quick selections of different parts so that I can, for instance, just select the red channel and use that as a mask on a layer containing a wood texture for the gun's stock, and then select the green channel and use that as a mask on a layer containing metal for the gun's barrel.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Then there's all sorts of voodoo I work for refining the skin, like my tutorial on modwiki where I base the specularmap on the bumpmap to start with.&#13;
<br/><br/>
This is the workflow that has served me best thus far.  It's a combination of Goliath's early tutorial with lightwave, id's iddevnet way, and that uv unwrapping article I linked.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Working in earnest, with my modest modeling skills, I can have a near-final model in game in a few hours this way.  Albeit, with a rudimentary skin at that point.</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

<br/><br/>
first you should update your lightwave to 8.5 .. go to newtek.com and download the update ... &#13;
<br/><br/>
after you updated lightwave you should add the "Flip UVs" button to the Modeler menu layout ... "<span style="font-weight: bold">Edit_&gt;Edit Menu Layout</span> in this window go to "<span style="font-weight: bold">Point Maps</span>" then select <span style="font-weight: bold">Flip UVs</span> and on the right side you can add it to a menu of your choice..&#13;
<br/><br/>
(you will find much more missing buttons in this window.. take a break and look for them!) &#13;
<br/><br/>
and don't forget to "unweld" selected geometry if you flip parts of your uv map that are welded to other ! after flipping and repositioning you can hit "<span style="font-weight: bold">m</span>" to weld your points&#13;
<br/><br/>
a little flip example : (my little treasure box, for large pictures click on them)&#13;

			</tr><tr><td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">I've been working on becoming a modeller in lightwave for a while now and I'm having some issues with my UV Map for my shotgun I'm working on. &#13;
<br/><br/>
I wish I had some screenshots to help, but I left them at work  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0"/><br/><br/>
I'll do my best to explain. &#13;
<br/><br/>
I made a surface (select polygons - 'q' ) out of a portion of the gun. I then proceeded to 'Make UV' etc. The selected area is cylindrical on the Z axis; I'm sure of it, so I know that's not the issue. &#13;
<br/><br/>
I made my UV in Photoshop and saved it into my textures archive in lightwave (1024x1024 texture, jpeg, max quality). However, the second I opened it up via image editor and layed the image over the actual UV, and applied it live to the texture-view of the model, the image became extremely low-res, as in it-looks-like-its-100x100-but-stretched-to-1000x1000 low-res. Very pixelated. Also, on my image for the purpose of the model I put the text "Model Version 1.21.3" and although it is very foggy on the model, I can tell that it's .. backwards/inverted/in 'mirror code' (incoherent on the model). &#13;
<br/><br/>
I fixed it by realizing that every square on my grid (after I turned the grid back on via display options) measured 3 feet, whereas my image was a normal 72px/". So, I resized my 12 foot shotgun into a reasonable realistic size and changed the grid. It is now about 3 feet long, each square on the grid being 1 foot. It seemed to help somewhat, but just on the verge of 'noticable difference.' &#13;
<br/><br/>
The next thing that I did was hit 'd' again for display, and I cannot recall what tab it was under right now, but I believe it was layout. Not sure. Either way, the value was something very low, in the 60's or 70's button. I hit the '1024' button and whatever it did, it apparently worked. The image now appears to be the correct resolution on the model, and is quite clear. &#13;
<br/><br/>
But the text is also quite clearly backwards &gt;.^&#13;
<br/><br/>
Any help on re-doing this, or making sure all my images fit the model would be great!<br/>_________________<br/>.Mods.C++.Animation.Graphics.Doom.WebDesign.&#13;

But that doesn't help much if I have to flip every image before I attatch the uv. &#13;
<br/><br/><br/>
This is ofcourse only my first model in lightwave, so I don't care so much about quality so much as I want to get it done and know how to do it. But I looked at a few of BNA!'s tips/mini tutorial things and found that I could actually create a reasonable 'high' poly model out of that shabby 104 poly's that I had:&#13;

<br/><br/>
I end up unwrapping everything manually, even simple objects, because it's the best way (that I know of) to get everything right with a minimal number of seams.&#13;
<br/><br/>
The orientation matters.  The text isn't reversed on the model, the UV just isn't oriented in the fashion you want.  I seriously believe it's Lightwave's method of unwrapping.  Using Atlas might produce better results, since it can go piece by piece that way, but then the skin will have more seams than is required.&#13;
<br/><br/>
This is why I would encourage you to start unwrapping manually.  It seems assinine for a cylinder, I know, but the more practice you get in the better off you'll be when you need to skin something more organic.&#13;
<br/><br/>
I use the method described in "approach 2" here: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.newtek.com/products/lightwave/tutorials/uvmapping/character_UV/index.html" target="_blank" class="postlink">http://www.newtek.com/products/lightwave/tutorials/uvmapping/character_UV/index.html</a>&#13;
<br/><br/>
This method gives you total control over where the seams will be generated (important with bump mapping), as well as how much detail specific parts of your model will be relative to other parts (on a shotgun barrel, for instance, your pixels might be better spent with details along the circumference of the cylinder, as opposed to along the length).&#13;
<br/><br/>
And even if you ultimately go back to using projections for most of your UV maps, practice you get in with this method will help you be more bold when editing your UVs, and help you understand how inverted, rotated, skewed, and scaled triangles will affect your result.</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

All that I did for that particular UV map was unwrap the 'black' part in the first picture. You can't really see that in the uvmap window [upper left] because I just made an entire square flat texture to put over it. I originally had a clean-cut texture, but I was having issues with a white line that kept showing up where the uv 'coordinates' were 'off' the plaine. &#13;
<br/><br/>
For example, what should I do when I'm looking at the unwrapped model in the uv window, and not all of it fits into the black square? Just move it over, then PrintScreen and do the texture?<br/>_________________<br/>.Mods.C++.Animation.Graphics.Doom.WebDesign.&#13;

Just move it over, then PrintScreen and do the texture?</td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody">&#13;
<br/><br/>
Totally!  I can't see your mesh in the UV view in that screenshot, but I'm assuming you might also have to scale that part of the model down.&#13;
<br/><br/>
As far as printscreening for the texture...&#13;
<br/><br/>
I assume you're making this model for Doom 3.  That's all I model for so my workflow is, as far as I know, the quickest way from nothing to in-game with lightwave.  So let me describe how I do it.  Not saying your way is wrong, I realize that's the way it's done quite often (or I guess instead of printscreen a modeler more experienced than us might make a quick render in layout using the uv map, but I don't know how to do that).&#13;
<br/><br/>
Step: The First&#13;
<br/>
Anyways, I create the High Poly mesh first.  In this mesh I assign up to six different surfaces on the model, based on how I plan to skin it later.  I have a Red, Green, and Blue surface with smoothing on (for organics), and Red, Green, and Blue surface with smoothing off (for flat surfaces and harsh angles).  There's no need to set the color to actually be red, green, and blue until you're ready to renderbump.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Step: The Second&#13;
<br/>
I create the Low Poly mesh second.  It's easy to do with the High Poly mesh in the background.  I usually just draw the triangles by hand, with the add points tool, and then selecting points and either making a triangle, quad, triangle fan, or triangle bridge.  It's not as fast as merging surfaces, or using qemLOSS2 or a lot of other ways, but it's precise and puts all the right triangles in all the right places.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Step: The Second Jr.&#13;
<br/>
I create a morph map called "flat" and proceed to unwrap my UV map here.  This method is described pretty well in that article I linked earlier.  When I'm done I use the Planar projection with manual settings.  You can usually leave the Center variables alone, but you'll probably want to modify the Size variables so that they're even (i.e. not X of 1.18 m and Y of 1.12, you'd want both to be 1.18 if you're projecting on the Z plane).&#13;
<br/><br/>
Step: His Highness the Third&#13;
<br/>
Let's review what we have.  <ol type="1"><li>A high poly mesh with a handful of different colored surfaces.</li><li>A low poly mesh with a surface that points to our material and a UV map.</li></ol>  So now we make sure the material we're pointing to has the renderbump command, with "-colormap" specified.  Go to Doom3 and renderbump &lt;path_to_low_poly.lwo&gt;.&#13;
<br/><br/>
This should produce a bump map and a color map in the path we specified in the shader.  In photoshop I use the bumpmap to discern where the triangles fall (this serves as my mesh view, and it's surprisingly easy to work with), and I use the color map to make quick selections of different parts so that I can, for instance, just select the red channel and use that as a mask on a layer containing a wood texture for the gun's stock, and then select the green channel and use that as a mask on a layer containing metal for the gun's barrel.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Then there's all sorts of voodoo I work for refining the skin, like my tutorial on modwiki where I base the specularmap on the bumpmap to start with.&#13;
<br/><br/>
This is the workflow that has served me best thus far.  It's a combination of Goliath's early tutorial with lightwave, id's iddevnet way, and that uv unwrapping article I linked.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Working in earnest, with my modest modeling skills, I can have a near-final model in game in a few hours this way.  Albeit, with a rudimentary skin at that point.</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

<br/><br/>
first you should update your lightwave to 8.5 .. go to newtek.com and download the update ... &#13;
<br/><br/>
after you updated lightwave you should add the "Flip UVs" button to the Modeler menu layout ... "<span style="font-weight: bold">Edit_&gt;Edit Menu Layout</span> in this window go to "<span style="font-weight: bold">Point Maps</span>" then select <span style="font-weight: bold">Flip UVs</span> and on the right side you can add it to a menu of your choice..&#13;
<br/><br/>
(you will find much more missing buttons in this window.. take a break and look for them!) &#13;
<br/><br/>
and don't forget to "unweld" selected geometry if you flip parts of your uv map that are welded to other ! after flipping and repositioning you can hit "<span style="font-weight: bold">m</span>" to weld your points&#13;
<br/><br/>
a little flip example : (my little treasure box, for large pictures click on them)&#13;
