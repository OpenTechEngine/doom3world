<br /><br />I think you got him wrong - my guess it's about self shadowing and the issues involved, especially shadow popping and the small one pixel shadows flickering like it's snowing.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p159286" date="Posted: Tue Oct 10, 2006 2:52 pm "><author>kat</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">You may get rid of issues related to shadows but you've done it in a way that's not especially FPS friendly in this engine.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p159719" date="Posted: Sun Oct 15, 2006 9:54 am "><author>dirk</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">i think he is right, next gen computing will handle on the displaying side a very high detailed scene, bu tim not sure if there are the z buffer shadows the best way to do the shadowing. maybe you get with shadowmaping (btw.shadowmap are not like static lightmaps <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205143512im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> but it works close to, but refresh every frame or how often you want <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205143512im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />.) a better result with a better performance. is it possible to use shadowmaps in doom3? ihave nothing read about this. shadowmaps are often the better solution for displaying realistic looking shadows and you get an shadow back just from a single faces (3verst), tahts not bad. but im not a coder, just a artist, but im intressed in the logical ways behind.
<br /><br />i like this head, is still a to high res mesh but if you dont want to display much of these characters at the same time, it should no be a problem.
<br /><br />btw.(polyg means much edges <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205143512im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> ) so 4200 is very relativ, not in your case i can see your wire, but it can also means 1000000000000000000 of tris. important is the vertex count!
<br /><br /><br />btw, im very interested in your good models <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205143512im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p159120" date="Posted: Sun Oct 08, 2006 11:19 am "><author>psychoart</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">low poly head 4200 polys <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225090226im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225090226/http://img218.imageshack.us/img218/8753/wirenx5.jpg">http://img218.imageshack.us/img218/8753/wirenx5.jpg</a><!-- m -->

<br /><br />i like this head, is still a to high res mesh but if you dont want to display much of these characters at the same time, it should no be a problem.
<br /><br />btw.(polyg means much edges <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> ) so 4200 is very relativ, not in your case i can see your wire, but it can also means 1000000000000000000 of tris. important is the vertex count!
<br /><br /><br />btw, im very interested in your good models <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p159120" date="Posted: Sun Oct 08, 2006 10:19 am "><author>psychoart</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">low poly head 4200 polys <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img218.imageshack.us/img218/8753/wirenx5.jpg">http://img218.imageshack.us/img218/8753/wirenx5.jpg</a><!-- m -->&#13;<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img218.imageshack.us/img218/9838/meshqe6.jpg">http://img218.imageshack.us/img218/9838/meshqe6.jpg</a><!-- m -->&#13;<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img218.imageshack.us/img218/8296/shadnatosr9.jpg">http://img218.imageshack.us/img218/8296/shadnatosr9.jpg</a><!-- m -->&#13;<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img225.imageshack.us/img225/1764/allxp5.jpg">http://img225.imageshack.us/img225/1764/allxp5.jpg</a><!-- m -->&#13;<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://img154.imageshack.us/img154/9758/renedersgu0.jpg">http://img154.imageshack.us/img154/9758/renedersgu0.jpg</a><!-- m --></div>]]></body></post><post id="p159121" date="Posted: Sun Oct 08, 2006 10:33 am "><author>6th Venom</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Wow!

<br /><br />Increasing polycount isn't really the issue as the engine can handle huge amounts, however you run a greater risk of FPS performance hits because of the way the lighting works.
<br /><br />It's pretty 'moot' actually that you'll get better shadows with higher polycount  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /><br /><br />@ psychoart : please try and keep your image 640 width, it just makes seeing the whole thin much easier (you can link out to much larger res images where necessary.
<br /><br />Having said that, damn nice work you have there. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p159282" date="Posted: Tue Oct 10, 2006 2:31 pm "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">kat wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Increasing polycount isn't really the issue as the engine can handle huge amounts, however you run a greater risk of FPS performance hits because of the way the lighting works.</div>
<br /><br />I think you got him wrong - my guess it's about self shadowing and the issues involved, especially shadow popping and the small one pixel shadows flickering like it's snowing.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p159286" date="Posted: Tue Oct 10, 2006 2:52 pm "><author>kat</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">You may get rid of issues related to shadows but you've done it in a way that's not especially FPS friendly in this engine.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p159719" date="Posted: Sun Oct 15, 2006 9:54 am "><author>dirk</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">i think he is right, next gen computing will handle on the displaying side a very high detailed scene, bu tim not sure if there are the z buffer shadows the best way to do the shadowing. maybe you get with shadowmaping (btw.shadowmap are not like static lightmaps <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> but it works close to, but refresh every frame or how often you want <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />.) a better result with a better performance. is it possible to use shadowmaps in doom3? ihave nothing read about this. shadowmaps are often the better solution for displaying realistic looking shadows and you get an shadow back just from a single faces (3verst), tahts not bad. but im not a coder, just a artist, but im intressed in the logical ways behind.
<br /><br />i like this head, is still a to high res mesh but if you dont want to display much of these characters at the same time, it should no be a problem.
<br /><br />btw.(polyg means much edges <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> ) so 4200 is very relativ, not in your case i can see your wire, but it can also means 1000000000000000000 of tris. important is the vertex count!
<br /><br /><br />btw, im very interested in your good models <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /></div>]]></body></post></posts></thread></xml>
