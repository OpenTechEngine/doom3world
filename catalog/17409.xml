<br/>
bunch of people kept telling me I should switch from gimp to photoshop so I finally invested the cash <img src="/web/20061013024241im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" border="0"/>   Anyhow I did the first thing most folks do I imediatly went looking for plugins&#13;
<br/>
as any of you know that have played with my texture packs that my rock textures just eek by as okay if that&#13;
<br/>
well I found&#13;
<br/><a href="/web/20061013024241/http://www.filterforge.com/" target="_blank">http://www.filterforge.com</a>  free beta if you sign up&#13;
<br/>
anyhow I can honestly say doom3 has never looked so good&#13;
<br/>
it is allready set up create incredibly textures ""INCREDIBLE"" for even novices&#13;
<br/>
but best of all if you look under&#13;
<br/>
filter&#13;
<br/>
****&#13;
<br/>
render maps&#13;
<br/><br/>
it is allready set up to seperate your picture into&#13;
<br/>
diffuse&#13;
<br/>
specular&#13;
<br/>
height &#13;
<br/>
normal &#13;
<br/>
and more&#13;
<br/>
it has a built in editor that even an idiot like me can create his own plugins&#13;
<br/>
I can honestly say the textures Ive been creating in game using this are off the charts &#13;
<br/>
the normals have never looked so good&#13;
<br/>
this is one you should all REALLY check out&#13;
<br/><br/>
hate to say it but when its released estimated price is between&#13;
<br/>
$200&#13;
<br/>
$300&#13;
<br/>
us dollars&#13;
<br/>
but they say if you contribute plugins and they become popular with users at all they will give developers a free copy&#13;
<br/>
Ive allready got 12 Im planning on submitting because this is a find worth keeping&#13;

it taxed my dual core with 4gbram preaty good. The one I created late last night to create walls of natural shaped rock and mortor of course its actually a hybrid of two I had allready created but it took 5 min to produce the end result --ouch -- but it was worth it with the end result&#13;

glad to hear you guys are impressed and its not just a texture nevbie popping a boner over nothing <img src="/web/20061013024241im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" border="0"/><br/>_________________<br/>it was bad enough imps and maggots everywhere but when that Hellknight copped a feel that was to much now I really was in hell</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>
