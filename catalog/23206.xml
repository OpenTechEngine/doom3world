Nearly all of the applicants were skilled enough to be recruited onto the team (5 of 7). Four of which are already set up and doing work. We found modellers who double as texture artists and a few mappers, as well as two others to help us on the side without actually joining the team (due to their own agendas). The one thing we didnt get which we still need is a creature modeller.<br /><br />I write this ad now because we need a Particle guy, someone that is skilled in the particle editor as well as making textures for use in that. A couple of us on the team are pretty skilled with the particle editor, and we have many skilled texture artists, but we don't have one person that is good at both. Our mod would benefit greatly from someone that has experience in creating convincing particles from scratch.<br /><br />If you think you could help us out, please let us know.<br /><br />edit: this is a weird one for showing previous work. if you have some, great. if not, we can just have you make one for us to see how skilled you are.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p219480" date="Posted: Mon Oct 12, 2009 10:45 pm "><author>The Happy Friar</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">i think you're going to have a HECK of a time finding a particle person.  nobody seemed to really do much with it.
