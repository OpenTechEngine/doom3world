<br /><br />In addition, you can link to other tutorials and add information to it.
<br /><br />Basic Example for this tutorial :-
<br /><br />1. Create a room complete with a ceiling. (screenshot)
<br />2. Select the ceiling and move it up by 128 units (screenshot)
<br />3. Select all 4 walls (screenshot)
<br />4. Hit SPACE to duplicate the walls and move them above the original walls so that they fit exactly on top. Make sure your ceiling brush fits exactly on top of the new duplicated walls (screenshot)
<br />5. Select the new walls and ceiling and go to your texture browser, select skies and choose the commonoutside texture and apply it to your selected walls and ceiling by clicking on the texture (screenshot)
<br /><br />That pretty much sums up things.
<br />I think your doing a great job with these tutorials, however, I reckon you could save yourself and others some bandwidth by doing standard text and screenshot tutorials for the more simple concepts ?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p39877" date="Posted: Sun Aug 22, 2004 2:48 am "><author>gunwolf</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Some people would complain if the had to walk a block for $1000.00

<br /><br />Yeah you're probably right. : )
<br /><br />Well I enjoyed the tutorial - the video and the written one on the skybox.
<br />Now I can finally use that huge deck I built! LOL

<br /><br />Today you will most likley get a CUSTOM SKYBOX TUTORIAL, and perhaps HEALTH TERMINAL (i know everyone knows, but I wanna make a vid anyways), and maybe maybe, a TWO SIDED TEXTURE tutorial (havn't tested this yet, but if it works, it's the supreme way to do glass and other breakables.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p40008" date="Posted: Sun Aug 22, 2004 12:04 pm "><author>bb_matt</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Sure - I get where your coming from, it's an opinion thing.

<br /><br />I'm with you bb_matt, w/out audio they are could be unusable and could be msleading to inexperienced mappers. I appreciate them but seriously most of what I saw in the ones I watched you could find out by just having a working knowledge of Q3A/Id softwares general game entity/trigger system and opening up a couple of the Doom3 maps to see how things were specifically done in that engine. 
<br /><br />Another point: Archiving for the future is out of the question with such large files as well. There are a couple of archives of Q3A tutorials which still get traffic ... I doubt the person paying for the hosting of them would be quite a willing to be so generous if it weren't for the fact they are all HTML-and-image format and relatively small. 
<br /><br />Don't get defensive Mnemic, <span style="font-weight: bold">what you're doing is quite generous and time and bandwidth consuming...</span>  these are just my opinions, I am sure for every one guy like me there are ten people who find them useful.  
<br /><br />I guess the bottom line is that to me, telling someone <span style="font-style: italic">why </span>something is being done is even more important than showing them how. THe old "give a man a fish" versus "teach a man to fish" effect, y'know what I am saying... and just to dull any sting of my criticism even more, thanks again for your work, man.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p40032" date="Posted: Sun Aug 22, 2004 2:08 pm "><author>MNeMiC</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Hmm, That last part was pretty hard to read and understand for someone not-english I think =P
<br /><br />Anyways, good news, I will most likley have the VT's hosted by doom3files.com - that means kinda unlimited bandwidth which leads to not to much worries about filesize which leads to me being able to add voice to the tutorials =)
<br /><br />I might add voice to the older tutorials pretty soon, just a coulpe of days perhaps.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p42762" date="Posted: Fri Aug 27, 2004 3:01 pm "><author>MNeMiC</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Hey, here you go, sound added to this one aswell, over half of the MNeMiC.tk VT's now have sound.
