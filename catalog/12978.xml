<br /><br />With that bit of legalese behind us, let's move on.
<br /><br /> I have tried, and have been rather successful, getting a custom player model into Quake 4's MP player selection lineup. I call this creation, "The Shape".

<br /><br />Because I had to replace vanilla game content to make this initial trial work, The Shape has kind of "re-organized" the Corpse player model available.

<br /><br />it sounded to me like he did that for this particular test. perhaps he will post an update when he finds a way to mod it out.
<br /><br />with my little understanding of the whole thing i would think it would just be a .def file addition.

<br /><br />then find entityDef player_marine_mp_ui and do the same thing.
<br /><br />Just for your info the one in player_marine_mp is for when you're already in a game, the mp_ui one is for before you've joined.

<br /><br />One problem with custom models though, the player select screen always uses the marine idle anim, so any model that doesn't use these anims is going to look messed up.

<br /><br />I've done lots of models for Unreal Tournament based games, but never for any of the Quake games.  As such, I'm a bit out of my depth.
<br /><br />Can anyone recommend a good site to go to that explains the process from start to finish with specifics?  (Unreal/Epic games has the UDN site, which does just that, containing many tutorials with screenshots that go through everything required from start to finish in your modelling suite, and also from start to finish for importing to the game and making sure you can actually SEE it as a choice in your player selection.
<br /><br />If there's a site like that I haven't found it.  the iddevnet site doesn't say all that much....
<br /><br />I'm pretty familiar with the process of actually CREATING the model, rigging it up and animating it, even with custom skeletons.  I'm also pretty familar with the EXPORTING process to .md5 mesh and anim format with Der_Ton's exporting program. 
<br /><br />The only things I'm NOT sure on, are what's needed for their IK setup, how exactly that's supposed to be rigged for a model, and how to organize and write up the model so it can be used in game.
<br /><br />Also, custom SOUNDS for the model - the iddevnet pages say how to import a sound into the game - but not for a specific player model....
<br /><br /><br />Any advice in that regard is welcome.  It would be kinda neat to see my RAPTOR model in Quake4 with a normalmap applied....  <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203061323/http://home.comcast.net/~gregfisk/ut2004.htm">http://home.comcast.net/~gregfisk/ut2004.htm</a><!-- m -->

<br /><br />I've done lots of models for Unreal Tournament based games, but never for any of the Quake games.  As such, I'm a bit out of my depth.
<br /><br />Can anyone recommend a good site to go to that explains the process from start to finish with specifics?  (Unreal/Epic games has the UDN site, which does just that, containing many tutorials with screenshots that go through everything required from start to finish in your modelling suite, and also from start to finish for importing to the game and making sure you can actually SEE it as a choice in your player selection.
<br /><br />If there's a site like that I haven't found it.  the iddevnet site doesn't say all that much....
<br /><br />I'm pretty familiar with the process of actually CREATING the model, rigging it up and animating it, even with custom skeletons.  I'm also pretty familar with the EXPORTING process to .md5 mesh and anim format with Der_Ton's exporting program. 
<br /><br />The only things I'm NOT sure on, are what's needed for their IK setup, how exactly that's supposed to be rigged for a model, and how to organize and write up the model so it can be used in game.
<br /><br />Also, custom SOUNDS for the model - the iddevnet pages say how to import a sound into the game - but not for a specific player model....
<br /><br /><br />Any advice in that regard is welcome.  It would be kinda neat to see my RAPTOR model in Quake4 with a normalmap applied....  <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203061323/http://home.comcast.net/~gregfisk/ut2004.htm">http://home.comcast.net/~gregfisk/ut2004.htm</a><!-- m -->

<br /><br />I've done lots of models for Unreal Tournament based games, but never for any of the Quake games.  As such, I'm a bit out of my depth.
<br /><br />Can anyone recommend a good site to go to that explains the process from start to finish with specifics?  (Unreal/Epic games has the UDN site, which does just that, containing many tutorials with screenshots that go through everything required from start to finish in your modelling suite, and also from start to finish for importing to the game and making sure you can actually SEE it as a choice in your player selection.
<br /><br />If there's a site like that I haven't found it.  the iddevnet site doesn't say all that much....
<br /><br />I'm pretty familiar with the process of actually CREATING the model, rigging it up and animating it, even with custom skeletons.  I'm also pretty familar with the EXPORTING process to .md5 mesh and anim format with Der_Ton's exporting program. 
<br /><br />The only things I'm NOT sure on, are what's needed for their IK setup, how exactly that's supposed to be rigged for a model, and how to organize and write up the model so it can be used in game.
<br /><br />Also, custom SOUNDS for the model - the iddevnet pages say how to import a sound into the game - but not for a specific player model....
<br /><br /><br />Any advice in that regard is welcome.  It would be kinda neat to see my RAPTOR model in Quake4 with a normalmap applied....  <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203103605/http://home.comcast.net/~gregfisk/ut2004.htm">http://home.comcast.net/~gregfisk/ut2004.htm</a><!-- m -->

A modified (rescaled, repostioned, whatever) rig would require a whole new export of the anims needed for MP, and a custom rig (new bones and bone names) would require a new DEF file as well as new anims. Duck Nukem, made in 3ds Max, has a custom rig.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p121131" date="Posted: Fri Nov 11, 2005 8:38 pm "><author>dw</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Well its good, but some cases will require whole new rig, animations, DEF file etc.

<br /><br />HI everyone,
<br /><br />I am wokring on a mod for q4 (q4max) and I am not having much luck getting the models in,
<br /><br />Since youve obviously got some good info on this, can you please show me where I can learn it as well or please tell me what I need to do?
<br /><br />Thank you
<br /><br />heres a shot of the model so far

<br /><br />I am mostly wokring In max But I can work in maya as well, I can import an dexport no problem, so my quesdtion is how do i bind this mesh to the player animations already in q4?
<br /><br />In q3 it was as simple and making your animations and lining them up with the text file contaning the movement markers etc.

<br /><br />I've done lots of models for Unreal Tournament based games, but never for any of the Quake games.  As such, I'm a bit out of my depth.
<br /><br />Can anyone recommend a good site to go to that explains the process from start to finish with specifics?  (Unreal/Epic games has the UDN site, which does just that, containing many tutorials with screenshots that go through everything required from start to finish in your modelling suite, and also from start to finish for importing to the game and making sure you can actually SEE it as a choice in your player selection.
<br /><br />If there's a site like that I haven't found it.  the iddevnet site doesn't say all that much....
<br /><br />I'm pretty familiar with the process of actually CREATING the model, rigging it up and animating it, even with custom skeletons.  I'm also pretty familar with the EXPORTING process to .md5 mesh and anim format with Der_Ton's exporting program. 
<br /><br />The only things I'm NOT sure on, are what's needed for their IK setup, how exactly that's supposed to be rigged for a model, and how to organize and write up the model so it can be used in game.
<br /><br />Also, custom SOUNDS for the model - the iddevnet pages say how to import a sound into the game - but not for a specific player model....
<br /><br /><br />Any advice in that regard is welcome.  It would be kinda neat to see my RAPTOR model in Quake4 with a normalmap applied....  <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203103605/http://home.comcast.net/~gregfisk/ut2004.htm">http://home.comcast.net/~gregfisk/ut2004.htm</a><!-- m -->

Feet end up halfway into geometry and other strange things seems to happen involving the IK setup of our monsters. Does anybody have a clear explenation as to how the IK setup works in Doom3? How can we make sure feet stay ON the ground and don't end up INSIDE it?<br /><br />We've literally searched every forum and post here on Doom 3 world. But whenever we get close threads just 'end' like this one. I know other mods and teams were succesful in putting enemies into the game so it can't be that hard. Iddevnet has no information on this at all.
