<br/><br/>
1) can you give us some more info on what you're trying to do? Is the custom weapon a md5 or ase?&#13;
<br/><br/>
2) could be the material definition or the reference of the material in the model file. Can you post some of that? &#13;

It's hard to tell what you're doing wrong, when there's almost no description of what you are doing...<br/>_________________<br/><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/" target="_blank" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/site/img/d3w.gif" border="0"/> Staff</a>&#13;

<br/><br/>
I've built a revolver, the gun consists of the gun itself and the bullet spindle. I've turned the the arms and the gun parts into one object and rigged the bones to the model. I create all the md5anim states and md5mesh files needed to get the pistol working.&#13;
<br/><br/>
I get the weapon in the game only the pistol is deformed, out of shape and scale as if it resized and repostioned through the export. I've tried a few things to remedy this but the outcome is always the same. I've noticed if the gun isn't complicated and isn't built up of multiple parts then the model seems fine in the game (but this makes or boring animation)&#13;
<br/><br/>
for the gun itself I've just added two bones a gun bone and the bullet spindle bone so I can create the reload animations. I atach the spindle bone to the gun bone and finally the gun bone to the wrist bone of the gun hand.&#13;
<br/><br/>
here is a pic of the model to give you better ideas (bare in mind I DO get it in the game only it's screwed up)&#13;

The exporter doesn't handle that, since there's no scaling of bones in md5.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Another possibility where things go wrong is the weights of the skin modifier. From reading your CV I assume you're familiar with how the skin modifier works so that's probably not the reason.&#13;
<br/><br/>
If you want you can send me the .max files and I'll have a look.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/" target="_blank" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/site/img/d3w.gif" border="0"/> Staff</a>&#13;

The model was still enlarged. it's just this little problem then I'd be sorted. The gun fires and plays through the animation states only it's massive. It's just annoying cause I really want to animate this weapon haha.&#13;

You are working on the Hexen mod?? Just cuirous but is their any room for a modeller? I can't texture for **** but I'm a strong mapper modeller. I've just a got a job at a games company as a level designer and I start in a few weeks but I enjoyed Hexen/heritic first time round and would love to be apart of this.&#13;

If there is enough people I undertstand.&#13;
