I'm aware that the NES sold very well in large part because people wanted to play Mario, but it's still an "unfair" statistic.</div><br /><br />Valve re-sells everything with each new package to artificially inflate their sales but people don't mind that.  Valve also bundled HL2 with ATI cards but those still count as sales.  Plus you can't argue against bundling a game with a console: they all did &amp; and it was a better value.  Still counts as a stat too.  Throw in the fact it was sold in the 80's &amp; early 90's before any re-release was made, that's HUGE sales.  IE a big game in the 80's would sell ~400,000, Mario sold a few million (let's say 2), a big game today sells ~3million (Doom 3 was big, Fallout 3 already shipped 4.7+ million units).  That's an inflation of 7.5x bringing the inflation for sales of mario to 15 million.<br /><br />either way, the point still stands: make a great game &amp; people will buy.  Like you said, people bought a whole console system JUST for that game.  <br /><br />Epic just can't make great games anymore &amp; are trying to find ways to make more $$ w/o making great content.  Similar to what the car industry is doing (people don't want their type of cars so they're trying to find ways to keep making $$ w/o making cars people want).  What will non-gamers think when they read the headline "Epic bailout planned".  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081118183255im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p207497" date="Posted: Wed Nov 12, 2008 12:34 pm "><author>kat</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Oooo lookie... yet another reason people will use to excuse pirating and warez <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081118183255im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />Also, when the price of just about everything (consumer good) has come down, why are music, games and videos still the same or (slowly) increasing?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p207498" date="Posted: Wed Nov 12, 2008 12:47 pm "><author>Deadite4</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Also, when the price of just about everything (consumer good) has come down, why are music, games and videos still the same or (slowly) increasing?</div><br /><br />Agreed.

Odds are people rented the first one &amp; like it so much they bought the 2nd one.  but his theory is stupid: make a good game &amp; people WILL buy.  Super Mario Bros is THE highest selling game, ever, period.  First in a series, considered one of the best.  People still buy it for Wii even though it's been out for decades &amp; you can find it free on the net.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p207475" date="Posted: Wed Nov 12, 2008 1:10 am "><author>iceheart</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">The Happy Friar wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Super Mario Bros is THE highest selling game, ever, period.</div><br /><br />Only because it was bundled with every NES sold.

Valve also bundled HL2 with ATI cards but those still count as sales.  Plus you can't argue against bundling a game with a console: they all did &amp; and it was a better value.  Still counts as a stat too.  Throw in the fact it was sold in the 80's &amp; early 90's before any re-release was made, that's HUGE sales.  IE a big game in the 80's would sell ~400,000, Mario sold a few million (let's say 2), a big game today sells ~3million (Doom 3 was big, Fallout 3 already shipped 4.7+ million units).  That's an inflation of 7.5x bringing the inflation for sales of mario to 15 million.<br /><br />either way, the point still stands: make a great game &amp; people will buy.  Like you said, people bought a whole console system JUST for that game.  <br /><br />Epic just can't make great games anymore &amp; are trying to find ways to make more $$ w/o making great content.  Similar to what the car industry is doing (people don't want their type of cars so they're trying to find ways to keep making $$ w/o making cars people want).  What will non-gamers think when they read the headline "Epic bailout planned".  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081118183657im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p207497" date="Posted: Wed Nov 12, 2008 12:34 pm "><author>kat</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Oooo lookie... yet another reason people will use to excuse pirating and warez <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081118183657im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />Also, when the price of just about everything (consumer good) has come down, why are music, games and videos still the same or (slowly) increasing?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p207498" date="Posted: Wed Nov 12, 2008 12:47 pm "><author>Deadite4</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Also, when the price of just about everything (consumer good) has come down, why are music, games and videos still the same or (slowly) increasing?</div><br /><br />Agreed.
