They all use the same texture&#13;
<br/><br/>
Now,  I can't name them all the same thing in LW....   which it appears I need to do in order to use the same texture within doom&#13;
<br/><br/>
Is there away I can have three differently named surfaces use the same texture within doom?&#13;
<br/><br/>
maybe if there was a wildcard type of deal  like:&#13;
<br/><br/>
models/mapobjects/airlock/airlockbrace&#13;
<br/>
models/mapobjects/airlock/airlockbr*&#13;
<br/>
models/mapobjects/airlock/airlockb*&#13;
<br/><br/>
Then I could name my surfaces different things, but still use the same texture in LW.&#13;
<br/><br/>
(I also want to stay away from unwelding vertices for the sake of smoothing, it's bad practice  )&#13;
<br/><br/><br/><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">*** NOTE&#13;
<br/><br/>
before we get into a lightwave bashing session,  yes I know that it sucks the way lightwaves smoothing works,  and yes I know that going through max or another package for smoothing would work fine.  Infact,  I had to go from Lightwave -&gt; Max on a commercial project using Unreal Engine,  just because of the smoothing issue. (and vertex painting)&#13;
<br/><br/>
I would be doing this again,  however there are two reasons why I don't want to go through max.&#13;
<br/><br/>
1. I own Lightwave,  I do not own Max.&#13;
<br/><br/>
2. Going through 2 modeling packages kills your workflow and speed.</span>&#13;

Thanks in advance for any help.  Doom3world is an awesome resource!</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

if you open the surface properties, it lists the shader name for each surface. and you apply smoothing on a shader/surface basis. so i don't understand either how you could split up what get's smoothed without multiple shaders that are the same but with different names.&#13;
<br/><br/>
i've setteled for multiple shaders with the same parameters to achive the smoothing i want. i'm all ears for an easier way.&#13;
<br/><br/>
btw, i like LW's layout better than 3ds Max for some reason. but i like 3ds Max grid much beter than LW's. it's a toss up, neither is perfect. plus editing an ase to correct the shader path everytime a change is made drives me nuts.</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

<br/><br/>
 What do you mean' the interface looks daunting'? It has rows of button with text written on them telling you what they're for. I'd ban icons in apps if I could.&#13;
<br/>
 I think speed is lightwave's main asset, a lightwave guru could make a given model faster than a guru in any other app. There are no shitty manipulator handles to get in the way, and tools take their center point from where ever your mouse is, not like Maya where you have to hit the insert key and drag the manipulator handle around. You don't have to select points before you move them, there are tools like drag, magnet dragnet etc so you can sculpt a model in subpatch mode, it's so easy to take a generic template head and sculpt it into something completely different in no time - and there is just generally dozens of litle tools that make life easy and make modeling so intuitive. I'm sure a lot of it is do so with the fact that lightwave model is just a modeler, not like all other 3d apps, where the modleing happens in the same space and interface as everyting else the app can do. Modeler is dedicated entirely to modeling.&#13;
<br/>
 Of course, some of this is due to the fact I've  been using it for 2 years and have the hotkeys memorized and laid out the way I want them, and know every single tool, what it does and when to use it most efficently. When I'm modeling I don't even have to think about which tool or key to hit next, it just happens, so nothing interupts my flow of modeling. I am biased, yes)<br/>_________________<br/>Civillisation will not attain perfection until the last stone, from the last church, falls on the last priest.&#13;
