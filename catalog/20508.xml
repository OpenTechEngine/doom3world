Basically I have an animal in a cage that needs to play it's 'idle' animation until triggered to play its 'spazout' animation, and after that it needs to return to an 'idle2' animation. There is no end_anim parameter in the editor so its not making life easy. I've tried mucking around with num_anims but I can't get it working.<br /><br />Any help on how to go about setting this up would be appreciated,<br /><br />Cheers.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p188426" date="Posted: Fri Sep 14, 2007 5:02 am "><author>Horror</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Heya,<br /><br />I'm trying to trigger multiple animations on an md5 model.
