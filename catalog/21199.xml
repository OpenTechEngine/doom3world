I'm curious about how much, if at all, you can modify a model that is already rigged and weighted to a skeleton, without having to repaint the skin weights.  Specifically, can you do any of the following?<br /><br />1.  Resize the entire mesh.<br /><br />2.  Split the mesh into submeshes (but not move anything)<br /><br />3.  Add new polys to the mesh.<br /><br />4.  Resize or move the verts on the uvmap (but not on the mesh itself)<br /><br />5.  Modify the amount of smoothing on a surface.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p195119" date="Posted: Sun Feb 17, 2008 12:39 am "><author>Springheel</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I'm a maya newb, trying to learn enough to work with our mod's animated AI models.
