The only disadvantage to this aproach IMO is that theres not alot of tiling going on so these models are quite hungry on texture memory, but still, I like the effect.

The arches will be in place of the arches on the face of the building itself, so there will be a large hole with bricks and rubble piled up underneath, Ill do a few tests with different lighting soon, I just want to try and get the model complete first.

<br />its pretty new though and Im sure it will be developed into something more useful for games, those guys are pretty clever over at, <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205145843/http://graphics.uni-konstanz.de/publikationen/">http://graphics.uni-konstanz.de/publikationen/</a><!-- m --> and alot of the stuff they do is actually for realtime environment simulations, so im sure they'l develope it further.

<br />Its not showing the best fps there, nothing's optimised in regards to textures and it seems to drop about 10 fps when I take a screenshot for some reason, but im not too concerned about the stats at the moment, i should be able to optimise it later if I need to, to get it running decently. Also ill be giving all the assets from my wip to the guys at the Ground Zero mod so you'll probably get hold of them fairly soon to use in your maps.

<br /><br />Im really just putting it in the game so that its ready for the ground zero mod, it'll have to be heavily modified to work I think, especially if we make it destructible.
<br />I was just going to keep it in max initially, just because it looks better, with alpha shadows and soft shadows and all that but I was advised to put it ingame for good reason;

<br />Its not showing the best fps there, nothing's optimised in regards to textures and it seems to drop about 10 fps when I take a screenshot for some reason, but im not too concerned about the stats at the moment, i should be able to optimise it later if I need to, to get it running decently. Also ill be giving all the assets from my wip to the guys at the Ground Zero mod so you'll probably get hold of them fairly soon to use in your maps.

<br /><br />Im really just putting it in the game so that its ready for the ground zero mod, it'll have to be heavily modified to work I think, especially if we make it destructible.
<br />I was just going to keep it in max initially, just because it looks better, with alpha shadows and soft shadows and all that but I was advised to put it ingame for good reason;
<br />If I went for a job they'd want to see that I can work within the constraints of a game engine aswell as a 3d renderer.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p177670" date="Posted: Mon May 07, 2007 11:51 pm "><author>Bo$bevok</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">you're gonna make it all destructable?!?! ..... <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225090620im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p177672" date="Posted: Tue May 08, 2007 12:01 am "><author>heXum</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I don't think I've chimed in and said how impressive that stuff is.

<br />Its not showing the best fps there, nothing's optimised in regards to textures and it seems to drop about 10 fps when I take a screenshot for some reason, but im not too concerned about the stats at the moment, i should be able to optimise it later if I need to, to get it running decently.

<br /><br />Im really just putting it in the game so that its ready for the ground zero mod, it'll have to be heavily modified to work I think, especially if we make it destructible.

<br /><br />after I removed a bunch of the excessive branches, I got it down to about half though.
<br /><br />Since it's exporting to obj files, it's not harder to get it into Doom3, than it is to make any custom models for Doom3 really. (atleast it isn't for me, since I often use the export to obj function in Radiant to make the custom models seam up with the maps I've built)

<br /><br />I don´t know either because i´m sure that i´ve imported larger files with more polys and it worked. Anyway, i had to cut the branches into 4 different ase files.
<br />If i did not, the following would happen: I exported the ase, imported the ase and everything worked. Then i dmaped and this worked, too. When i then started the map doom would hang.

<br />Its not showing the best fps there, nothing's optimised in regards to textures and it seems to drop about 10 fps when I take a screenshot for some reason, but im not too concerned about the stats at the moment, i should be able to optimise it later if I need to, to get it running decently. Also ill be giving all the assets from my wip to the guys at the Ground Zero mod so you'll probably get hold of them fairly soon to use in your maps.

<br /><br />Im really just putting it in the game so that its ready for the ground zero mod, it'll have to be heavily modified to work I think, especially if we make it destructible.
<br />I was just going to keep it in max initially, just because it looks better, with alpha shadows and soft shadows and all that but I was advised to put it ingame for good reason;
<br />If I went for a job they'd want to see that I can work within the constraints of a game engine aswell as a 3d renderer.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p177670" date="Posted: Mon May 07, 2007 11:51 pm "><author>Bo$bevok</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">you're gonna make it all destructable?!?! ..... <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225090620im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p177672" date="Posted: Tue May 08, 2007 12:01 am "><author>heXum</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I don't think I've chimed in and said how impressive that stuff is.

<br />Its not showing the best fps there, nothing's optimised in regards to textures and it seems to drop about 10 fps when I take a screenshot for some reason, but im not too concerned about the stats at the moment, i should be able to optimise it later if I need to, to get it running decently. Also ill be giving all the assets from my wip to the guys at the Ground Zero mod so you'll probably get hold of them fairly soon to use in your maps.

<br />I was just going to keep it in max initially, just because it looks better, with alpha shadows and soft shadows and all that but I was advised to put it ingame for good reason;
<br />If I went for a job they'd want to see that I can work within the constraints of a game engine aswell as a 3d renderer.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p177670" date="Posted: Mon May 07, 2007 11:51 pm "><author>Bo$bevok</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">you're gonna make it all destructable?!?! ..... <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225084730im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p177672" date="Posted: Tue May 08, 2007 12:01 am "><author>heXum</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I don't think I've chimed in and said how impressive that stuff is.

<br /><br />Since it's exporting to obj files, it's not harder to get it into Doom3, than it is to make any custom models for Doom3 really. (atleast it isn't for me, since I often use the export to obj function in Radiant to make the custom models seam up with the maps I've built)

<br /><br />I don´t know either because i´m sure that i´ve imported larger files with more polys and it worked. Anyway, i had to cut the branches into 4 different ase files.
<br />If i did not, the following would happen: I exported the ase, imported the ase and everything worked. Then i dmaped and this worked, too. When i then started the map doom would hang.
<br /><br />&lt;edit&gt;the branches are at 40.000 polys.&lt;/edit&gt;</div>]]></body></post><post id="p174208" date="Posted: Mon Mar 26, 2007 1:03 am "><author>Kristus</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Intresting..

Alot of the foliage and grass is a uniform colour, and could benefit from just alittle more colour variation just like you have established in the brick work of your screenshot (a shader that reduces saturation and contrast with distance wouldn't go amiss aswell).&#13;<br /><br />A while ago I was looking at a piece of my own work and I noticed how my ivy was one shade of green and my tree leaves were a different shade of green.  I found the difference quite jaring, and I can see a similar thing going on here.&#13;<br /><br />Its just a suggestion but you could try making the warm yellowy green of the grass and tree leaves alittle closer to the cool bluish green of the creeping vine.  &#13;<br /><br />Then maybe you could introduce some of the bluish green colour into the grass and tree leaves, and put some of the warm yellowish green into the creeping vine.&#13;<br /><br />I very much like the contrast of the blue flowers against the overall orangyness of the scene.  Maybe you could make more of that relationship?  Some blue flower models? You could try a very subtle desaturated, dark, cool blue ambient light under the arches.&#13;<br /><br />Inspirational stuff.&#13;<br /><br />edit:  I think I can see a similar mix of warm yellowy green and cool bluish geen in the tree in this shot:-&#13;<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070922130650/http://img144.imageshack.us/my.php?image=shoreditchet8.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070922130650im_/http://img144.imageshack.us/img144/2742/shoreditchet8.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>&#13;<br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070922130650im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p160945" date="Posted: Sun Oct 29, 2006 4:18 am "><author>mikebart</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">cheers for the feedback guys <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070922130650im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br />modern, I really appreciate the tips, I see what your getting at with the two different greens, Im going to redo most of the plant life, alot of those plants are quite old and I think I can make them better now anyway.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p163320" date="Posted: Tue Nov 28, 2006 6:00 am "><author>Tron</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I'm curious, how much reuse of models is there in this level between different areas?

If you're going to be using realtime lights as well (as you would want when you're going to have objects like players which need to interact with the world) you don't want to go over the top with the pre-computer lighting though, just a bit of a subtle effect to fill out those dark spots.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p163326" date="Posted: Tue Nov 28, 2006 8:35 am "><author>mikebart</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">The building project's been put on hold for a while and I've been contributing my time to the dark mod for the last month or so, but ill get back into it eventually.&#13;<br /><br />Some of the models are duplicates, like some of the loose bricks and things and one half of each of the broken arches are the same model, the columns are duplicates too.&#13;<br /><br />Thats a great idea, If it were to be used for more distant structures you could build a low poly model around a group of low poly models like for example the damaged building model and project them to one large glow map, the same can be done for diffuse, spec and normals.

The only disadvantage to this aproach IMO is that theres not alot of tiling going on so these models are quite hungry on texture memory, but still, I like the effect.

The only disadvantage to this aproach IMO is that theres not alot of tiling going on so these models are quite hungry on texture memory, but still, I like the effect.

The only disadvantage to this aproach IMO is that theres not alot of tiling going on so these models are quite hungry on texture memory, but still, I like the effect.

The only disadvantage to this aproach IMO is that theres not alot of tiling going on so these models are quite hungry on texture memory, but still, I like the effect.

						<div class="postbody">I just made a quick test of it today. But the generator is not exactly very economic in it's use of polies. a small scrub, ended up at 4000 polies.&#13;<br /><br />after I removed a bunch of the excessive branches, I got it down to about half though.&#13;<br /><br />Since it's exporting to obj files, it's not harder to get it into Doom3, than it is to make any custom models for Doom3 really. (atleast it isn't for me, since I often use the export to obj function in Radiant to make the custom models seam up with the maps I've built)&#13;<br /><br />But since you're using Blender (right) I don't know how well it support the .obj format.</div>

						<div class="postbody">I just made a quick test of it today. But the generator is not exactly very economic in it's use of polies. a small scrub, ended up at 4000 polies.&#13;<br /><br />after I removed a bunch of the excessive branches, I got it down to about half though.&#13;<br /><br />Since it's exporting to obj files, it's not harder to get it into Doom3, than it is to make any custom models for Doom3 really. (atleast it isn't for me, since I often use the export to obj function in Radiant to make the custom models seam up with the maps I've built)&#13;<br /><br />But since you're using Blender (right) I don't know how well it support the .obj format.</div>

						<div class="postbody">I just made a quick test of it today. But the generator is not exactly very economic in it's use of polies. a small scrub, ended up at 4000 polies.&#13;<br /><br />after I removed a bunch of the excessive branches, I got it down to about half though.&#13;<br /><br />Since it's exporting to obj files, it's not harder to get it into Doom3, than it is to make any custom models for Doom3 really. (atleast it isn't for me, since I often use the export to obj function in Radiant to make the custom models seam up with the maps I've built)&#13;<br /><br />But since you're using Blender (right) I don't know how well it support the .obj format.</div>

						<div class="postbody">I just made a quick test of it today. But the generator is not exactly very economic in it's use of polies. a small scrub, ended up at 4000 polies.&#13;<br /><br />after I removed a bunch of the excessive branches, I got it down to about half though.&#13;<br /><br />Since it's exporting to obj files, it's not harder to get it into Doom3, than it is to make any custom models for Doom3 really. (atleast it isn't for me, since I often use the export to obj function in Radiant to make the custom models seam up with the maps I've built)&#13;<br /><br />But since you're using Blender (right) I don't know how well it support the .obj format.</div>

						<div class="postbody">I just made a quick test of it today. But the generator is not exactly very economic in it's use of polies. a small scrub, ended up at 4000 polies.&#13;<br /><br />after I removed a bunch of the excessive branches, I got it down to about half though.&#13;<br /><br />Since it's exporting to obj files, it's not harder to get it into Doom3, than it is to make any custom models for Doom3 really. (atleast it isn't for me, since I often use the export to obj function in Radiant to make the custom models seam up with the maps I've built)&#13;<br /><br />But since you're using Blender (right) I don't know how well it support the .obj format.</div>

Ill see how I go with that tron, its just that the time I spend exporting these models to doom3 and then tweaking things in the engine could be better spent building assets, I can usually predict how a model or a texture is going to look in doom3 anyway and I just dont feel the need to put them ingame at the moment but whatever engine I use ill always post my work here.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?p=160978#160978" target="_blank" class="postlink">Tutorial; Baking Multiple Maps in 3dsmax8. </a></span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

Its not showing the best fps there, nothing's optimised in regards to textures and it seems to drop about 10 fps when I take a screenshot for some reason, but im not too concerned about the stats at the moment, i should be able to optimise it later if I need to, to get it running decently. Also ill be giving all the assets from my wip to the guys at the Ground Zero mod so you'll probably get hold of them fairly soon to use in your maps.&#13;

Ill see how I go with that tron, its just that the time I spend exporting these models to doom3 and then tweaking things in the engine could be better spent building assets, I can usually predict how a model or a texture is going to look in doom3 anyway and I just dont feel the need to put them ingame at the moment but whatever engine I use ill always post my work here.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?p=160978#160978" target="_blank" class="postlink">Tutorial; Baking Multiple Maps in 3dsmax8. </a></span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

Its not showing the best fps there, nothing's optimised in regards to textures and it seems to drop about 10 fps when I take a screenshot for some reason, but im not too concerned about the stats at the moment, i should be able to optimise it later if I need to, to get it running decently. Also ill be giving all the assets from my wip to the guys at the Ground Zero mod so you'll probably get hold of them fairly soon to use in your maps.&#13;
