You have to put the artifact on top of the staff. Then you place the staff in the temple and the sun beams point to the location of the treasure.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p213835" date="Posted: Tue Apr 21, 2009 4:09 pm "><author>aardwolf</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">The Happy Friar wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">if you haven't watched how can you say they're crap?

I would agree that a lot Spielberg's stuff is mediocre, though.  I think an accurate description of him would be one of the better mainstream directors.  Talented, but generally keeps to a pretty basic formula and style.  Schindler's List was one of his few movies that broke his typical mold.  I honestly wish he'd do it more often.<br /><br />I will agree however that Der Untergang is a brilliant movie and its high up my list when it comes to WWII movies.</div>]]></body></post></posts></thread></xml>
