You certainly aren't above it.<br /><br />When I hear this, I think something like the looping main menu track. I mean if you heard Doom 3's menu music before you heard the actual theme, you'd say the same thing. However in retrospect you don't really think twice, do you?<br /><br />The question is, where did this crop up from and why are people convinced it's legit? Seriously what's the history here?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p237154" date="Posted: Sun Jan 15, 2012 10:15 pm "><author>mth</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">The guy uploaded tracks on his site: mick-gordon.com.
