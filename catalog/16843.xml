Anyway, I'm looking for ways to make:&#13;
<br/>
A rain emitting texture in QUAKE 4, &#13;
<br/>
Grass that sticks up in a 3D fashion w/o modelling, &#13;
<br/>
And how to make trees/bushes.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Any links/advice would be very much appreciated.&#13;

In fact I know of at least two threads (one so recent it's within the last week) that specifically discuss it.&#13;
<br/><br/>
For grass without modeling you have one other alternative, using textures that look like grass and use the alpha mask to clip it then just weave two or three patch meshes with this texture applied to make a grassy area.  Make sure to set the material to nonsolid though so that you can move through it.  This is an "old school" method but it's still fairly common.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Making trees and bushes is as simple as modeling them heh.  I mean, I can't really explain how to make them without explaining how to model with an editor.  Of all the things you can model, these are really fairly simple objects once you have the basics for modeling down.</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

<br/>
(in console type edit particles)&#13;
<br/><br/>
open one of the default drip particles and see how it works&#13;
<br/>
now redoo it so you have several drips   falling randomly&#13;
<br/><br/>
save your particle&#13;
<br/><br/>
create a new material in your mtr file&#13;
<br/>
here is what mine looks like&#13;
<br/>
textures/exhale2/rain_prt&#13;
<br/>
{&#13;
<br/>
deform particle rain_drip&#13;
<br/>
qer_editorimage textures/common/nodraw.tga&#13;
<br/>
nonsolid&#13;
<br/>
noshadows&#13;
<br/>
(&#13;
<br/>
blend filter&#13;
<br/>
map  _white&#13;
<br/>
}&#13;
<br/>
}&#13;
<br/>
the filter removes the white and since your mapping _white its basically not drawn all that is drawn is the deform particle  so now you have a drip particle that you can stretch over whatever area you need&#13;
<br/><br/>
portalling and optimizing is esential for rain without it you can have to many surfaces at once&#13;
<br/><br/>
grass&#13;
<br/><br/>
create a grass textures&#13;
<br/><br/><br/>
next you need the mtr&#13;
<br/>
textures/exhale2/grass&#13;
<br/>
{&#13;
<br/>
deform sprite&#13;
<br/>
twosided&#13;
<br/>
discrete&#13;
<br/>
(&#13;
<br/>
blend diffusemap&#13;
<br/>
map textures/******--your grass texture here&#13;
<br/>
centerscale (if needed) I did&#13;
<br/>
shear ( sound *0.3) + fol1Table[time*0.008],0     //this makes it move in synch with a sound (shear sound)  and the fol1Table is a table I made you could use a prebuilt one like sinTable and then just tweak the time and intensity&#13;
<br/>
alphatest 0.5&#13;
<br/>
alphaZeroClamp&#13;
<br/>
}&#13;
<br/>
}&#13;
<br/>
this works great for bushes   what you could try And Ive meant to try is to  use this mtr as a bassis for a particle   then use the same nodraw texture method to draw grass ( i would expect a big performance hit by trying this)&#13;
<br/><br/>
the other thing you could try is a flat texture that shears and has an animated heightmap to simulate grass movement  again something ive been meaning to try&#13;
<br/>
this material works best for bushes and trees though  since grass is so tightly cropped together You would have a ton of faces to illuminate??&#13;
<br/><br/><br/>
as for alphatest   what you are doing is defining what sections of a texture will be drawn and what sections wont&#13;
<br/><br/>
you do this in gimp or photoshop by createing an alpha layer and then drawing white where you want the texture to show and black where you dont&#13;
<br/>
the alpatest  command then says if its black I wont draw it white I will<br/>_________________<br/>it was bad enough imps and maggots everywhere but when that Hellknight copped a feel that was to much now I really was in hell</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

double click it to edit&#13;

make sure your view window is in realtime render mode&#13;

now every time you make a change to the material click test until it works&#13;

then click save&#13;

if your usure about whats wrong&#13;

look at the console window it will give an error everytime you test and something is wrong   the error will tell you how to fix the mtr<br/>_________________<br/>it was bad enough imps and maggots everywhere but when that Hellknight copped a feel that was to much now I really was in hell</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>
