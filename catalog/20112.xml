There's my box with the cage set correctly, and the boxs set inside the model to render. When I render, I see the diffuse map which is correct, but the bumpmap appear all blue. (That's better than the last time, the bump map was rendering the diffuse map o.0)<br /><br />The settings in the Render to Texture are :<br /><br />Projection : Enabled<br />Use Existing Coordinate, for both sub-level and the other.<br /><br />I added one map, Normal map, set as bump.<br /><br />And it doesnt work, it's starting to be really annoying, I tryed to attach every little box to make one model, didn't work, tryed different way to position things, switched between differents settings, well I thinks I tryed almost everything and it's still doesn't work. I mean what the hell is going on with that normal map renderer, it was working before...<br /><br />Hmm I will go check if the normal map of the old model still render...<br /><br />Yep, my old model still render their normal maps perfectly, so it doesnt come from settings I guess... The only difference is that one is on horizontal, and the other is vertical... I don't thinks it could change anything, I even tryed to move it on vertical, didn't change anything...<br /><br />Oh my god, those problems are real pain in the ***. There's probably somes little details I don't know and that are never shown in tutorials that can affect everything if done in another way.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p184026" date="Posted: Wed Jul 18, 2007 11:36 pm "><author>obihb</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Without actually looking at the Max file I can't say much, but for a guess it seems to me those boxes are just normal 90 degree boxes with no angles in the sides. Which basically means when the normal is rendered it's dead on 0 in which case you get blue color in the map.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p184031" date="Posted: Thu Jul 19, 2007 12:40 am "><author>iceheart</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Yes, looks like you have no slopes in your model, which is the only thing normalmaps record.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p184032" date="Posted: Thu Jul 19, 2007 1:05 am "><author>ShaZe</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Damnit, so it mean that if I want to do bump map that doesn't have any complicated form, I will need to make it manually or something like this? <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081204023520im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><br /><br />Thats's damn... this renderer should consider the space used within the cage to make the bump map <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081204023520im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p184033" date="Posted: Thu Jul 19, 2007 1:08 am "><author>iceheart</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I don't think you understand quite how normal maps work, I suggest you do some reading up on the subject and then you can understand why you're getting a solid blue render and what you can do to "fix" it.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p184037" date="Posted: Thu Jul 19, 2007 2:52 am "><author>ShaZe</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Yeah, I had realized that the height level was not taken in count, as if you compare two different level, they got the same color.
