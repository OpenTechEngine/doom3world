<br />iddevnet is a bit vague on where to install them, it says to install the game to a folder path without any spaces and suggests C:/Doom3 
<br />However the SDK is installed by default to that folder.
<br />So do you actually need to install both to the same folder?
<br />Or just the SDK?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p58233" date="Posted: Thu Oct 21, 2004 6:15 pm "><author>TTK-Bandit</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">my paths are g:\doom3\ for doom and g:\doom3\source\ for the code..

<br /><br />I installed the SDK into E:\Programme\Doom3SDK (E: being my default partition for apps) and the game to F:\Programme\Doom3 (F: being my default partition for games).
<br /><br />No problems with that. I only have to copy the DLL to the target directory, but you will have to do this anyways.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p58455" date="Posted: Fri Oct 22, 2004 5:23 pm "><author>TTK-Bandit</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Dante_uk wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I assume mod makers will need to build and pack both the gamex86.dll and the Linux gamex86.so ...</div>

<br /><br />The proper way is to put the dll in a pk4 with a binary.conf file and run that from your mod directory.
<br /><br />The way I (and I assume many others) end up testing is moving the dll to the mod directory and setting it to read-only, so when the game attempts to overwrite, it can't.
<br /><br />There's probably some great way to do that under windows, but I don't mind the copying.  I know people using linux have modified their scons to include all kinds of automation, automatically pk4-ing and moving the code, etc.
<br /><br /><br /><br />But to directly answer your question, you cannot run the code directly from VS, and it'd probably be counterproductive anyway, since you should be running from a mod directory anyway.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p169729" date="Posted: Tue Feb 06, 2007 4:27 am "><author>simic</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">what i mean is when I compile the code it asks me for an executable to run!
