The Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States played out through the entire decade. Due to the conservative norms of the era and the sometimes violent suppression of social movements, seeds of rebellion grew and were manifested through Rock and Roll, movies emphasizing rebelliousness, expansion of the Civil Rights Movement. Europe continued to be divided into free and Soviet bloc countries. The geographical point of this division came to be called the Iron Curtain. The bandas and the mafia saw a good opportunity of this split between East and West-Europe so they started a revolution. The bandas is a gang who doesn’t have any traditions, they are not against drugs, the mafia does and that’s why they also dislike the bandas. The Mafia doesn’t want that their traditions disappear and that’s why they also start an American mafia to expand.
