In this section you will find Last Man Standing Videos, including video of Alucard's maps that are to be included in 4.0!

The purpose of the project is to make it as easy as possible for people to create their own games.  Among other things it features in game map editing and co-op editing is supported!  Also it is open source and free!

It is entering the final testing stages and then it will be packaged and released.  I just wanted to say thanks to the community for your continued help and support.
