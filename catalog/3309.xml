<br /><br />Good tutorial though <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100522175616im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p31891" date="Posted: Tue Aug 10, 2004 7:58 am "><author>PsychoDad</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">The links to your tutorials aren't working.

<br /><br />And about audio, yes, that is a possibility, and I'm still thinking about it, I mean, the size would go up rather 'much', atleast some and so, but I think I'm gonna try some VT's with sounds and have like a poll.
<br /><br />Also, about the sounds, I'm gonna make a 'triggered explosion' Video Tutorial, that one will include triggering, particle effects and sounds <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100522175616im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Might do it tonight since I've been away for 2 days.
<br /><br />Glad you liked it, it's not really hard to figure out and I'm sure it was out at the forums already.
<br /><br />Also, I kinda did this in a rush, I usually take more breaks to show where the mouse is and show 'important' locations.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p42765" date="Posted: Fri Aug 27, 2004 3:08 pm "><author>MNeMiC</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">UPDATED WITH AUDIO!

<br /><br />Just a thought!   <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100522175616im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p42798" date="Posted: Fri Aug 27, 2004 4:47 pm "><author>MNeMiC</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">okey, sure thing, but wait, whats a damage sector? haha, it's good to know what it is before i start trying to make it =/
<br /><br />I will add it to my tutorial list tho, but I have to add sounds to the ones I have before I start on any new ones, so perhaps this weekend one or two new might be here =)</div>]]></body></post><post id="p58365" date="Posted: Fri Oct 22, 2004 3:56 am "><author>Agent Spork</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I think what he is referring to as a "damage sector" is basically a floor that does damage to you as you're standing on it. The term "damage sector" comes from the first 2 doom games. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100522175616im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p58374" date="Posted: Fri Oct 22, 2004 4:30 am "><author>abigserve</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Damge sector (trigr_hert):
<br />1. A set region in which to damage a player and or character.
<br />2. An immediate death region/area/spot.
<br />3. A small underground fungus created by small insects called BugServs, originally discovered by an parapleigic hermit working out of a cave somewhere in the alps.
