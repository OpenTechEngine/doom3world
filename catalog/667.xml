It turned out to be IMO the easiest modeling software to learn. There are plenty of tutorials on the web.
<br /><br />I found a site with some free video tutorials. I posted the link elsewhere here but I can't remember where. Check the videos out at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.simplylightwave.com/" class="postlink">SimplyLightwave.com</a>.
<br /><br />The videos are very in depth and Phillip does a great job explaining what he is doing.  If you have any questions you can post them on the site's forum. If you like the free tutorials and want more, for a small price you can purchase VIP points and download tutorials from the VIP section.
<br /><br />I am very happy with what I have learned and eventually decided to purchase some points because watching someone actually model something is much easier than trying to read a tutorial or a book.
<br /><br />Let me know what some of you think. The site is fairly new and I would like to see the site stick around for awhile. As long as there are plenty of people visiting it, it will.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p4780" date="Posted: Wed Feb 26, 2003 7:06 am "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks Rich!
