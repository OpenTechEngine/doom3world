Someone went into my ModDB profile and changed all the "categories" to "comedy", heheh.  Yeah, real funny.  I remember setting them as "sci-fi" and no one else should have access.  There were also a couple of files deleted apparently.  Nothing has happened since I changed my password but it's a worry, since this might mean they also get my password, which I do reuse on some other "low-security" sites.  Such a thing could be disasterous for someone else.  For me it was just a prank, it seems, but I thought I'd bring it up just incase.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p201629" date="Posted: Thu Jul 10, 2008 6:07 pm "><author>iceheart</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">The same thing happened for IC's page, I think it's just moddb's website upgrade that did it.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p201659" date="Posted: Fri Jul 11, 2008 5:36 am "><author>The Happy Friar</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">not sure what you mean by "categories".
