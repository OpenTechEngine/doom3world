Then again, it's really much much easier to set up a work permit for a non-swede than it is for a non-american to get a work visa. I lived in the US for 10 years and game companies there have a much larger pool of people to pick from domestically rather than bring people in from overseas and deal with the visa issues.

Then again, it's really much much easier to set up a work permit for a non-swede than it is for a non-american to get a work visa. I lived in the US for 10 years and game companies there have a much larger pool of people to pick from domestically rather than bring people in from overseas and deal with the visa issues. Unless one has a lot of experiences or something totally unique to offer it's a better bet to look at companies where you live.</div>]]></body></post></posts></thread></xml>
