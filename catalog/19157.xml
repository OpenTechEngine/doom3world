See README_Q4TV_broadcasting.txt for documentation&#13;<br /><br />* the multiplayer game now resides in q4mp/. The game will automatically&#13;<br />reload to fs_game q4mp when starting a multiplayer server or connecting to one.&#13;<br /><br />* si_fps server setting allows server administrators to customize the&#13;<br />game tick rate. Default is set to 60 fps, which is consistent with&#13;<br />previous releases. If set higher, server and clients will tick faster,&#13;<br />allowing for tighter input control and higher FPS.&#13;<br /><br />You have to make sure however that server and clients connected to the&#13;<br />game have enough CPU power to keep up. We recommend leaving this to LAN&#13;<br />and competition games only.&#13;<br /><br />* builtin HTTP server for autodownload. You have the option to serve the&#13;<br />files directly to the clients connecting to your server (in addition to&#13;<br />the seperate download server option from previous releases)&#13;<br />See README_builting_downloads.txt for documentation&#13;<br /><br />* improved shotgun spread, more regular pattern&#13;<br /><br />* railgun damage lowered to 90, start railgun ammo to 5&#13;<br /><br />* update napalm weapons code, tweak damage value and range of napalm ambers&#13;<br />updated sounds for napalm&#13;<br /><br />* added filtering by mod to the server browser&#13;<br /><br />* pak names are listed in the console when missing paks are required&#13;<br />to connect to a server&#13;<br /><br />* improve mapDef handling for addons&#13;<br />addons should only have a mapDef entry in addon.conf, but multiple declarations&#13;<br />(in def and addon declaration) are merged together&#13;<br /><br />* added r_ignoreHWGamma cvar&#13;<br /><br />* addition of net_clientUsercmdPacking. client-&gt;server traffic is sent&#13;<br />once every net_clientUsercmdPacking frames. This reduces the&#13;<br />client-&gt;server traffic, and increases the predict ahead slightly.&#13;<br />Setting is ignored for LAN games.&#13;<br />Pre 1.4 behaviour is net_clientUsercmdPacking 1&#13;<br /><br />* improved client-&gt;server user commands traffic&#13;<br />better predict ahead adjustment, and slightly smaller usercommand packet size&#13;<br /><br />* new ear seperation algorithm for stereo software sound, used by default in multiplayer only&#13;<br />see s_earSeperationAlgo, s_mp_minVolume, s_mp_maxWindow&#13;<br /><br />* made value overflows in idBitMsg::WriteBits into errors&#13;<br />improved bandwidth usage for ammo counts, and various other bandwidth improvements&#13;<br /><br />* callvote and admin menu map lists show the server's maps. clients&#13;<br />and admins can load server maps that are not on the client yet.&#13;<br /><br />* com_allowConsole -1 disables the console completely until the game&#13;<br />exits (or value changed via gamecode)&#13;<br /><br />* access to ingame browser from game code:&#13;<br />custom filters and access to serverinfo data&#13;<br /><br />* fixes to dropped sounds and stuck hum sounds&#13;<br /><br />* added player handicap (reduces max health, and reduces damage dealt)&#13;<br /><br />* warning don't get printed to the console anymore, unless you&#13;<br />enable developer 1&#13;<br /><br />* multiplayer uses 8-sided collision boxes by default&#13;<br /><br />* simple items drawn closer to the ground&#13;<br /><br />* GUIs for r_forceAmbient and g_simpleItems settings&#13;<br /><br />* fix networking of bound entities&#13;<br /><br />* add key and button state query API from the core for mods&#13;<br /><br />* extensions to the server&lt;-&gt;master protocol allow better&#13;<br />cross-platform multiplayer compatibility&#13;<br /><br />* Linux: fix console key on non-US keyboard layouts&#13;<br /><br />* add a game API for mods that want to implement bots&#13;<br /><br />* fix performance issues when switching between windowed mode when using OpenAL&#13;<br /><br />* fix local 'serverInfo' command when net_ip is used&#13;<br /><br />* add a 'listMaps' command to list maps for dedicated servers</div>]]></body></post><post id="p174955" date="Posted: Tue Apr 03, 2007 12:18 pm "><author>kat</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Wow, that's a lot of stuff!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p174964" date="Posted: Tue Apr 03, 2007 1:29 pm "><author>rich_is_bored</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">That was my first thought too. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p174991" date="Posted: Tue Apr 03, 2007 3:48 pm "><author>Mordenkainen</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Do ladders work in MP again?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p174999" date="Posted: Tue Apr 03, 2007 5:09 pm "><author>The Happy Friar</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Mordenkainen wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Do ladders work in MP again?</div>&#13;<br /><br />do you mean tourney ladders or climbing ladders?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p175006" date="Posted: Tue Apr 03, 2007 5:56 pm "><author>BloodRayne</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Wow.
