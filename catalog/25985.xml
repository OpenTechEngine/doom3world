No, absolutely no regrets. <br /></div><br /><br />If your talking about gaming the future really isn't black and white as what your describing. I will agree the tradiational style of PC games is probably going to go down at some point if not already, but we will see PC gaming evolve. The new kinect for example, which will have a higher resolution camera, and more joint/better skeletal tracking we can see more games using the new kinect than the old one. At a studio I worked out we were trying to come up with awesome mechanics using the kinect, well holding say your hand up in the form of a gun and acting like your pulling the trigger with your index finger. Well the problem is the current kinect doesn't support a high enough fluid resolution to track fingers. <br /><br />This is one of many possibilities, but you still have the line of sight issue with the kinect so well have to see how the new one plays out. The next possibility with PC gaming is going to be a few generations down the road, but take a look at this article <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319223959/http://www.theverge.com/2012/1/7/2688635/microsoft-research-vermeer-3d-hologram-">http://www.theverge.com/2012/1/7/268863 ... -hologram-</a><!-- m --> , Microsoft a few months ago actually made hologram, one that doesn't have to be projected on something. I picture in about 8-10 years we might see a "cyber zone" type thing and instead of laser tag you shoot the holograms, and years past that when it becomes cheap enough it might be able to be in your house. <br /><br />That holographic stuff might seem like it's far off but someone between now and the times I projected could come up with a cheap way to do holographic tech similar to how the kinect is a cheap mo-cap device. But you are correct we will probably see a decline in the traditional style PC games(probably around the same time console games will go down), but that doesn't mean PC gaming is dead, it's just going to evolve. Mobile devices still have a huge performance gap between their PC/console counterparts so with stuff like kinect and holographic tech we won't see mobile devices using this tech for at least 10-15 years after the tech becomes usuable. So don't expect your ipad running iOS 17 to beable to do holographic tech in your lifetime. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319223959im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />.<br /><br />Also check out Kinect Fusion<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319223959/http://www.neowin.net/news/build-2012-microsoft-shows-off-kinect-fusion">http://www.neowin.net/news/build-2012-m ... ect-fusion</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319223959/http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/surfacerecon/">http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/pro ... facerecon/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Fusion mixed with a head monted kinect or depth camera and kinect to detect the players movement you can do a lot with that.
