But the MD5 models that have been made for it were all done with Blender...<br /><br />I've tried converting from Skin to Physique to export to MD3, but the animations don't come out correctly.<br /><br />I found a method of recreating the skeleton with Bones then attaching them to the Biped and then reattaching the mesh to the bones.  But I have several models to work with, this would be tedious process...<br />Also found a similar way of converting the Biped to Bones, same problem though...<br /><br />Has anyone come up with a sane method to get Biped models from Max to MD5?<br /><br />I'm using Max6. I also have Max9.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p206665" date="Posted: Mon Oct 27, 2008 10:44 pm "><author>Brain Trepaning</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">If "tedious process"es bother you, you'd be best off leaving behind game modding as a hobby right about now.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p206667" date="Posted: Mon Oct 27, 2008 11:57 pm "><author>Kristus</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">bipped?<br />Anyway, after much searching indeed...  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121041419im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /><br /><br /><!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121041419/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=1914">viewtopic.php?t=1914</a><!-- l --><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121041419/http://www.trepaning.com/d3Vids/d3Vids.htm">http://www.trepaning.com/d3Vids/d3Vids.htm</a><!-- m --></div>]]></body></post></posts></thread></xml>
