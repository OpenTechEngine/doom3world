<br /><br />Funny? Not really.
<br /><br />Id didn't play much role in the developement of Prey. They just furnished an engine and provided support (much like what they're doing for Splashdamage with ETQW and Raven with Quake 4 before that). It's Humanhead and 3DRealms who did most of the work.

<br /><br /><br />A few random tidbit questions:
<br /><br /><ul>-Is it possible at all for users to transfer a store-bought copy of Prey to their Steam account, so that they could play from anywhere if they wanted?<br />-Is the Steam copy of Prey still moddable?

<br />I do hope that Valve gets their deal together though, I've been getting more and more disgusted with my Steam experience lately.

This is usually resolved by a benign restart of Steam, but it's still very disheartening to encounter such a ridiculous problem keeping track of the trivial list of my games (I can't see how, in 20 minutes, I can go from owning it to not-owning it, and that's a little scary).

<br /><br />Yes; you can register the key there and actually download it from Steam. Kinda like HL2. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320003606/http://www.3drealms.com/news/2006/11/prey_available_on_steam.html" class="postlink">More information here</a>.
<br /><br />Regarding modding, it's a good question, since steam games need it to be ran from the system. I think that's my major hurdle with steam... having to run everything FROM it instead of standalone. Even the icons it creates are just shortcuts to steam with a given game id to be ran on the command line.
<br /><br />I also tend to agree with what <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320003606/http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20061129/mcmaster_01.shtml" class="postlink">Scott Miller</a> thinks: that having Steam as a separate company would be better for other developers when selling through the system (albeit it's ironic that interview was just posted on the same day a game from his own company was announced on Steam).</div>]]></body></post><post id="p163600" date="Posted: Fri Dec 01, 2006 4:26 pm "><author>3j</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I guess I'm one of the few people that really likes Steam.

<br /><br />I think that your friend just need to make a constructive report to Steam Support and what ever else he can find to prouve that he's really owning that CD-Key...
<br /><br />So... screenshot, scan of his HL² box with cdkey, good resume in good english text of his problem, copy all things to his lawyer and send it to him, and say if it can't be resolve freindly he will take the justice of his country...

<br /><br />Id didn't play much role in the developement of Prey. They just furnished an engine and provided support (much like what they're doing for Splashdamage with ETQW and Raven with Quake 4 before that). It's Humanhead and 3DRealms who did most of the work.

<br /><br />Yes; you can register the key there and actually download it from Steam. Kinda like HL2. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320012004/http://www.3drealms.com/news/2006/11/prey_available_on_steam.html" class="postlink">More information here</a>.
<br /><br />Regarding modding, it's a good question, since steam games need it to be ran from the system. I think that's my major hurdle with steam... having to run everything FROM it instead of standalone. Even the icons it creates are just shortcuts to steam with a given game id to be ran on the command line.
<br /><br />I also tend to agree with what <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320012004/http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20061129/mcmaster_01.shtml" class="postlink">Scott Miller</a> thinks: that having Steam as a separate company would be better for other developers when selling through the system (albeit it's ironic that interview was just posted on the same day a game from his own company was announced on Steam).</div>]]></body></post><post id="p163600" date="Posted: Fri Dec 01, 2006 4:26 pm "><author>3j</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I guess I'm one of the few people that really likes Steam.
