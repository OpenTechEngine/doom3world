<br /><br />I'm playing on a Intel E6700 system, 2GB RAM, Nvidia 8800GTX 768mb, Vista Ultimate, onboard sound, Samsung 24 inch full HD monitors.
<br />The game runs very smooth in 1600 resolution with everything maxed out (exception - anti aliasing). So far no hickup, crash or whatever problem occurred.
