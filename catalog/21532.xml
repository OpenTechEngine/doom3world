I also liked the area where you just spawned in about 12 imps, it was pretty fun. This is also the first time i've had to punch an hk to death. <br /><br />you have alot of potential if you just put a little more time into the detail of some of the maps - not that i can talk, i haven't released anything yet.<br /><br />overall i really enjoyed it but it just felt like there needed to be some more work done.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p199295" date="Posted: Tue May 20, 2008 6:36 pm "><author>Skul</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">striderdm1 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">i finally got some time to play it yesterday.

If so, there's a big stock of shells to the left of the yellow keycard locked door. You should also find a massive amount of ammo in Map 4 if you find the blue keycard.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">striderdm1 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Anyhow, played through. Loved it overall...then i got my ass kicked on the last map! Damn! lol</div><br />Map 8 can vary in difficulty. If you play on Easy, you'll have infinite stamina, on Medium, there'll be an adrenaline booster on the left and right of the map, behind the pillars and on Hard... well, you'll have to use your stamina wisely.<br /><br />By the way, did you find the secret level? If so, how was it?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">striderdm1 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Great work - make more <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081120231340im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div><br />Well, if you insist... <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081120231340im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Tetzlaff wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I remember playing a beta version of your level pack.

Map 1 has had a few extra decorative pillars, Map 4 has had a couple of tweaks in monster placement and terms of cover in the cell block and Map 5 now has the entrance to the secret level.<br /><br />Stay on your toes for a couple of extra things, as well.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p199345" date="Posted: Wed May 21, 2008 9:56 pm "><author>Tetzlaff</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Skul wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">Tetzlaff wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">...

I need to check it out. And that "growing an extra finger" - must be an odd experience <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081120191115im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /> .

If you play on Easy, you'll have infinite stamina, on Medium, there'll be an adrenaline booster on the left and right of the map, behind the pillars and on Hard... well, you'll have to use your stamina wisely.<br /><br />By the way, did you find the secret level? If so, how was it?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">striderdm1 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Great work - make more <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081120191115im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div><br />Well, if you insist... <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081120191115im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">Tetzlaff wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I remember playing a beta version of your level pack.

I need to check it out. And that "growing an extra finger" - must be an odd experience <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081120191115im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /> . Anyways, Tetlaz is kind of a guidepost for me. Whatever he says, I tend to heed. I definitely am going to check Death Rebellion for myself. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081120191115im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p205265" date="Posted: Wed Sep 24, 2008 3:35 am "><author>Skul</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Sorry to bump this, but as it turns out, there are a couple of problems, like GUIs not showing up and the credits not playing. If anyone had this problem, they should have said.<br /><br />Anyway, the update's links are on the first post.<br /><br />Plus, I've given a couple of maps some subtle changes for better gameplay. Hopefully, the Hellknight you have to fistfight won't sometimes accidentally kill itself in the fire. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081120190135im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /> Plus the secret level's entrance is a little more obvious.<br /><br />All right, then. Later!</div>]]></body></post></posts></thread></xml>
