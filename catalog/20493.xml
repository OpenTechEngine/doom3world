But ET: QW seems to eventually smooth out once people figure it out, at least that's what happened in the Beta. Once everyone had a chance to familiarize themselves with the game, most servers were filled with players that generally knew what to do. Jobs were getting done as needed. I also always saw significant changes in behavior and skill of players after Splash Damage released their map walk-throughs, like the valley's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081204105644/http://community.enemyterritory.com/index.php?q=node/111" class="postlink">"Strollin' Soldier" guide</a>. After that went up on the website, I actually started to see people following that guide in-game.<br /><br />But the demo released, and these people playing, I think, are new players that didn't play the beta. I just got off the game after playing for 2-3 hours, and I see a lot of n00bs just standing around, no doubt trying to figure the game out. As with all multi-player games, especially more complex ones (and ET: QW is pretty complex), I think players just need time to figure it out. And with a team-based games you can really only enjoy the game if your teammates know how to play.<br /><br />I also see a lot of people giving their first impressions of the demo. People saying "This game is awesome!" or "This game sucks", obvious signs of they just downloaded it...</div>]]></body></post><post id="p188169" date="Posted: Mon Sep 10, 2007 9:31 pm "><author>BloodRayne</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Gazado wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Pub servers are normally like that for most popular FPS, you either learn to deal with it or play as part of a community where people are regulars on a forum with their own private server for those forum goers (works like a clan, but without having to play seriously, just for fun) - alternativly join a clan to get that kind of teamwork your looking for.<br /><br />Either way, the beta was like that when it was first released but it sorted itself over time as the community calmed down.

Still easier for me then to fire up Q3 and join the old servers to meet some old mates. <br /><br />But for the game, seriously quality all around, very well executed.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081204105644im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p188182" date="Posted: Tue Sep 11, 2007 2:04 am "><author>zeh</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Every game is like that.

Here's how I'd change them to make them useful and be less of a chore:<br /><br />Before you started hacking, you'd have to choose which type of hack you'd do and where it would happen (front line?  Outpost? etc.).  The instant that you entered the control center, the enemy would be alerted of a breach, giving them a chance to stop you.  If they didn't, this would be the consequence:<br /><br />- Reinforcments:  No one spawns at <span style="font-style: italic">one</span> spawn point of the hacker's choice for 45 seconds.  Anyone who wanted to spawn would be forced to do so at a different location, the default being one spawnpoint behind the "Frontline" if frontline hack was chosen, or, if a player has chosen the same location as the hacker for spawning, they'd be forced to the Frontline.<br /><br />- No deployables: No deployables possible for any "dropper" class for 45 seconds.<br /><br />I'd remove the Vehicle drop choice, as that's not terribly useful <span style="font-style: italic">unless</span> it also impacted vehicle respawns at a location for a period of time.  I'd make the impact be 1 minute for these.<br /><br />To me, the balance <span style="font-style: italic">and</span> removal of the chore aspect would be simple:<br /><br />Hacking the command post killed you.<br /><br />At the start of the hack, a countermeasure sequence starts that is just slightly slower than the time it takes to perform the hack.  Within a second of a successful hack, the countermeasure kills you, and the center goes into a lock-down mode for a specified time.  This would ensure a side can't be disabled and hacked repeatedly.  For example, the command centers can only be hacked once per game or at an interval, like once every 10 minutes.  <br /><br />This would remove the "chore" of having the hacked side go kill the hacker... if a side didn't stop them in time, they would have to deal with the aftermath of the intrusion... but the hacker couldn't keep disabling spawns or vehicles over and over.<br /><br />It could still be a great boon to the hacker's team, though, worth doing if done right, but the costs, I think, would be comparable to the potential advantage gain.</div><br />I'd love to see those assets too. Now's the time to start raising the subject on the official etqw forums since they should be putting the sdk together soon ( I suspect just after the 1.2 patch is released ).</div>]]></body></post><post id="p188988" date="Posted: Sat Sep 22, 2007 10:23 pm "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">very interesting.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">goliathvt wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Actually I think it'd be interesting if SD left these available in the source/full release</div><br />with the concept ideas that you guys have demonstrated here, it seems that the community could quite easily think of uses for the stuff that sd took out, so it makes sense to me that those assets be given to the community to use in our maps.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p188989" date="Posted: Sat Sep 22, 2007 10:36 pm "><author>The Happy Friar</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I see ET:QW as TF, ET, UT Assault &amp; CnC:Renegade all in one.

Here's how I'd change them to make them useful and be less of a chore:<br /><br />Before you started hacking, you'd have to choose which type of hack you'd do and where it would happen (front line?  Outpost? etc.).  The instant that you entered the control center, the enemy would be alerted of a breach, giving them a chance to stop you.  If they didn't, this would be the consequence:<br /><br />- Reinforcments:  No one spawns at <span style="font-style: italic">one</span> spawn point of the hacker's choice for 45 seconds.  Anyone who wanted to spawn would be forced to do so at a different location, the default being one spawnpoint behind the "Frontline" if frontline hack was chosen, or, if a player has chosen the same location as the hacker for spawning, they'd be forced to the Frontline.<br /><br />- No deployables: No deployables possible for any "dropper" class for 45 seconds.<br /><br />I'd remove the Vehicle drop choice, as that's not terribly useful <span style="font-style: italic">unless</span> it also impacted vehicle respawns at a location for a period of time.  I'd make the impact be 1 minute for these.<br /><br />To me, the balance <span style="font-style: italic">and</span> removal of the chore aspect would be simple:<br /><br />Hacking the command post killed you.<br /><br />At the start of the hack, a countermeasure sequence starts that is just slightly slower than the time it takes to perform the hack.  Within a second of a successful hack, the countermeasure kills you, and the center goes into a lock-down mode for a specified time.  This would ensure a side can't be disabled and hacked repeatedly.  For example, the command centers can only be hacked once per game or at an interval, like once every 10 minutes.  <br /><br />This would remove the "chore" of having the hacked side go kill the hacker... if a side didn't stop them in time, they would have to deal with the aftermath of the intrusion... but the hacker couldn't keep disabling spawns or vehicles over and over.<br /><br />It could still be a great boon to the hacker's team, though, worth doing if done right, but the costs, I think, would be comparable to the potential advantage gain.</div><br />I'd love to see those assets too. Now's the time to start raising the subject on the official etqw forums since they should be putting the sdk together soon ( I suspect just after the 1.2 patch is released ).</div>]]></body></post><post id="p188150" date="Posted: Mon Sep 10, 2007 5:17 pm "><author>goliathvt</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">You can download the demo on all the major sites...

But ET: QW seems to eventually smooth out once people figure it out, at least that's what happened in the Beta. Once everyone had a chance to familiarize themselves with the game, most servers were filled with players that generally knew what to do. Jobs were getting done as needed. I also always saw significant changes in behavior and skill of players after Splash Damage released their map walk-throughs, like the valley's <a href="/web/20081204110710/http://community.enemyterritory.com/index.php?q=node/111" class="postlink">"Strollin' Soldier" guide</a>. After that went up on the website, I actually started to see people following that guide in-game.<br /><br />But the demo released, and these people playing, I think, are new players that didn't play the beta. I just got off the game after playing for 2-3 hours, and I see a lot of n00bs just standing around, no doubt trying to figure the game out. As with all multi-player games, especially more complex ones (and ET: QW is pretty complex), I think players just need time to figure it out. And with a team-based games you can really only enjoy the game if your teammates know how to play.<br /><br />I also see a lot of people giving their first impressions of the demo. People saying "This game is awesome!" or "This game sucks", obvious signs of they just downloaded it...</div>]]></body></post><post id="p188169" date="Posted: Mon Sep 10, 2007 9:31 pm "><author>BloodRayne</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Gazado wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Pub servers are normally like that for most popular FPS, you either learn to deal with it or play as part of a community where people are regulars on a forum with their own private server for those forum goers (works like a clan, but without having to play seriously, just for fun) - alternativly join a clan to get that kind of teamwork your looking for.<br /><br />Either way, the beta was like that when it was first released but it sorted itself over time as the community calmed down.

But you can see from that pic that's not all they've changed. The polygon (shadow casting even) newspapers were replaced with low-rez decals and they've removed those purty bottles. Unlike the exagerated bloom, these kinds of detail props did improve graphics by not making the ground look so barren. The MT is of lower quality in that shot, they probably didn't yet have the detail texture mask.<br /><br />Anyway, if you want to see Bloom in action I suggest you look at the GDF's HQ model and switch between r_megadrawmethod 0 and 3 and you can see the faint orange sheen around it goes away in the lower quality setting.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p188941" date="Posted: Fri Sep 21, 2007 10:33 pm "><author>Dante_uk</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Biggest thing I miss from the early shots is the footage from the original trailers were you see inside the command post with the big maps &amp; computer screens etc.<br />Plus vehicle driving out of transporters.

And now we know why the Strogg can hack to the GDF base, but there's no point to doing it.<br /><br />With those bases it sounded a LOT more like CnC:Renegade.  you could purchases better classes/weapons/vehicles.<br /><br />I would of loved the command centers.  Here's my "work around".  There's AP guns inside &amp; AP/AV guns outside.  When you hack you become normal.  If you don't hack defenses the guns shoot at you.  If you have full health, or there's a distraction guy with you (IE someone else to shoot at) you can hack (you'll die if you stay).  Lasts for 30 seconds.  Baddies can't get in to base anymore because it's "locked down" &amp; are basically stuck.  when everything re-activated, they get slaughtered.  No reason to truck back unless you want to "repair" the systems just like you can remove mines, explosives, turrets, etc.  But just like temporarily disabled equipment (hacked or EMP'ed) it's back in in 30 seconds.<br /><br />would be awesome in an object based map as you defend the control room.

For example, the command centers can only be hacked once per game or at an interval, like once every 10 minutes.  <br /><br />This would remove the "chore" of having the hacked side go kill the hacker... if a side didn't stop them in time, they would have to deal with the aftermath of the intrusion... but the hacker couldn't keep disabling spawns or vehicles over and over.<br /><br />It could still be a great boon to the hacker's team, though, worth doing if done right, but the costs, I think, would be comparable to the potential advantage gain.</div><br />I'd love to see those assets too. Now's the time to start raising the subject on the official etqw forums since they should be putting the sdk together soon ( I suspect just after the 1.2 patch is released ).</div>]]></body></post><post id="p188150" date="Posted: Mon Sep 10, 2007 5:17 pm "><author>goliathvt</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">You can download the demo on all the major sites...

But ET: QW seems to eventually smooth out once people figure it out, at least that's what happened in the Beta. Once everyone had a chance to familiarize themselves with the game, most servers were filled with players that generally knew what to do. Jobs were getting done as needed. I also always saw significant changes in behavior and skill of players after Splash Damage released their map walk-throughs, like the valley's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081204110710/http://community.enemyterritory.com/index.php?q=node/111" class="postlink">"Strollin' Soldier" guide</a>. After that went up on the website, I actually started to see people following that guide in-game.<br /><br />But the demo released, and these people playing, I think, are new players that didn't play the beta. I just got off the game after playing for 2-3 hours, and I see a lot of n00bs just standing around, no doubt trying to figure the game out. As with all multi-player games, especially more complex ones (and ET: QW is pretty complex), I think players just need time to figure it out. And with a team-based games you can really only enjoy the game if your teammates know how to play.<br /><br />I also see a lot of people giving their first impressions of the demo. People saying "This game is awesome!" or "This game sucks", obvious signs of they just downloaded it...</div>]]></body></post><post id="p188169" date="Posted: Mon Sep 10, 2007 9:31 pm "><author>BloodRayne</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Gazado wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Pub servers are normally like that for most popular FPS, you either learn to deal with it or play as part of a community where people are regulars on a forum with their own private server for those forum goers (works like a clan, but without having to play seriously, just for fun) - alternativly join a clan to get that kind of teamwork your looking for.<br /><br />Either way, the beta was like that when it was first released but it sorted itself over time as the community calmed down.

But you can see from that pic that's not all they've changed. The polygon (shadow casting even) newspapers were replaced with low-rez decals and they've removed those purty bottles. Unlike the exagerated bloom, these kinds of detail props did improve graphics by not making the ground look so barren. The MT is of lower quality in that shot, they probably didn't yet have the detail texture mask.<br /><br />Anyway, if you want to see Bloom in action I suggest you look at the GDF's HQ model and switch between r_megadrawmethod 0 and 3 and you can see the faint orange sheen around it goes away in the lower quality setting.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p188941" date="Posted: Fri Sep 21, 2007 10:33 pm "><author>Dante_uk</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Biggest thing I miss from the early shots is the footage from the original trailers were you see inside the command post with the big maps &amp; computer screens etc.<br />Plus vehicle driving out of transporters.

And now we know why the Strogg can hack to the GDF base, but there's no point to doing it.<br /><br />With those bases it sounded a LOT more like CnC:Renegade.  you could purchases better classes/weapons/vehicles.<br /><br />I would of loved the command centers.  Here's my "work around".  There's AP guns inside &amp; AP/AV guns outside.  When you hack you become normal.  If you don't hack defenses the guns shoot at you.  If you have full health, or there's a distraction guy with you (IE someone else to shoot at) you can hack (you'll die if you stay).  Lasts for 30 seconds.  Baddies can't get in to base anymore because it's "locked down" &amp; are basically stuck.  when everything re-activated, they get slaughtered.  No reason to truck back unless you want to "repair" the systems just like you can remove mines, explosives, turrets, etc.  But just like temporarily disabled equipment (hacked or EMP'ed) it's back in in 30 seconds.<br /><br />would be awesome in an object based map as you defend the control room.

But ET: QW seems to eventually smooth out once people figure it out, at least that's what happened in the Beta. Once everyone had a chance to familiarize themselves with the game, most servers were filled with players that generally knew what to do. Jobs were getting done as needed. I also always saw significant changes in behavior and skill of players after Splash Damage released their map walk-throughs, like the valley's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081204110710/http://community.enemyterritory.com/index.php?q=node/111" class="postlink">"Strollin' Soldier" guide</a>. After that went up on the website, I actually started to see people following that guide in-game.<br /><br />But the demo released, and these people playing, I think, are new players that didn't play the beta. I just got off the game after playing for 2-3 hours, and I see a lot of n00bs just standing around, no doubt trying to figure the game out. As with all multi-player games, especially more complex ones (and ET: QW is pretty complex), I think players just need time to figure it out. And with a team-based games you can really only enjoy the game if your teammates know how to play.<br /><br />I also see a lot of people giving their first impressions of the demo. People saying "This game is awesome!" or "This game sucks", obvious signs of they just downloaded it...</div>]]></body></post><post id="p188169" date="Posted: Mon Sep 10, 2007 9:31 pm "><author>BloodRayne</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Gazado wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Pub servers are normally like that for most popular FPS, you either learn to deal with it or play as part of a community where people are regulars on a forum with their own private server for those forum goers (works like a clan, but without having to play seriously, just for fun) - alternativly join a clan to get that kind of teamwork your looking for.<br /><br />Either way, the beta was like that when it was first released but it sorted itself over time as the community calmed down.

But you can see from that pic that's not all they've changed. The polygon (shadow casting even) newspapers were replaced with low-rez decals and they've removed those purty bottles. Unlike the exagerated bloom, these kinds of detail props did improve graphics by not making the ground look so barren. The MT is of lower quality in that shot, they probably didn't yet have the detail texture mask.<br /><br />Anyway, if you want to see Bloom in action I suggest you look at the GDF's HQ model and switch between r_megadrawmethod 0 and 3 and you can see the faint orange sheen around it goes away in the lower quality setting.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p188941" date="Posted: Fri Sep 21, 2007 10:33 pm "><author>Dante_uk</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Biggest thing I miss from the early shots is the footage from the original trailers were you see inside the command post with the big maps &amp; computer screens etc.<br />Plus vehicle driving out of transporters.

And now we know why the Strogg can hack to the GDF base, but there's no point to doing it.<br /><br />With those bases it sounded a LOT more like CnC:Renegade.  you could purchases better classes/weapons/vehicles.<br /><br />I would of loved the command centers.  Here's my "work around".  There's AP guns inside &amp; AP/AV guns outside.  When you hack you become normal.  If you don't hack defenses the guns shoot at you.  If you have full health, or there's a distraction guy with you (IE someone else to shoot at) you can hack (you'll die if you stay).  Lasts for 30 seconds.  Baddies can't get in to base anymore because it's "locked down" &amp; are basically stuck.  when everything re-activated, they get slaughtered.  No reason to truck back unless you want to "repair" the systems just like you can remove mines, explosives, turrets, etc.  But just like temporarily disabled equipment (hacked or EMP'ed) it's back in in 30 seconds.<br /><br />would be awesome in an object based map as you defend the control room.

For example, the command centers can only be hacked once per game or at an interval, like once every 10 minutes.  <br /><br />This would remove the "chore" of having the hacked side go kill the hacker... if a side didn't stop them in time, they would have to deal with the aftermath of the intrusion... but the hacker couldn't keep disabling spawns or vehicles over and over.<br /><br />It could still be a great boon to the hacker's team, though, worth doing if done right, but the costs, I think, would be comparable to the potential advantage gain.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p188988" date="Posted: Sat Sep 22, 2007 10:23 pm "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">very interesting.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">goliathvt wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Actually I think it'd be interesting if SD left these available in the source/full release</div><br />with the concept ideas that you guys have demonstrated here, it seems that the community could quite easily think of uses for the stuff that sd took out, so it makes sense to me that those assets be given to the community to use in our maps.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p188989" date="Posted: Sat Sep 22, 2007 10:36 pm "><author>The Happy Friar</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I see ET:QW as TF, ET, UT Assault &amp; CnC:Renegade all in one.

For example, the command centers can only be hacked once per game or at an interval, like once every 10 minutes.  <br /><br />This would remove the "chore" of having the hacked side go kill the hacker... if a side didn't stop them in time, they would have to deal with the aftermath of the intrusion... but the hacker couldn't keep disabling spawns or vehicles over and over.<br /><br />It could still be a great boon to the hacker's team, though, worth doing if done right, but the costs, I think, would be comparable to the potential advantage gain.</div><br />I'd love to see those assets too. Now's the time to start raising the subject on the official etqw forums since they should be putting the sdk together soon ( I suspect just after the 1.2 patch is released ).</div>]]></body></post></posts></thread></xml>
