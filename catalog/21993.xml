Unfortunately, ascii images won't fly in this class. The general outline of this course is to use type as an artform. While, no doubt, detailed ascii images can look great, the stuff we have to make are like those highly decorated ad posters with the text warping and rotating to fit within an artistic theme--similar to what graphic designers do. Besides, the image has to be grayscale. That means I would have to manipulate the kerning and leading (horizontal spacing and vertical spacing, respectively) to pull of the illusion of darker values, which I don't think Notepad or Wordpad can do (or can it?).<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">The Happy Friar wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">In theory, the image could be traced with vectors in gimp/p-shop, then just draw with a character as the brush for the fonts vs the way it was done for this image.
