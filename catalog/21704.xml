Nothing out of the ordinary, I went to the carnival, All three of the children rode some of the big kid rides and they all had fun, I rode on the big wheel that spins around and makes you stick to the wall for the first time in my life, it was actually pretty fun except it felt like my face was melting. My oldest son had the magic touch, he won every carnival game he played, he looked like a pirate with all the stuffed animals and hats he won, he was the only one to win the "break the beer bottle with the baseball" game all weekend they told us.  Afterwards we had a cookout, ate some BBQ pork steak and burgers, potato salad and beans. <br /><br />Then we watched the fireworks, this was the second time I went to Henry Illinois to watch them, they shoot them right over the Illinois river which is a tributary of the Mississippi, They shoot the rockets off on one side of the river and the spectators sit on the other, the reflections on the water are very pretty, you can feel the blast and heat, and they are so close it looks like they cover the whole sky. I was thinking about what it would have been like back in 1776 or later on the day the revolution was won, and remembering all the past great accomplishments of our country, I still believe in America, even though America right now is'nt my kind of America I believe in change. <br /><br />After that we went to my sisters house everyone got drunk except me I don't drink, I just played my guitar and watched everyone, it was very entertaining and fun. It was a good time, one of my favorite holidays of the year besides Halloween. Anyone else have a good time yesterday? What did you do?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p201339" date="Posted: Sat Jul 05, 2008 7:44 pm "><author>wal</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">How is it selfish? Sounds like a great day.

The kids went in the bouncehouse, then we watch some soap box car races, then we went to the farm (that burned down) &amp; worked for a few hours.  Came home, had dinner, then we all went to the fireworks.  Don't know what happened but they had some blow up w/o shooting up, some go ~20 feet then fall to the earth &amp; some explode pretty close (~50-75 feet) to the ground.  But it's the first time in ~8 years there's been fireworks in town so it's all good.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081116080610im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081116080610/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080705/ap_on_re_us/america_s_bad_mood">http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080705/ap_ ... s_bad_mood</a><!-- m --><br /><br />maybe I'm just all fk'ed up.
