Sadly they went kaputt (thanks BNA!) so I'm back to local music files. It's hard to pick a favourite and (like music in general) depends on my mood and what I'm doing. Planescape: Torment music is great for relaxing. I often map listening to either Diablo II or Halo. Castlevania (especially IV's) and Ultima's are beatiful. UT Classic has some great music, DOOM, heck, there's really too many to just pick one.   <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081115220542im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p206981" date="Posted: Fri Oct 31, 2008 5:37 pm "><author>Burrito</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Mafia<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081115220542/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICSsRUvKyY&amp;feature=related">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICSsRUv ... re=related</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Homeworld<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081115220542/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPxLqlDmJ8c&amp;feature=related">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPxLqlDm ... re=related</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Outlaws<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081115220542/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leX9GLacmUU&amp;feature=related">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leX9GLac ... re=related</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Descent 2<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081115220542/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQCLZjyg07M">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQCLZjyg07M</a><!-- m --></div>]]></body></post><post id="p206982" date="Posted: Fri Oct 31, 2008 5:39 pm "><author>iceheart</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Cannon Fodder <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081115220542im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p206986" date="Posted: Fri Oct 31, 2008 7:14 pm "><author>6th Venom</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">By the way, GUN had great unsuspected musics too!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p206988" date="Posted: Fri Oct 31, 2008 7:19 pm "><author>Douglas Quaid</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">The first PC game I owned was Command and Conquer Red Alert and I have always enjoyed listening to Hellmarch while training.
