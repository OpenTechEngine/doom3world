<br/><br/>
For example:&#13;
<br/>
I have made a 256x256 pixel texture which fits on a 128x128 units large face in the game. This is all good.&#13;
<br/>
I also made a 256x128 pixel texture which in turn fits on a 128x64 unit face. This is also good.&#13;
<br/><br/>
The thing that confuses me is that when I made a 512x512 pixel texture I thought it would corespond to 256x256 units.&#13;
<br/>
Instead the game shrinks the texture down to 128x128 units. Also a 128x128 pixel texture that I thought would corespond to 64x64 units instead is expanded up to 128x128 units.&#13;
<br/><br/>
I have messed around a little with different texture dimensions and I can't find any logic in how textures pixel dimensions scale to the units in the game.&#13;
<br/><br/>
If there is a way to keep the 2 pixels = 1 unit relationship for all these textures that would be great.&#13;
<br/>
I have used the "guide textures/... generic_shader(...)" command in my material file. &#13;
<br/><br/>
I have searched the forum and different sites for an explanation without getting any wiser so if anyone could point me in the right directon or give me some insight on how this works that would be great.</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

The site is in swedish but just write the 3 letters in the field in the upper right corner by the download button.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Anyway, the texture is 512x512 pixels but in the game it still gets shrunk down to 128x128 units.&#13;
<br/><br/>
ps. Feel free to comment on the texture itself as well. It's one of the first I made. <img src="/web/20061013024322im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0"/></span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

I always think d3 didn't handle textures under 24bits, but i can be wrong.&#13;

Except that, all look right, even your texture looking good.  <img src="/web/20061013024322im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0"/><br/>_________________<br/>I just wanna make something not made...</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

The texture is for quake 4 though. I'm not sure if there's a difference between the games. It's the same engine, right?&#13;
<br/><br/>
Anyway, I thought the height and specular maps where supposed to be in grey scale. I might be wrong though so maybe someone can enlighten me on that point as well. <img src="/web/20061013024322im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0"/><br/><br/>

Use the specular to add very subtle hints of color.
