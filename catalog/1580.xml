<br /><br />The road to the perfecto bolognaise !
<br /><br />This is a tough road I'm embarking on - one frought with legend, heresay and solid evidence.
<br />But I need to travel that road of the cooking mind in my quest for "the perfect bolognaise", or, as it is traditionally known, <span style="font-weight: bold">ragu</span> !
<br /><br />To start, it has to be clearly stated that there is no real 'bolognaise' perfect dish - it always has and always will be open to interpretation.
<br /><br />To all intents and purposes, the bolognaise is nothing more than a stew with some meat in it - a treat for the poor of Italy some centuries past and for many years, a treat for much of the rest of the western world. Explaining that bolognaise is indeed a paupers dish is a bit like managing to miss the whoopee cushion and landing a very tasty pie in the face.
<br /><br />If you can figure that one out, your doing better than I am.
<br /><br />But it's what you do with it that gets the taste buds going - not the pie or cushion - the dish itself is a marvel !
<br /><br />There's something very special about the bolognaise - the vegetables and herbs are so critical to the success that one often forgets the meat, which is indeed, probably a good thing !
<br /><br />So long as you've got some fleshy meat of any kind, you can make bolognaise.
<br /><br />The meat, while intrinsically important, is nothing more that the carrier of the flavour - the sauce !
<br /><br />The most important thing that bolognaise has is contained in the concept of that sauce.
<br /><br />So, to make a good bolognaise we need moisture, and the best moisture for cooking is wine !
<br /><br />The Basic Ragu - serves two
<br />===========================
<br /><br />1 large sprig rosemary - about a tablespoon when chopped loosley
<br />2 tin of tomatoes or 3 fresh tomatoes chopped
<br />3 1/2 an onion finely chopped
<br />4 1/2 teaspoon fresh chopped garlic
<br />5 salt and pepper to taste
<br />6 some meat - if your hungry, about 600g for two, otherwise 500 to 300g depending on your diet.
<br />7 Olive oil - if you like cooking, you must have and need olive oil in the house - use it at will !
<br />8 Oreganum
<br />9 half a big glass of red wine (190ml)
<br />10 pinch of sugar per person eating.
<br />11 fresh basil and thyme for decoration and added flavour.
<br /><br />Method
<br /><br />Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in pan.
<br />Add rosemary and fry for a few seconds.
<br />Add garlic and fry for a few seconds. (note, you can add this after the onions too if you want for a more garlically flavour)
<br />Add onion and fry for two minutes
<br />Add meat - at this point, you have to almost stir-fry the meat, trying to get it all cooked evenly  - maybe 5 to 8 minutes
<br />When 90% of the meat is lightly browned, add the red wine and cook till the wine fumes evapourate
<br />add in your Oreganum, tomatoes and mushrooms
<br />add salt and pepper to taste
<br />Add the pinches of sugar - a pinch is like 1/5 of a teaspoon.
<br />cover and simmer for 30 minutes.
<br />During simmering, add more wine if bolognaise is dry.
<br />Before serving add extra herbs like fresh basil or thyme if you want.
<br /><br />What you do after that is up to you - a nice salad and glass of dry white or red wine with some garlic bread is highly reccomended.
<br /><br />The quest for the perfect bolognaise, or should we say Ragu, continues !</div>]]></body></post><post id="p14074" date="Posted: Fri Oct 10, 2003 7:21 pm "><author>krankymonkee</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Very nice, I am hungry just reading, will have to try your steps sometime.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p14081" date="Posted: Fri Oct 10, 2003 9:05 pm "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Try to add the garlic last instead of first.
<br /><br />Garlic is very sensible to heat, so it'll taste better when you put it in during the stage where the bolognaise is just cooking idle.

<br />so, you dont eat it with spaghetty?
<br />really, a good fish or steak is an art.
<br />but i think i'll give one of these recipies a try.
<br />for meat, what do you think, ground beef, or pork?
<br /><br />bb: 1 tin doesnt help, ounces would. and do we want peeled? sliced? chopped?
<br />oreganum=oregano?
<br />and for sugar, if this is like a spaghatti sauce, i find that honey is the best sweetener.
<br />and olive oil: you like vergin, extra vergin, or light?
<br />and i dont have red wine, anything i could use to substitute?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p14118" date="Posted: Sat Oct 11, 2003 8:16 am "><author>bb_matt</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">It's pretty much open to interpretation how you prepare it.
<br /><br />For two people, I'd say 3 small italian tomatoes are good.
<br /><br />Olive oil - extra virgin is always best, but it's also damn expensive.
<br /><br />If you don't have red wine, you can add half a teaspoon of balsamic vinegar (be carefuly how much you add)
<br /><br />Thanks for the tip about the garlic BNA - and a bit of a history lesson !
<br /><br />Another cool addition is chopped bacon, which you can fry with rosemary before adding the onions.
<br /><br />The best meat is beef - ground beef is called mince in the UK, south africa, australia and new zealand.
<br /><br />Some people advocate getting a really cheap cut of meat of the bone and getting your butcher to grind that - cheap meat of the bone has the best flavour, but it's also the toughest, when it's ground you won't notice it.
<br /><br />There's a million ways to make a Ragu - this is just one of them and it's really tasty - it's hard to go wrong.
<br /><br />Sometimes it's great when it's got tons of tomatoes - that's more of a spagettit sauce.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p14119" date="Posted: Sat Oct 11, 2003 8:25 am "><author>Qwertys</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">so i guess you eat it with garlic bread, french bread, or sourdough bread?

<br /><br />Get yourself some good parmesan cheese (which I refer to as smelly-sock-cheese)
<br /><br />I'll have to introduce everyone to another great recipie that I've perfected - a chicken tagine - but it's really complicated and uses like 25 different ingredients, one of which is preserved lemons ! - it's pretty exotic and is a moroccan dish, but it's damn tasty. At least 30 minutes preparation time tho. The name is a bit misleading as a Tagine is a special pottery caserol dish - it's got a conical lid.
<br /><br />And then there's the curry I've finally got down perfect, with the help of Magic Masala, Garam masala and freshly chopped coriander leaves - tastes totally authentic. It's taken me 10 years to get to the point of making a curry worthy of an indian restaurant !</div>]]></body></post><post id="p14140" date="Posted: Sat Oct 11, 2003 3:53 pm "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Soon enough I'll conquer the world with my overy simple yet perfect tasting Risotto!

If you cook a whole clove (always works well roasted then the garlic is v sweet (and v tasty), you get more vampire repelant from crushed garlic in case antone is having problems with the living dead. 
<br /><br />is a must as is the wine, raises glass.
<br />freash chilli's are also needed, if you get an extreamly strong one it's possible to get the flavour just by slitting the chilli and removing it from the sauce once it's got it's required head, remember chilli does get hotter the more you cook it.
<br /><br />It's also a good point to know that the quality of the mince does make a big difference I always try to go for the steak mince although my girlfriend will tell you different. A bad workman always blames his tools, bah, that phrase is nonsence steak v crappy fatty meat that leaves horrid orange oil on the top of your bol is not what's needed here. for the perfect Bol I would recommend the finest steakmice from a decent local butchers.

This is my first post here and I'm italian, so maybe I can help a bit (-:
<br />I don't eat ragu' 'cause I'm vegetarian, but I've eated it so much in past, and my grandmother's continuing to do it.
<br />I've not personally ever cooked ragu' on my own, but I'm pretty sure that the garlic is not present at all.
<br />Secondly, the *real* ragu' does not cook for only 30 minutes, but for 3-4 hours at least.
<br /><br />Ragu' is not a spaghetti sauce. Here in italy we're not use it on spaghetti, but on other type of pasta that sets off his taste, like lasagne or tortelloni.
<br />Tortelloni is a real simple recipe to do, it's a pasta full of 'ricotta' cheese and spinach. If you want to hear more just tell me (-:
<br />Hoping I've raised your appetite (-:

<br /><br />I've variated my original bolognaise recipie somewhat since this original post.
<br />I use a bit more rosemary, and a few pinches of treacle sugar (that dark sticky sugar) - I'm also putting in more olive oil and cutting the onions up incredibly fine.
<br /><br />Interesting about the ragu there Pinhead - I want to try make a veg one that I'll cook for some hours.
<br /><br />I'm also cooking lasagne, but that takes a bit longer - my cheese sauce is totally decadant too, I use full cream, cheddar and parmesan and don't bother with any kinda flour in it  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224172801im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /><br /><br />BTW, edited my original recipie - forgot to mention I usually put the rosemary in at the very beggining.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p50716" date="Posted: Thu Sep 16, 2004 1:11 pm "><author>Pinhead from Outer Space</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Ok, I asked to my grandmother and she said that you can use grinded beef or pork either. Maybe there are two different school of thought here.
<br />She said also that there's no sugar nor treacle (or anyway she don't use it).
<br />For a vegetarian-like ragu' I use some vegetables (carrots, onions, etc...), some spices, and a soya-based compound that I buy at my vegetarian shop of choice.
<br /><br />Yeah, lasagne is a long and not so easy to do stuff. I suggest you to buy the preparation in a shop for the pasta, and then using ragu', bechamel and parmesan as seasoning before cooking it in you oven.
<br /><br />Ok, and now Tortelloni with ragu':
<br />take the flour, set it on your table of work and make a hole in the centre, so it's look like a volcano. Put one eggs (per 100gr of flour) in the hole and a bit of salt and start mixing with a fork at the beginning and with your hands after a while. Continue to work the kneading until it will be smooth and compact (if you need, you can strew you table of work with flour to avoid the mixing to stick on the table). Now just leave it under a cloth for a while.
<br />Well, congratulations, you've done your first egg-based pasta (-:
<br />Prepare the filling: grind some parmesan and put it with come ricotta cheese, salt and spinach (the spinach must be cooked and grinded of course) and mix them.
<br />Now you've to stretch tha pasta and cut it in squares. Put a nut of filling in the middle of the squre and close it on itself. Now you've a triangle. Close every side of the triangle and then join the vertex of the base turning them around your index. It's more difficult saying than doing it.
<br />Ok, now you've got your pasta, cook it and season it with your home-made ragu' (-:
<br />Good appetite!
<br /><br /><br />ps. here you can find some pics, although is written in italian.

<br /><br />Amen to tossing in red wine... in my mind, that's what seperates the good sauces from the mediocre.  
<br /><br />And yup, the holy trinity--olive oil, onions, garlic--always have their place in just about every pasta dish I've ever made.
<br /><br />Also, I agree with both BNA and matt about the garlic... that is, I usually sautee some with onions and olive oil... and then add a bit more when the whole thing is done, simmering, and mixing flavors.

<br /><br />Serving 4 people, or a hungry gamer for 2 nights
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What you need</span>
<br /><br />1 tablespoon oil, take your pick, verign, veg, etc
<br />1 med onion, sliced
<br />1 clove garlic - FRESH
<br />3 rashers rinless bacon, sliced into chuncks
<br />1 1/2 cups of button muchsrooms - sliced. You can use the big ones, but buttons have more flavor for this
<br />1 x 410 Gram can of cream of chicken, or cream of chicken and mushroom soup. I like to use Campbells, but not every one can get this brand, so use a quilty soup
<br />1/2 cup of watter
<br />350 Grams of Fettuccine, cooked and drained - I like to use Barilla, or Zafarelli, but use what you like, even fresh pasta, as above
<br />Parmesan Chesse for that extra zing
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">How to make it</span>
<br /><br />1. Heat oil in a medium sauce pan, and cook onion, garlic, bacon, and mushroom, untill tender.
<br /><br />2. Add soup and watter, then simmer for 5 mins
<br /><br />3. Pour soup mixture over hot Fettuccine, then add your chesse
<br /><br />Enjoy!
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">NOTES</span>
<br /><br />Though this is for Fettuccine, you can use a scoop pasta, such as elbos, as well, though this is not for a Spegetiy pasta
<br /><br />When we cook this, we normaly put 1/4 cup of mixed veg on the plate as well, becuase the meal has no vitavams, other then the shrooms

<br />Eheheh, you've to leave the pasta drying after you've filled it. And then cook it as any other pasta that you buy in the shop. But this home-made one is quicker to cook. Just put it in boiling water with an handful of salt, and when the pasta come on the surface, leave it another 1/2 minutes and then strain it. Happy cooking! (-:
<br /><br /><br />goliathvt:
<br />I don't know if you're referring to italian pasta dishes, but here we almost never use oil, onions and garlic in combo. The most famous receipt that use garlic and oil maybe is Spaghetti with garlic, oil and chilli. Just take an handful of spaghetti, cook it as usual, strain it and then season it with olive oil, garlic's fresh pieces and istantly-grinded chilli as you want. (-:
<br />It's a great easy-making combo!

This is my first post here and I'm italian, so maybe I can help a bit (-:
<br />I don't eat ragu' 'cause I'm vegetarian, but I've eated it so much in past, and my grandmother's continuing to do it.
<br />I've not personally ever cooked ragu' on my own, but I'm pretty sure that the garlic is not present at all.
<br />Secondly, the *real* ragu' does not cook for only 30 minutes, but for 3-4 hours at least.
<br /><br />Ragu' is not a spaghetti sauce. Here in italy we're not use it on spaghetti, but on other type of pasta that sets off his taste, like lasagne or tortelloni.
<br />Tortelloni is a real simple recipe to do, it's a pasta full of 'ricotta' cheese and spinach. If you want to hear more just tell me (-:

<br /><br />I've variated my original bolognaise recipie somewhat since this original post.
<br />I use a bit more rosemary, and a few pinches of treacle sugar (that dark sticky sugar) - I'm also putting in more olive oil and cutting the onions up incredibly fine.
<br /><br />Interesting about the ragu there Pinhead - I want to try make a veg one that I'll cook for some hours.
<br /><br />I'm also cooking lasagne, but that takes a bit longer - my cheese sauce is totally decadant too, I use full cream, cheddar and parmesan and don't bother with any kinda flour in it  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224172801im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /><br /><br />BTW, edited my original recipie - forgot to mention I usually put the rosemary in at the very beggining.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p50716" date="Posted: Thu Sep 16, 2004 1:11 pm "><author>Pinhead from Outer Space</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Ok, I asked to my grandmother and she said that you can use grinded beef or pork either. Maybe there are two different school of thought here.
<br />She said also that there's no sugar nor treacle (or anyway she don't use it).
<br />For a vegetarian-like ragu' I use some vegetables (carrots, onions, etc...), some spices, and a soya-based compound that I buy at my vegetarian shop of choice.
<br /><br />Yeah, lasagne is a long and not so easy to do stuff. I suggest you to buy the preparation in a shop for the pasta, and then using ragu', bechamel and parmesan as seasoning before cooking it in you oven.
<br /><br />Ok, and now Tortelloni with ragu':
<br />take the flour, set it on your table of work and make a hole in the centre, so it's look like a volcano. Put one eggs (per 100gr of flour) in the hole and a bit of salt and start mixing with a fork at the beginning and with your hands after a while. Continue to work the kneading until it will be smooth and compact (if you need, you can strew you table of work with flour to avoid the mixing to stick on the table). Now just leave it under a cloth for a while.
<br />Well, congratulations, you've done your first egg-based pasta (-:
<br />Prepare the filling: grind some parmesan and put it with come ricotta cheese, salt and spinach (the spinach must be cooked and grinded of course) and mix them.
<br />Now you've to stretch tha pasta and cut it in squares. Put a nut of filling in the middle of the squre and close it on itself. Now you've a triangle. Close every side of the triangle and then join the vertex of the base turning them around your index. It's more difficult saying than doing it.
<br />Ok, now you've got your pasta, cook it and season it with your home-made ragu' (-:
<br />Good appetite!

<br /><br />Also, I agree with both BNA and matt about the garlic... that is, I usually sautee some with onions and olive oil... and then add a bit more when the whole thing is done, simmering, and mixing flavors.

<br /><br />Serving 4 people, or a hungry gamer for 2 nights
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What you need</span>
<br /><br />1 tablespoon oil, take your pick, verign, veg, etc
<br />1 med onion, sliced
<br />1 clove garlic - FRESH
<br />3 rashers rinless bacon, sliced into chuncks
<br />1 1/2 cups of button muchsrooms - sliced. You can use the big ones, but buttons have more flavor for this
<br />1 x 410 Gram can of cream of chicken, or cream of chicken and mushroom soup. I like to use Campbells, but not every one can get this brand, so use a quilty soup
<br />1/2 cup of watter
<br />350 Grams of Fettuccine, cooked and drained - I like to use Barilla, or Zafarelli, but use what you like, even fresh pasta, as above
<br />Parmesan Chesse for that extra zing
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">How to make it</span>
<br /><br />1. Heat oil in a medium sauce pan, and cook onion, garlic, bacon, and mushroom, untill tender.
<br /><br />2. Add soup and watter, then simmer for 5 mins
<br /><br />3. Pour soup mixture over hot Fettuccine, then add your chesse
<br /><br />Enjoy!
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">NOTES</span>
<br /><br />Though this is for Fettuccine, you can use a scoop pasta, such as elbos, as well, though this is not for a Spegetiy pasta
<br /><br />When we cook this, we normaly put 1/4 cup of mixed veg on the plate as well, becuase the meal has no vitavams, other then the shrooms

<br />I don't know if you're referring to italian pasta dishes, but here we almost never use oil, onions and garlic in combo. The most famous receipt that use garlic and oil maybe is Spaghetti with garlic, oil and chilli.

<br /><br />The road to the perfecto bolognaise !
<br /><br />This is a tough road I'm embarking on - one frought with legend, heresay and solid evidence.
<br />But I need to travel that road of the cooking mind in my quest for "the perfect bolognaise", or, as it is traditionally known, <span style="font-weight: bold">ragu</span> !
<br /><br />To start, it has to be clearly stated that there is no real 'bolognaise' perfect dish - it always has and always will be open to interpretation.
<br /><br />To all intents and purposes, the bolognaise is nothing more than a stew with some meat in it - a treat for the poor of Italy some centuries past and for many years, a treat for much of the rest of the western world. Explaining that bolognaise is indeed a paupers dish is a bit like managing to miss the whoopee cushion and landing a very tasty pie in the face.
<br /><br />If you can figure that one out, your doing better than I am.
<br /><br />But it's what you do with it that gets the taste buds going - not the pie or cushion - the dish itself is a marvel !
<br /><br />There's something very special about the bolognaise - the vegetables and herbs are so critical to the success that one often forgets the meat, which is indeed, probably a good thing !
<br /><br />So long as you've got some fleshy meat of any kind, you can make bolognaise.
<br /><br />The meat, while intrinsically important, is nothing more that the carrier of the flavour - the sauce !
<br /><br />The most important thing that bolognaise has is contained in the concept of that sauce.
<br /><br />So, to make a good bolognaise we need moisture, and the best moisture for cooking is wine !
<br /><br />The Basic Ragu - serves two
<br />===========================
<br /><br />1 large sprig rosemary - about a tablespoon when chopped loosley
<br />2 tin of tomatoes or 3 fresh tomatoes chopped
<br />3 1/2 an onion finely chopped
<br />4 1/2 teaspoon fresh chopped garlic
<br />5 salt and pepper to taste
<br />6 some meat - if your hungry, about 600g for two, otherwise 500 to 300g depending on your diet.
<br />7 Olive oil - if you like cooking, you must have and need olive oil in the house - use it at will !
<br />8 Oreganum
<br />9 half a big glass of red wine (190ml)
<br />10 pinch of sugar per person eating.
<br />11 fresh basil and thyme for decoration and added flavour.
<br /><br />Method
<br /><br />Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in pan.
<br />Add rosemary and fry for a few seconds.
<br />Add garlic and fry for a few seconds. (note, you can add this after the onions too if you want for a more garlically flavour)
<br />Add onion and fry for two minutes
<br />Add meat - at this point, you have to almost stir-fry the meat, trying to get it all cooked evenly  - maybe 5 to 8 minutes
<br />When 90% of the meat is lightly browned, add the red wine and cook till the wine fumes evapourate
<br />add in your Oreganum, tomatoes and mushrooms
<br />add salt and pepper to taste
<br />Add the pinches of sugar - a pinch is like 1/5 of a teaspoon.
<br />cover and simmer for 30 minutes.
<br />During simmering, add more wine if bolognaise is dry.
<br />Before serving add extra herbs like fresh basil or thyme if you want.
<br /><br />What you do after that is up to you - a nice salad and glass of dry white or red wine with some garlic bread is highly reccomended.
<br /><br />The quest for the perfect bolognaise, or should we say Ragu, continues !</div>]]></body></post><post id="p14074" date="Posted: Fri Oct 10, 2003 8:21 pm "><author>krankymonkee</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Very nice, I am hungry just reading, will have to try your steps sometime.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p14081" date="Posted: Fri Oct 10, 2003 10:05 pm "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Try to add the garlic last instead of first.

<br /><br />bb: 1 tin doesnt help, ounces would. and do we want peeled? sliced? chopped?
<br />oreganum=oregano?
<br />and for sugar, if this is like a spaghatti sauce, i find that honey is the best sweetener.

<br /><br />For two people, I'd say 3 small italian tomatoes are good.
<br /><br />Olive oil - extra virgin is always best, but it's also damn expensive.
<br /><br />If you don't have red wine, you can add half a teaspoon of balsamic vinegar (be carefuly how much you add)
<br /><br />Thanks for the tip about the garlic BNA - and a bit of a history lesson !
<br /><br />Another cool addition is chopped bacon, which you can fry with rosemary before adding the onions.
<br /><br />The best meat is beef - ground beef is called mince in the UK, south africa, australia and new zealand.
<br /><br />Some people advocate getting a really cheap cut of meat of the bone and getting your butcher to grind that - cheap meat of the bone has the best flavour, but it's also the toughest, when it's ground you won't notice it.
<br /><br />There's a million ways to make a Ragu - this is just one of them and it's really tasty - it's hard to go wrong.
<br /><br />Sometimes it's great when it's got tons of tomatoes - that's more of a spagettit sauce.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p14119" date="Posted: Sat Oct 11, 2003 9:25 am "><author>Qwertys</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">so i guess you eat it with garlic bread, french bread, or sourdough bread?

<br /><br />I'll have to introduce everyone to another great recipie that I've perfected - a chicken tagine - but it's really complicated and uses like 25 different ingredients, one of which is preserved lemons ! - it's pretty exotic and is a moroccan dish, but it's damn tasty.

<br /><br />And then there's the curry I've finally got down perfect, with the help of Magic Masala, Garam masala and freshly chopped coriander leaves - tastes totally authentic.

<br /><br />It's also a good point to know that the quality of the mince does make a big difference I always try to go for the steak mince although my girlfriend will tell you different. A bad workman always blames his tools, bah, that phrase is nonsence steak v crappy fatty meat that leaves horrid orange oil on the top of your bol is not what's needed here. for the perfect Bol I would recommend the finest steakmice from a decent local butchers.
<br /><br />BTW, hows the diet going Matt, hope your fine &amp; well, missed you during the last stage of the texture challenge, I took over the last stage of the challenge so please send me whatever files you want to submit is at all &amp; I'll erm, submit them.

This is my first post here and I'm italian, so maybe I can help a bit (-:
<br />I don't eat ragu' 'cause I'm vegetarian, but I've eated it so much in past, and my grandmother's continuing to do it.
<br />I've not personally ever cooked ragu' on my own, but I'm pretty sure that the garlic is not present at all.
<br />Secondly, the *real* ragu' does not cook for only 30 minutes, but for 3-4 hours at least.
<br /><br />Ragu' is not a spaghetti sauce. Here in italy we're not use it on spaghetti, but on other type of pasta that sets off his taste, like lasagne or tortelloni.
<br />Tortelloni is a real simple recipe to do, it's a pasta full of 'ricotta' cheese and spinach. If you want to hear more just tell me (-:

<br /><br />I've variated my original bolognaise recipie somewhat since this original post.
<br />I use a bit more rosemary, and a few pinches of treacle sugar (that dark sticky sugar) - I'm also putting in more olive oil and cutting the onions up incredibly fine.
<br /><br />Interesting about the ragu there Pinhead - I want to try make a veg one that I'll cook for some hours.
<br /><br />I'm also cooking lasagne, but that takes a bit longer - my cheese sauce is totally decadant too, I use full cream, cheddar and parmesan and don't bother with any kinda flour in it  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224170625im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /><br /><br />BTW, edited my original recipie - forgot to mention I usually put the rosemary in at the very beggining.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p50716" date="Posted: Thu Sep 16, 2004 1:11 pm "><author>Pinhead from Outer Space</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Ok, I asked to my grandmother and she said that you can use grinded beef or pork either. Maybe there are two different school of thought here.
<br />She said also that there's no sugar nor treacle (or anyway she don't use it).
<br />For a vegetarian-like ragu' I use some vegetables (carrots, onions, etc...), some spices, and a soya-based compound that I buy at my vegetarian shop of choice.
<br /><br />Yeah, lasagne is a long and not so easy to do stuff. I suggest you to buy the preparation in a shop for the pasta, and then using ragu', bechamel and parmesan as seasoning before cooking it in you oven.
<br /><br />Ok, and now Tortelloni with ragu':
<br />take the flour, set it on your table of work and make a hole in the centre, so it's look like a volcano. Put one eggs (per 100gr of flour) in the hole and a bit of salt and start mixing with a fork at the beginning and with your hands after a while. Continue to work the kneading until it will be smooth and compact (if you need, you can strew you table of work with flour to avoid the mixing to stick on the table). Now just leave it under a cloth for a while.
<br />Well, congratulations, you've done your first egg-based pasta (-:
<br />Prepare the filling: grind some parmesan and put it with come ricotta cheese, salt and spinach (the spinach must be cooked and grinded of course) and mix them.
<br />Now you've to stretch tha pasta and cut it in squares. Put a nut of filling in the middle of the squre and close it on itself. Now you've a triangle. Close every side of the triangle and then join the vertex of the base turning them around your index. It's more difficult saying than doing it.
<br />Ok, now you've got your pasta, cook it and season it with your home-made ragu' (-:
<br />Good appetite!

<br /><br />1 tablespoon oil, take your pick, verign, veg, etc
<br />1 med onion, sliced
<br />1 clove garlic - FRESH
<br />3 rashers rinless bacon, sliced into chuncks
<br />1 1/2 cups of button muchsrooms - sliced. You can use the big ones, but buttons have more flavor for this
<br />1 x 410 Gram can of cream of chicken, or cream of chicken and mushroom soup. I like to use Campbells, but not every one can get this brand, so use a quilty soup
<br />1/2 cup of watter
<br />350 Grams of Fettuccine, cooked and drained - I like to use Barilla, or Zafarelli, but use what you like, even fresh pasta, as above
<br />Parmesan Chesse for that extra zing
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">How to make it</span>
<br /><br />1. Heat oil in a medium sauce pan, and cook onion, garlic, bacon, and mushroom, untill tender.
<br /><br />2. Add soup and watter, then simmer for 5 mins
<br /><br />3. Pour soup mixture over hot Fettuccine, then add your chesse
<br /><br />Enjoy!
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">NOTES</span>
<br /><br />Though this is for Fettuccine, you can use a scoop pasta, such as elbos, as well, though this is not for a Spegetiy pasta
<br /><br />When we cook this, we normaly put 1/4 cup of mixed veg on the plate as well, becuase the meal has no vitavams, other then the shrooms

<br />Eheheh, you've to leave the pasta drying after you've filled it. And then cook it as any other pasta that you buy in the shop. But this home-made one is quicker to cook.

<br />I don't know if you're referring to italian pasta dishes, but here we almost never use oil, onions and garlic in combo. The most famous receipt that use garlic and oil maybe is Spaghetti with garlic, oil and chilli. Just take an handful of spaghetti, cook it as usual, strain it and then season it with olive oil, garlic's fresh pieces and istantly-grinded chilli as you want. (-:

<br /><br />Aye, what pinead said. The "authentic" recipe I have (not the one I have used, I might add) starts cooking the day before, with slow reduction/disolution of the meat joint into a baking tin shallow with with water.

<br /><br />The road to the perfecto bolognaise !
<br /><br />This is a tough road I'm embarking on - one frought with legend, heresay and solid evidence.
<br />But I need to travel that road of the cooking mind in my quest for "the perfect bolognaise", or, as it is traditionally known, <span style="font-weight: bold">ragu</span> !
<br /><br />To start, it has to be clearly stated that there is no real 'bolognaise' perfect dish - it always has and always will be open to interpretation.
<br /><br />To all intents and purposes, the bolognaise is nothing more than a stew with some meat in it - a treat for the poor of Italy some centuries past and for many years, a treat for much of the rest of the western world. Explaining that bolognaise is indeed a paupers dish is a bit like managing to miss the whoopee cushion and landing a very tasty pie in the face.
<br /><br />If you can figure that one out, your doing better than I am.
<br /><br />But it's what you do with it that gets the taste buds going - not the pie or cushion - the dish itself is a marvel !
<br /><br />There's something very special about the bolognaise - the vegetables and herbs are so critical to the success that one often forgets the meat, which is indeed, probably a good thing !
<br /><br />So long as you've got some fleshy meat of any kind, you can make bolognaise.
<br /><br />The meat, while intrinsically important, is nothing more that the carrier of the flavour - the sauce !
<br /><br />The most important thing that bolognaise has is contained in the concept of that sauce.
<br /><br />So, to make a good bolognaise we need moisture, and the best moisture for cooking is wine !
<br /><br />The Basic Ragu - serves two
<br />===========================
<br /><br />1 large sprig rosemary - about a tablespoon when chopped loosley
<br />2 tin of tomatoes or 3 fresh tomatoes chopped
<br />3 1/2 an onion finely chopped
<br />4 1/2 teaspoon fresh chopped garlic
<br />5 salt and pepper to taste
<br />6 some meat - if your hungry, about 600g for two, otherwise 500 to 300g depending on your diet.
<br />7 Olive oil - if you like cooking, you must have and need olive oil in the house - use it at will !
<br />8 Oreganum
<br />9 half a big glass of red wine (190ml)
<br />10 pinch of sugar per person eating.
<br />11 fresh basil and thyme for decoration and added flavour.
<br /><br />Method
<br /><br />Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in pan.
<br />Add rosemary and fry for a few seconds.
<br />Add garlic and fry for a few seconds. (note, you can add this after the onions too if you want for a more garlically flavour)
<br />Add onion and fry for two minutes
<br />Add meat - at this point, you have to almost stir-fry the meat, trying to get it all cooked evenly  - maybe 5 to 8 minutes
<br />When 90% of the meat is lightly browned, add the red wine and cook till the wine fumes evapourate
<br />add in your Oreganum, tomatoes and mushrooms
<br />add salt and pepper to taste
<br />Add the pinches of sugar - a pinch is like 1/5 of a teaspoon.
<br />cover and simmer for 30 minutes.
<br />During simmering, add more wine if bolognaise is dry.
<br />Before serving add extra herbs like fresh basil or thyme if you want.
<br /><br />What you do after that is up to you - a nice salad and glass of dry white or red wine with some garlic bread is highly reccomended.
<br /><br />The quest for the perfect bolognaise, or should we say Ragu, continues !</div>]]></body></post><post id="p14074" date="Posted: Fri Oct 10, 2003 7:21 pm "><author>krankymonkee</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Very nice, I am hungry just reading, will have to try your steps sometime.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p14081" date="Posted: Fri Oct 10, 2003 9:05 pm "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Try to add the garlic last instead of first.

<br />for meat, what do you think, ground beef, or pork?
<br /><br />bb: 1 tin doesnt help, ounces would. and do we want peeled? sliced? chopped?
<br />oreganum=oregano?
<br />and for sugar, if this is like a spaghatti sauce, i find that honey is the best sweetener.

<br /><br />For two people, I'd say 3 small italian tomatoes are good.
<br /><br />Olive oil - extra virgin is always best, but it's also damn expensive.
<br /><br />If you don't have red wine, you can add half a teaspoon of balsamic vinegar (be carefuly how much you add)
<br /><br />Thanks for the tip about the garlic BNA - and a bit of a history lesson !
<br /><br />Another cool addition is chopped bacon, which you can fry with rosemary before adding the onions.
<br /><br />The best meat is beef - ground beef is called mince in the UK, south africa, australia and new zealand.
<br /><br />Some people advocate getting a really cheap cut of meat of the bone and getting your butcher to grind that - cheap meat of the bone has the best flavour, but it's also the toughest, when it's ground you won't notice it.
<br /><br />There's a million ways to make a Ragu - this is just one of them and it's really tasty - it's hard to go wrong.
<br /><br />Sometimes it's great when it's got tons of tomatoes - that's more of a spagettit sauce.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p14119" date="Posted: Sat Oct 11, 2003 8:25 am "><author>Qwertys</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">so i guess you eat it with garlic bread, french bread, or sourdough bread?

<br /><br />The road to the perfecto bolognaise !
<br /><br />This is a tough road I'm embarking on - one frought with legend, heresay and solid evidence.
<br />But I need to travel that road of the cooking mind in my quest for "the perfect bolognaise", or, as it is traditionally known, <span style="font-weight: bold">ragu</span> !
<br /><br />To start, it has to be clearly stated that there is no real 'bolognaise' perfect dish - it always has and always will be open to interpretation.
<br /><br />To all intents and purposes, the bolognaise is nothing more than a stew with some meat in it - a treat for the poor of Italy some centuries past and for many years, a treat for much of the rest of the western world. Explaining that bolognaise is indeed a paupers dish is a bit like managing to miss the whoopee cushion and landing a very tasty pie in the face.
<br /><br />If you can figure that one out, your doing better than I am.
<br /><br />But it's what you do with it that gets the taste buds going - not the pie or cushion - the dish itself is a marvel !
<br /><br />There's something very special about the bolognaise - the vegetables and herbs are so critical to the success that one often forgets the meat, which is indeed, probably a good thing !
<br /><br />So long as you've got some fleshy meat of any kind, you can make bolognaise.
<br /><br />The meat, while intrinsically important, is nothing more that the carrier of the flavour - the sauce !
<br /><br />The most important thing that bolognaise has is contained in the concept of that sauce.
<br /><br />So, to make a good bolognaise we need moisture, and the best moisture for cooking is wine !
<br /><br />The Basic Ragu - serves two
<br />===========================
<br /><br />1 large sprig rosemary - about a tablespoon when chopped loosley
<br />2 tin of tomatoes or 3 fresh tomatoes chopped
<br />3 1/2 an onion finely chopped
<br />4 1/2 teaspoon fresh chopped garlic
<br />5 salt and pepper to taste
<br />6 some meat - if your hungry, about 600g for two, otherwise 500 to 300g depending on your diet.
<br />7 Olive oil - if you like cooking, you must have and need olive oil in the house - use it at will !
<br />8 Oreganum
<br />9 half a big glass of red wine (190ml)
<br />10 pinch of sugar per person eating.
<br />11 fresh basil and thyme for decoration and added flavour.
<br /><br />Method
<br /><br />Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in pan.
<br />Add rosemary and fry for a few seconds.
<br />Add garlic and fry for a few seconds. (note, you can add this after the onions too if you want for a more garlically flavour)
<br />Add onion and fry for two minutes
<br />Add meat - at this point, you have to almost stir-fry the meat, trying to get it all cooked evenly  - maybe 5 to 8 minutes
<br />When 90% of the meat is lightly browned, add the red wine and cook till the wine fumes evapourate
<br />add in your Oreganum, tomatoes and mushrooms
<br />add salt and pepper to taste
<br />Add the pinches of sugar - a pinch is like 1/5 of a teaspoon.
<br />cover and simmer for 30 minutes.
<br />During simmering, add more wine if bolognaise is dry.
<br />Before serving add extra herbs like fresh basil or thyme if you want.
<br /><br />What you do after that is up to you - a nice salad and glass of dry white or red wine with some garlic bread is highly reccomended.
<br /><br />The quest for the perfect bolognaise, or should we say Ragu, continues !</div>]]></body></post><post id="p14074" date="Posted: Fri Oct 10, 2003 8:21 pm "><author>krankymonkee</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Very nice, I am hungry just reading, will have to try your steps sometime.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p14081" date="Posted: Fri Oct 10, 2003 10:05 pm "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Try to add the garlic last instead of first.

<br />really, a good fish or steak is an art.
<br />but i think i'll give one of these recipies a try.
<br />for meat, what do you think, ground beef, or pork?
<br /><br />bb: 1 tin doesnt help, ounces would. and do we want peeled? sliced? chopped?
<br />oreganum=oregano?
<br />and for sugar, if this is like a spaghatti sauce, i find that honey is the best sweetener.
<br />and olive oil: you like vergin, extra vergin, or light?
<br />and i dont have red wine, anything i could use to substitute?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p14118" date="Posted: Sat Oct 11, 2003 9:16 am "><author>bb_matt</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">It's pretty much open to interpretation how you prepare it.
<br /><br />For two people, I'd say 3 small italian tomatoes are good.
<br /><br />Olive oil - extra virgin is always best, but it's also damn expensive.
<br /><br />If you don't have red wine, you can add half a teaspoon of balsamic vinegar (be carefuly how much you add)
<br /><br />Thanks for the tip about the garlic BNA - and a bit of a history lesson !
<br /><br />Another cool addition is chopped bacon, which you can fry with rosemary before adding the onions.
<br /><br />The best meat is beef - ground beef is called mince in the UK, south africa, australia and new zealand.
<br /><br />Some people advocate getting a really cheap cut of meat of the bone and getting your butcher to grind that - cheap meat of the bone has the best flavour, but it's also the toughest, when it's ground you won't notice it.
<br /><br />There's a million ways to make a Ragu - this is just one of them and it's really tasty - it's hard to go wrong.
<br /><br />Sometimes it's great when it's got tons of tomatoes - that's more of a spagettit sauce.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p14119" date="Posted: Sat Oct 11, 2003 9:25 am "><author>Qwertys</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">so i guess you eat it with garlic bread, french bread, or sourdough bread?

<br /><br />Get yourself some good parmesan cheese (which I refer to as smelly-sock-cheese)
<br /><br />I'll have to introduce everyone to another great recipie that I've perfected - a chicken tagine - but it's really complicated and uses like 25 different ingredients, one of which is preserved lemons ! - it's pretty exotic and is a moroccan dish, but it's damn tasty. At least 30 minutes preparation time tho. The name is a bit misleading as a Tagine is a special pottery caserol dish - it's got a conical lid.
<br /><br />And then there's the curry I've finally got down perfect, with the help of Magic Masala, Garam masala and freshly chopped coriander leaves - tastes totally authentic. It's taken me 10 years to get to the point of making a curry worthy of an indian restaurant !</div>]]></body></post><post id="p14140" date="Posted: Sat Oct 11, 2003 4:53 pm "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Soon enough I'll conquer the world with my overy simple yet perfect tasting Risotto!

This is my first post here and I'm italian, so maybe I can help a bit (-:
<br />I don't eat ragu' 'cause I'm vegetarian, but I've eated it so much in past, and my grandmother's continuing to do it.
<br />I've not personally ever cooked ragu' on my own, but I'm pretty sure that the garlic is not present at all.
<br />Secondly, the *real* ragu' does not cook for only 30 minutes, but for 3-4 hours at least.
<br /><br />Ragu' is not a spaghetti sauce. Here in italy we're not use it on spaghetti, but on other type of pasta that sets off his taste, like lasagne or tortelloni.
<br />Tortelloni is a real simple recipe to do, it's a pasta full of 'ricotta' cheese and spinach. If you want to hear more just tell me (-:

<br /><br />I've variated my original bolognaise recipie somewhat since this original post.
<br />I use a bit more rosemary, and a few pinches of treacle sugar (that dark sticky sugar) - I'm also putting in more olive oil and cutting the onions up incredibly fine.
<br /><br />Interesting about the ragu there Pinhead - I want to try make a veg one that I'll cook for some hours.
<br /><br />I'm also cooking lasagne, but that takes a bit longer - my cheese sauce is totally decadant too, I use full cream, cheddar and parmesan and don't bother with any kinda flour in it  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224170625im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /><br /><br />BTW, edited my original recipie - forgot to mention I usually put the rosemary in at the very beggining.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p50716" date="Posted: Thu Sep 16, 2004 1:11 pm "><author>Pinhead from Outer Space</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Ok, I asked to my grandmother and she said that you can use grinded beef or pork either. Maybe there are two different school of thought here.
<br />She said also that there's no sugar nor treacle (or anyway she don't use it).
<br />For a vegetarian-like ragu' I use some vegetables (carrots, onions, etc...), some spices, and a soya-based compound that I buy at my vegetarian shop of choice.
<br /><br />Yeah, lasagne is a long and not so easy to do stuff. I suggest you to buy the preparation in a shop for the pasta, and then using ragu', bechamel and parmesan as seasoning before cooking it in you oven.
<br /><br />Ok, and now Tortelloni with ragu':
<br />take the flour, set it on your table of work and make a hole in the centre, so it's look like a volcano. Put one eggs (per 100gr of flour) in the hole and a bit of salt and start mixing with a fork at the beginning and with your hands after a while. Continue to work the kneading until it will be smooth and compact (if you need, you can strew you table of work with flour to avoid the mixing to stick on the table). Now just leave it under a cloth for a while.
<br />Well, congratulations, you've done your first egg-based pasta (-:
<br />Prepare the filling: grind some parmesan and put it with come ricotta cheese, salt and spinach (the spinach must be cooked and grinded of course) and mix them.
<br />Now you've to stretch tha pasta and cut it in squares. Put a nut of filling in the middle of the squre and close it on itself. Now you've a triangle. Close every side of the triangle and then join the vertex of the base turning them around your index. It's more difficult saying than doing it.
<br />Ok, now you've got your pasta, cook it and season it with your home-made ragu' (-:
<br />Good appetite!

<br /><br />Serving 4 people, or a hungry gamer for 2 nights
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What you need</span>
<br /><br />1 tablespoon oil, take your pick, verign, veg, etc
<br />1 med onion, sliced
<br />1 clove garlic - FRESH
<br />3 rashers rinless bacon, sliced into chuncks
<br />1 1/2 cups of button muchsrooms - sliced. You can use the big ones, but buttons have more flavor for this
<br />1 x 410 Gram can of cream of chicken, or cream of chicken and mushroom soup. I like to use Campbells, but not every one can get this brand, so use a quilty soup
<br />1/2 cup of watter
<br />350 Grams of Fettuccine, cooked and drained - I like to use Barilla, or Zafarelli, but use what you like, even fresh pasta, as above
<br />Parmesan Chesse for that extra zing
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">How to make it</span>
<br /><br />1. Heat oil in a medium sauce pan, and cook onion, garlic, bacon, and mushroom, untill tender.
<br /><br />2. Add soup and watter, then simmer for 5 mins
<br /><br />3. Pour soup mixture over hot Fettuccine, then add your chesse
<br /><br />Enjoy!
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">NOTES</span>
<br /><br />Though this is for Fettuccine, you can use a scoop pasta, such as elbos, as well, though this is not for a Spegetiy pasta
<br /><br />When we cook this, we normaly put 1/4 cup of mixed veg on the plate as well, becuase the meal has no vitavams, other then the shrooms

<br />Eheheh, you've to leave the pasta drying after you've filled it. And then cook it as any other pasta that you buy in the shop. But this home-made one is quicker to cook. Just put it in boiling water with an handful of salt, and when the pasta come on the surface, leave it another 1/2 minutes and then strain it. Happy cooking! (-:

<br />I don't know if you're referring to italian pasta dishes, but here we almost never use oil, onions and garlic in combo. The most famous receipt that use garlic and oil maybe is Spaghetti with garlic, oil and chilli. Just take an handful of spaghetti, cook it as usual, strain it and then season it with olive oil, garlic's fresh pieces and istantly-grinded chilli as you want. (-:

<br /><br />Aye, what pinead said. The "authentic" recipe I have (not the one I have used, I might add) starts cooking the day before, with slow reduction/disolution of the meat joint into a baking tin shallow with with water. The remainder of the meat is served with veggies, and the sauce presented as a starter with the pasta.

I don't eat ragu' 'cause I'm vegetarian, but I've eated it so much in past, and my grandmother's continuing to do it.&#13;
<br/>
I've not personally ever cooked ragu' on my own, but I'm pretty sure that the garlic is not present at all.&#13;
<br/>
Secondly, the *real* ragu' does not cook for only 30 minutes, but for 3-4 hours at least.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Ragu' is not a spaghetti sauce. Here in italy we're not use it on spaghetti, but on other type of pasta that sets off his taste, like lasagne or tortelloni.&#13;
<br/>
Tortelloni is a real simple recipe to do, it's a pasta full of 'ricotta' cheese and spinach. If you want to hear more just tell me (-:&#13;

I've variated my original bolognaise recipie somewhat since this original post.&#13;

I use a bit more rosemary, and a few pinches of treacle sugar (that dark sticky sugar) - I'm also putting in more olive oil and cutting the onions up incredibly fine.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Interesting about the ragu there Pinhead - I want to try make a veg one that I'll cook for some hours.&#13;
<br/><br/>
I'm also cooking lasagne, but that takes a bit longer - my cheese sauce is totally decadant too, I use full cream, cheddar and parmesan and don't bother with any kinda flour in it  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0"/><br/><br/>

Maybe there are two different school of thought here.&#13;
<br/>
She said also that there's no sugar nor treacle (or anyway she don't use it).&#13;
<br/>
For a vegetarian-like ragu' I use some vegetables (carrots, onions, etc...), some spices, and a soya-based compound that I buy at my vegetarian shop of choice.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Yeah, lasagne is a long and not so easy to do stuff. I suggest you to buy the preparation in a shop for the pasta, and then using ragu', bechamel and parmesan as seasoning before cooking it in you oven.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Ok, and now Tortelloni with ragu':&#13;
<br/>
take the flour, set it on your table of work and make a hole in the centre, so it's look like a volcano. Put one eggs (per 100gr of flour) in the hole and a bit of salt and start mixing with a fork at the beginning and with your hands after a while. Continue to work the kneading until it will be smooth and compact (if you need, you can strew you table of work with flour to avoid the mixing to stick on the table). Now just leave it under a cloth for a while.&#13;
<br/>
Well, congratulations, you've done your first egg-based pasta (-:&#13;
<br/>
Prepare the filling: grind some parmesan and put it with come ricotta cheese, salt and spinach (the spinach must be cooked and grinded of course) and mix them.&#13;
<br/>
Now you've to stretch tha pasta and cut it in squares. Put a nut of filling in the middle of the squre and close it on itself. Now you've a triangle. Close every side of the triangle and then join the vertex of the base turning them around your index. It's more difficult saying than doing it.&#13;
<br/>
Ok, now you've got your pasta, cook it and season it with your home-made ragu' (-:&#13;
<br/>
Good appetite!&#13;

<br/><br/>
I've variated my original bolognaise recipie somewhat since this original post.&#13;
<br/>
I use a bit more rosemary, and a few pinches of treacle sugar (that dark sticky sugar) - I'm also putting in more olive oil and cutting the onions up incredibly fine.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Interesting about the ragu there Pinhead - I want to try make a veg one that I'll cook for some hours.&#13;
<br/><br/>
I'm also cooking lasagne, but that takes a bit longer - my cheese sauce is totally decadant too, I use full cream, cheddar and parmesan and don't bother with any kinda flour in it  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0"/><br/><br/>
BTW, edited my original recipie - forgot to mention I usually put the rosemary in at the very beggining.</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

Maybe there are two different school of thought here.&#13;
<br/>
She said also that there's no sugar nor treacle (or anyway she don't use it).&#13;
<br/>
For a vegetarian-like ragu' I use some vegetables (carrots, onions, etc...), some spices, and a soya-based compound that I buy at my vegetarian shop of choice.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Yeah, lasagne is a long and not so easy to do stuff. I suggest you to buy the preparation in a shop for the pasta, and then using ragu', bechamel and parmesan as seasoning before cooking it in you oven.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Ok, and now Tortelloni with ragu':&#13;
<br/>
take the flour, set it on your table of work and make a hole in the centre, so it's look like a volcano. Put one eggs (per 100gr of flour) in the hole and a bit of salt and start mixing with a fork at the beginning and with your hands after a while. Continue to work the kneading until it will be smooth and compact (if you need, you can strew you table of work with flour to avoid the mixing to stick on the table). Now just leave it under a cloth for a while.&#13;
<br/>
Well, congratulations, you've done your first egg-based pasta (-:&#13;
<br/>
Prepare the filling: grind some parmesan and put it with come ricotta cheese, salt and spinach (the spinach must be cooked and grinded of course) and mix them.&#13;
<br/>
Now you've to stretch tha pasta and cut it in squares. Put a nut of filling in the middle of the squre and close it on itself. Now you've a triangle. Close every side of the triangle and then join the vertex of the base turning them around your index. It's more difficult saying than doing it.&#13;
<br/>
Ok, now you've got your pasta, cook it and season it with your home-made ragu' (-:&#13;
<br/>
Good appetite!&#13;

So, you just boil the pasta as you would with stuff bought in the shop ?&#13;

Hmm, I'll try it, but I'll bet I'll stuff it up somewhere along the line - I can imagine a soggy pile of goo in the pot when I try to boil my pasta <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0"/><br/><br/>
I'm currently cooking for my late lunch tray baked lamb chops with roast potatoes/sweet potatoes and baking some tomatoes with fresh basil/garlic/bayleaves baby leaks, sprinkled with balsamic vinegar and olive oil, I've also knocked together some home made mint sauce - hmmmm, tasty !&#13;
<br/><br/>
I'll post a recipie for that some day, but it's pretty easy. Man, I love cooking, simply because I like eating tasty food ! &#13;

Amen to tossing in red wine... in my mind, that's what seperates the good sauces from the mediocre.  &#13;
<br/><br/>
And yup, the holy trinity--olive oil, onions, garlic--always have their place in just about every pasta dish I've ever made.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Also, I agree with both BNA and matt about the garlic... that is, I usually sautee some with onions and olive oil... and then add a bit more when the whole thing is done, simmering, and mixing flavors.&#13;

What can I say... I'm a garlicoholic and proud of it.&#13;

<br/><br/>
Serving 4 people, or a hungry gamer for 2 nights&#13;
<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">What you need</span>&#13;
<br/><br/>
1 tablespoon oil, take your pick, verign, veg, etc&#13;
<br/>
1 med onion, sliced&#13;
<br/>
1 clove garlic - FRESH&#13;
<br/>
3 rashers rinless bacon, sliced into chuncks&#13;
<br/>
1 1/2 cups of button muchsrooms - sliced. You can use the big ones, but buttons have more flavor for this&#13;
<br/>
1 x 410 Gram can of cream of chicken, or cream of chicken and mushroom soup. I like to use Campbells, but not every one can get this brand, so use a quilty soup&#13;
<br/>
1/2 cup of watter&#13;
<br/>
350 Grams of Fettuccine, cooked and drained - I like to use Barilla, or Zafarelli, but use what you like, even fresh pasta, as above&#13;
<br/>
Parmesan Chesse for that extra zing&#13;
<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">How to make it</span>&#13;
<br/><br/>
1. Heat oil in a medium sauce pan, and cook onion, garlic, bacon, and mushroom, untill tender.&#13;
<br/><br/>
2. Add soup and watter, then simmer for 5 mins&#13;
<br/><br/>
3. Pour soup mixture over hot Fettuccine, then add your chesse&#13;
<br/><br/>
Enjoy!&#13;
<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">NOTES</span>&#13;
<br/><br/>
Though this is for Fettuccine, you can use a scoop pasta, such as elbos, as well, though this is not for a Spegetiy pasta&#13;
<br/><br/>
When we cook this, we normaly put 1/4 cup of mixed veg on the plate as well, becuase the meal has no vitavams, other then the shrooms&#13;

Eheheh, you've to leave the pasta drying after you've filled it. And then cook it as any other pasta that you buy in the shop. But this home-made one is quicker to cook. Just put it in boiling water with an handful of salt, and when the pasta come on the surface, leave it another 1/2 minutes and then strain it. Happy cooking! (-:&#13;

<br/>
I don't know if you're referring to italian pasta dishes, but here we almost never use oil, onions and garlic in combo. The most famous receipt that use garlic and oil maybe is Spaghetti with garlic, oil and chilli. Just take an handful of spaghetti, cook it as usual, strain it and then season it with olive oil, garlic's fresh pieces and istantly-grinded chilli as you want. (-:&#13;
<br/>
It's a great easy-making combo! (-:<br/>_________________<br/>"We must find out what words are and how they function. They become images when written down, but images of words repeated in the mind and not of the image of the thing itself." W.S. Burroughs</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

<br /><br />The road to the perfecto bolognaise !
<br /><br />This is a tough road I'm embarking on - one frought with legend, heresay and solid evidence.
<br />But I need to travel that road of the cooking mind in my quest for "the perfect bolognaise", or, as it is traditionally known, <span style="font-weight: bold">ragu</span> !
<br /><br />To start, it has to be clearly stated that there is no real 'bolognaise' perfect dish - it always has and always will be open to interpretation.
<br /><br />To all intents and purposes, the bolognaise is nothing more than a stew with some meat in it - a treat for the poor of Italy some centuries past and for many years, a treat for much of the rest of the western world. Explaining that bolognaise is indeed a paupers dish is a bit like managing to miss the whoopee cushion and landing a very tasty pie in the face.
<br /><br />If you can figure that one out, your doing better than I am.
<br /><br />But it's what you do with it that gets the taste buds going - not the pie or cushion - the dish itself is a marvel !
<br /><br />There's something very special about the bolognaise - the vegetables and herbs are so critical to the success that one often forgets the meat, which is indeed, probably a good thing !
<br /><br />So long as you've got some fleshy meat of any kind, you can make bolognaise.
<br /><br />The meat, while intrinsically important, is nothing more that the carrier of the flavour - the sauce !
<br /><br />The most important thing that bolognaise has is contained in the concept of that sauce.
<br /><br />So, to make a good bolognaise we need moisture, and the best moisture for cooking is wine !
<br /><br />The Basic Ragu - serves two
<br />===========================
<br /><br />1 large sprig rosemary - about a tablespoon when chopped loosley
<br />2 tin of tomatoes or 3 fresh tomatoes chopped
<br />3 1/2 an onion finely chopped
<br />4 1/2 teaspoon fresh chopped garlic
<br />5 salt and pepper to taste
<br />6 some meat - if your hungry, about 600g for two, otherwise 500 to 300g depending on your diet.
<br />7 Olive oil - if you like cooking, you must have and need olive oil in the house - use it at will !
<br />8 Oreganum
<br />9 half a big glass of red wine (190ml)
<br />10 pinch of sugar per person eating.
<br />11 fresh basil and thyme for decoration and added flavour.
<br /><br />Method
<br /><br />Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in pan.
<br />Add rosemary and fry for a few seconds.
<br />Add garlic and fry for a few seconds. (note, you can add this after the onions too if you want for a more garlically flavour)
<br />Add onion and fry for two minutes
<br />Add meat - at this point, you have to almost stir-fry the meat, trying to get it all cooked evenly  - maybe 5 to 8 minutes
<br />When 90% of the meat is lightly browned, add the red wine and cook till the wine fumes evapourate
<br />add in your Oreganum, tomatoes and mushrooms
<br />add salt and pepper to taste
<br />Add the pinches of sugar - a pinch is like 1/5 of a teaspoon.
<br />cover and simmer for 30 minutes.
<br />During simmering, add more wine if bolognaise is dry.
<br />Before serving add extra herbs like fresh basil or thyme if you want.
<br /><br />What you do after that is up to you - a nice salad and glass of dry white or red wine with some garlic bread is highly reccomended.
<br /><br />The quest for the perfect bolognaise, or should we say Ragu, continues !</div>]]></body></post><post id="p14074" date="Posted: Fri Oct 10, 2003 7:21 pm "><author>krankymonkee</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Very nice, I am hungry just reading, will have to try your steps sometime.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p14081" date="Posted: Fri Oct 10, 2003 9:05 pm "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Try to add the garlic last instead of first.

<br />really, a good fish or steak is an art.
<br />but i think i'll give one of these recipies a try.
<br />for meat, what do you think, ground beef, or pork?
<br /><br />bb: 1 tin doesnt help, ounces would. and do we want peeled? sliced? chopped?
<br />oreganum=oregano?
<br />and for sugar, if this is like a spaghatti sauce, i find that honey is the best sweetener.
<br />and olive oil: you like vergin, extra vergin, or light?
<br />and i dont have red wine, anything i could use to substitute?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p14118" date="Posted: Sat Oct 11, 2003 8:16 am "><author>bb_matt</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">It's pretty much open to interpretation how you prepare it.
<br /><br />For two people, I'd say 3 small italian tomatoes are good.
<br /><br />Olive oil - extra virgin is always best, but it's also damn expensive.
<br /><br />If you don't have red wine, you can add half a teaspoon of balsamic vinegar (be carefuly how much you add)
<br /><br />Thanks for the tip about the garlic BNA - and a bit of a history lesson !
<br /><br />Another cool addition is chopped bacon, which you can fry with rosemary before adding the onions.
<br /><br />The best meat is beef - ground beef is called mince in the UK, south africa, australia and new zealand.
<br /><br />Some people advocate getting a really cheap cut of meat of the bone and getting your butcher to grind that - cheap meat of the bone has the best flavour, but it's also the toughest, when it's ground you won't notice it.
<br /><br />There's a million ways to make a Ragu - this is just one of them and it's really tasty - it's hard to go wrong.
<br /><br />Sometimes it's great when it's got tons of tomatoes - that's more of a spagettit sauce.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p14119" date="Posted: Sat Oct 11, 2003 8:25 am "><author>Qwertys</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">so i guess you eat it with garlic bread, french bread, or sourdough bread?

<br /><br />Get yourself some good parmesan cheese (which I refer to as smelly-sock-cheese)
<br /><br />I'll have to introduce everyone to another great recipie that I've perfected - a chicken tagine - but it's really complicated and uses like 25 different ingredients, one of which is preserved lemons ! - it's pretty exotic and is a moroccan dish, but it's damn tasty. At least 30 minutes preparation time tho. The name is a bit misleading as a Tagine is a special pottery caserol dish - it's got a conical lid.
<br /><br />And then there's the curry I've finally got down perfect, with the help of Magic Masala, Garam masala and freshly chopped coriander leaves - tastes totally authentic.

<br /><br />is a must as is the wine, raises glass.
<br />freash chilli's are also needed, if you get an extreamly strong one it's possible to get the flavour just by slitting the chilli and removing it from the sauce once it's got it's required head, remember chilli does get hotter the more you cook it.
<br /><br />It's also a good point to know that the quality of the mince does make a big difference I always try to go for the steak mince although my girlfriend will tell you different. A bad workman always blames his tools, bah, that phrase is nonsence steak v crappy fatty meat that leaves horrid orange oil on the top of your bol is not what's needed here. for the perfect Bol I would recommend the finest steakmice from a decent local butchers.

<br /><br />mmm, on the topic of roasted veg, parsnip also is good roasted, shallots, tomatos (good for getting rid of free radicals). 
<br /><br />Happy cooking Matt.
<br /><br />lol, just seen my steakmice typo in the previous post, it sounds horrid, was supposed to be mince.

Explaining that bolognaise is indeed a paupers dish is a bit like managing to miss the whoopee cushion and landing a very tasty pie in the face.&#13;<br /><br />If you can figure that one out, your doing better than I am.&#13;<br /><br />But it's what you do with it that gets the taste buds going - not the pie or cushion - the dish itself is a marvel !&#13;<br /><br />There's something very special about the bolognaise - the vegetables and herbs are so critical to the success that one often forgets the meat, which is indeed, probably a good thing !&#13;<br /><br />So long as you've got some fleshy meat of any kind, you can make bolognaise.&#13;<br /><br />The meat, while intrinsically important, is nothing more that the carrier of the flavour - the sauce !&#13;<br /><br />The most important thing that bolognaise has is contained in the concept of that sauce.&#13;<br /><br />So, to make a good bolognaise we need moisture, and the best moisture for cooking is wine !&#13;<br /><br />The Basic Ragu - serves two&#13;<br />===========================&#13;<br /><br />1 large sprig rosemary - about a tablespoon when chopped loosley&#13;<br />2 tin of tomatoes or 3 fresh tomatoes chopped&#13;<br />3 1/2 an onion finely chopped&#13;<br />4 1/2 teaspoon fresh chopped garlic&#13;<br />5 salt and pepper to taste&#13;<br />6 some meat - if your hungry, about 600g for two, otherwise 500 to 300g depending on your diet.&#13;<br />7 Olive oil - if you like cooking, you must have and need olive oil in the house - use it at will !&#13;<br />8 Oreganum&#13;<br />9 half a big glass of red wine (190ml)&#13;<br />10 pinch of sugar per person eating.&#13;<br />11 fresh basil and thyme for decoration and added flavour.&#13;<br /><br />Method&#13;<br /><br />Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in pan.&#13;<br />Add rosemary and fry for a few seconds.&#13;<br />Add garlic and fry for a few seconds. (note, you can add this after the onions too if you want for a more garlically flavour)&#13;<br />Add onion and fry for two minutes&#13;<br />Add meat - at this point, you have to almost stir-fry the meat, trying to get it all cooked evenly  - maybe 5 to 8 minutes&#13;<br />When 90% of the meat is lightly browned, add the red wine and cook till the wine fumes evapourate&#13;<br />add in your Oreganum, tomatoes and mushrooms&#13;<br />add salt and pepper to taste&#13;<br />Add the pinches of sugar - a pinch is like 1/5 of a teaspoon.&#13;<br />cover and simmer for 30 minutes.&#13;<br />During simmering, add more wine if bolognaise is dry.&#13;<br />Before serving add extra herbs like fresh basil or thyme if you want.&#13;<br /><br />What you do after that is up to you - a nice salad and glass of dry white or red wine with some garlic bread is highly reccomended.&#13;<br /><br />The quest for the perfect bolognaise, or should we say Ragu, continues !</div>]]></body></post><post id="p14074" date="Posted: Fri Oct 10, 2003 7:21 pm "><author>krankymonkee</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Very nice, I am hungry just reading, will have to try your steps sometime.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p14081" date="Posted: Fri Oct 10, 2003 9:05 pm "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Try to add the garlic last instead of first.&#13;<br /><br />Garlic is very sensible to heat, so it'll taste better when you put it in during the stage where the bolognaise is just cooking idle.&#13;<br /><br />I don't have my dictionary here right now - so I'll post my variant later <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p14087" date="Posted: Fri Oct 10, 2003 9:55 pm "><author>Qwertys</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">i'm sorry, what is bolognaise?&#13;<br />looks like a spaghetti sauce to me.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p14089" date="Posted: Fri Oct 10, 2003 10:17 pm "><author>Doc</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I don't know what bolognaise is either...&#13;<br /><br />but I want some <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p14091" date="Posted: Fri Oct 10, 2003 10:44 pm "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Actually it's called "Ragù alla bolognese" and the people in Bologna call it simply Ragù.&#13;<br /><br />If you like it's simply spaghetty souce, but in reality it's an art.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p14115" date="Posted: Sat Oct 11, 2003 7:38 am "><author>Qwertys</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">an art?&#13;<br />so, you dont eat it with spaghetty?&#13;<br />really, a good fish or steak is an art.&#13;<br />but i think i'll give one of these recipies a try.&#13;<br />for meat, what do you think, ground beef, or pork?&#13;<br /><br />bb: 1 tin doesnt help, ounces would. and do we want peeled?

						<div class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold">Small webmaster edit: This is our official "perfect recipe" thread - please contribute!</span>&#13;<br /><br />The road to the perfecto bolognaise !&#13;<br /><br />This is a tough road I'm embarking on - one frought with legend, heresay and solid evidence.&#13;<br />But I need to travel that road of the cooking mind in my quest for "the perfect bolognaise", or, as it is traditionally known, <span style="font-weight: bold">ragu</span> !&#13;<br /><br />To start, it has to be clearly stated that there is no real 'bolognaise' perfect dish - it always has and always will be open to interpretation.&#13;<br /><br />To all intents and purposes, the bolognaise is nothing more than a stew with some meat in it - a treat for the poor of Italy some centuries past and for many years, a treat for much of the rest of the western world. Explaining that bolognaise is indeed a paupers dish is a bit like managing to miss the whoopee cushion and landing a very tasty pie in the face.&#13;<br /><br />If you can figure that one out, your doing better than I am.&#13;<br /><br />But it's what you do with it that gets the taste buds going - not the pie or cushion - the dish itself is a marvel !&#13;<br /><br />There's something very special about the bolognaise - the vegetables and herbs are so critical to the success that one often forgets the meat, which is indeed, probably a good thing !&#13;<br /><br />So long as you've got some fleshy meat of any kind, you can make bolognaise.&#13;<br /><br />The meat, while intrinsically important, is nothing more that the carrier of the flavour - the sauce !&#13;<br /><br />The most important thing that bolognaise has is contained in the concept of that sauce.&#13;<br /><br />So, to make a good bolognaise we need moisture, and the best moisture for cooking is wine !&#13;<br /><br />The Basic Ragu - serves two&#13;<br />===========================&#13;<br /><br />1 large sprig rosemary - about a tablespoon when chopped loosley&#13;<br />2 tin of tomatoes or 3 fresh tomatoes chopped&#13;<br />3 1/2 an onion finely chopped&#13;<br />4 1/2 teaspoon fresh chopped garlic&#13;<br />5 salt and pepper to taste&#13;<br />6 some meat - if your hungry, about 600g for two, otherwise 500 to 300g depending on your diet.&#13;<br />7 Olive oil - if you like cooking, you must have and need olive oil in the house - use it at will !&#13;<br />8 Oreganum&#13;<br />9 half a big glass of red wine (190ml)&#13;<br />10 pinch of sugar per person eating.&#13;<br />11 fresh basil and thyme for decoration and added flavour.&#13;<br /><br />Method&#13;<br /><br />Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in pan.&#13;<br />Add rosemary and fry for a few seconds.&#13;<br />Add garlic and fry for a few seconds. (note, you can add this after the onions too if you want for a more garlically flavour)&#13;<br />Add onion and fry for two minutes&#13;<br />Add meat - at this point, you have to almost stir-fry the meat, trying to get it all cooked evenly  - maybe 5 to 8 minutes&#13;<br />When 90% of the meat is lightly browned, add the red wine and cook till the wine fumes evapourate&#13;<br />add in your Oreganum, tomatoes and mushrooms&#13;<br />add salt and pepper to taste&#13;<br />Add the pinches of sugar - a pinch is like 1/5 of a teaspoon.&#13;<br />cover and simmer for 30 minutes.&#13;<br />During simmering, add more wine if bolognaise is dry.&#13;<br />Before serving add extra herbs like fresh basil or thyme if you want.&#13;<br /><br />What you do after that is up to you - a nice salad and glass of dry white or red wine with some garlic bread is highly reccomended.&#13;<br /><br />The quest for the perfect bolognaise, or should we say Ragu, continues !</div>

						<div class="postbody">It's pretty much open to interpretation how you prepare it.&#13;<br /><br />For two people, I'd say 3 small italian tomatoes are good.&#13;<br /><br />Olive oil - extra virgin is always best, but it's also damn expensive.&#13;<br /><br />If you don't have red wine, you can add half a teaspoon of balsamic vinegar (be carefuly how much you add)&#13;<br /><br />Thanks for the tip about the garlic BNA - and a bit of a history lesson !&#13;<br /><br />Another cool addition is chopped bacon, which you can fry with rosemary before adding the onions.&#13;<br /><br />The best meat is beef - ground beef is called mince in the UK, south africa, australia and new zealand.&#13;<br /><br />Some people advocate getting a really cheap cut of meat of the bone and getting your butcher to grind that - cheap meat of the bone has the best flavour, but it's also the toughest, when it's ground you won't notice it.&#13;<br /><br />There's a million ways to make a Ragu - this is just one of them and it's really tasty - it's hard to go wrong.&#13;<br /><br />Sometimes it's great when it's got tons of tomatoes - that's more of a spagettit sauce.</div>

At least 30 minutes preparation time tho. The name is a bit misleading as a Tagine is a special pottery caserol dish - it's got a conical lid.&#13;<br /><br />And then there's the curry I've finally got down perfect, with the help of Magic Masala, Garam masala and freshly chopped coriander leaves - tastes totally authentic. It's taken me 10 years to get to the point of making a curry worthy of an indian restaurant !</div>

						<div class="postbody">garlic with the oil to infuse the garic goodness, garlic also changes taste depending upon how you cut ti, the finer the more garlic flavour you get.

A bad workman always blames his tools, bah, that phrase is nonsence steak v crappy fatty meat that leaves horrid orange oil on the top of your bol is not what's needed here. for the perfect Bol I would recommend the finest steakmice from a decent local butchers.&#13;<br /><br />BTW, hows the diet going Matt, hope your fine &amp; well, missed you during the last stage of the texture challenge, I took over the last stage of the challenge so please send me whatever files you want to submit is at all &amp; I'll erm, submit them.

<br /><br />The road to the perfecto bolognaise !
<br /><br />This is a tough road I'm embarking on - one frought with legend, heresay and solid evidence.
<br />But I need to travel that road of the cooking mind in my quest for "the perfect bolognaise", or, as it is traditionally known, <span style="font-weight: bold">ragu</span> !
<br /><br />To start, it has to be clearly stated that there is no real 'bolognaise' perfect dish - it always has and always will be open to interpretation.
<br /><br />To all intents and purposes, the bolognaise is nothing more than a stew with some meat in it - a treat for the poor of Italy some centuries past and for many years, a treat for much of the rest of the western world. Explaining that bolognaise is indeed a paupers dish is a bit like managing to miss the whoopee cushion and landing a very tasty pie in the face.
<br /><br />If you can figure that one out, your doing better than I am.
<br /><br />But it's what you do with it that gets the taste buds going - not the pie or cushion - the dish itself is a marvel !
<br /><br />There's something very special about the bolognaise - the vegetables and herbs are so critical to the success that one often forgets the meat, which is indeed, probably a good thing !
<br /><br />So long as you've got some fleshy meat of any kind, you can make bolognaise.
<br /><br />The meat, while intrinsically important, is nothing more that the carrier of the flavour - the sauce !
<br /><br />The most important thing that bolognaise has is contained in the concept of that sauce.
<br /><br />So, to make a good bolognaise we need moisture, and the best moisture for cooking is wine !
<br /><br />The Basic Ragu - serves two
<br />===========================
<br /><br />1 large sprig rosemary - about a tablespoon when chopped loosley
<br />2 tin of tomatoes or 3 fresh tomatoes chopped
<br />3 1/2 an onion finely chopped
<br />4 1/2 teaspoon fresh chopped garlic
<br />5 salt and pepper to taste
<br />6 some meat - if your hungry, about 600g for two, otherwise 500 to 300g depending on your diet.
<br />7 Olive oil - if you like cooking, you must have and need olive oil in the house - use it at will !
<br />8 Oreganum
<br />9 half a big glass of red wine (190ml)
<br />10 pinch of sugar per person eating.
<br />11 fresh basil and thyme for decoration and added flavour.
<br /><br />Method
<br /><br />Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in pan.
<br />Add rosemary and fry for a few seconds.
<br />Add garlic and fry for a few seconds. (note, you can add this after the onions too if you want for a more garlically flavour)
<br />Add onion and fry for two minutes
<br />Add meat - at this point, you have to almost stir-fry the meat, trying to get it all cooked evenly  - maybe 5 to 8 minutes
<br />When 90% of the meat is lightly browned, add the red wine and cook till the wine fumes evapourate
<br />add in your Oreganum, tomatoes and mushrooms
<br />add salt and pepper to taste
<br />Add the pinches of sugar - a pinch is like 1/5 of a teaspoon.
<br />cover and simmer for 30 minutes.
<br />During simmering, add more wine if bolognaise is dry.
<br />Before serving add extra herbs like fresh basil or thyme if you want.
<br /><br />What you do after that is up to you - a nice salad and glass of dry white or red wine with some garlic bread is highly reccomended.

<br /><br />Another cool addition is chopped bacon, which you can fry with rosemary before adding the onions.

<br /><br />Some people advocate getting a really cheap cut of meat of the bone and getting your butcher to grind that - cheap meat of the bone has the best flavour, but it's also the toughest, when it's ground you won't notice it.
<br /><br />There's a million ways to make a Ragu - this is just one of them and it's really tasty - it's hard to go wrong.

<br /><br />The road to the perfecto bolognaise !
<br /><br />This is a tough road I'm embarking on - one frought with legend, heresay and solid evidence.
<br />But I need to travel that road of the cooking mind in my quest for "the perfect bolognaise", or, as it is traditionally known, <span style="font-weight: bold">ragu</span> !
<br /><br />To start, it has to be clearly stated that there is no real 'bolognaise' perfect dish - it always has and always will be open to interpretation.
<br /><br />To all intents and purposes, the bolognaise is nothing more than a stew with some meat in it - a treat for the poor of Italy some centuries past and for many years, a treat for much of the rest of the western world. Explaining that bolognaise is indeed a paupers dish is a bit like managing to miss the whoopee cushion and landing a very tasty pie in the face.
<br /><br />If you can figure that one out, your doing better than I am.
<br /><br />But it's what you do with it that gets the taste buds going - not the pie or cushion - the dish itself is a marvel !
<br /><br />There's something very special about the bolognaise - the vegetables and herbs are so critical to the success that one often forgets the meat, which is indeed, probably a good thing !
<br /><br />So long as you've got some fleshy meat of any kind, you can make bolognaise.
<br /><br />The meat, while intrinsically important, is nothing more that the carrier of the flavour - the sauce !
<br /><br />The most important thing that bolognaise has is contained in the concept of that sauce.
<br /><br />So, to make a good bolognaise we need moisture, and the best moisture for cooking is wine !
<br /><br />The Basic Ragu - serves two
<br />===========================
<br /><br />1 large sprig rosemary - about a tablespoon when chopped loosley
<br />2 tin of tomatoes or 3 fresh tomatoes chopped
<br />3 1/2 an onion finely chopped
<br />4 1/2 teaspoon fresh chopped garlic
<br />5 salt and pepper to taste
<br />6 some meat - if your hungry, about 600g for two, otherwise 500 to 300g depending on your diet.
<br />7 Olive oil - if you like cooking, you must have and need olive oil in the house - use it at will !
<br />8 Oreganum
<br />9 half a big glass of red wine (190ml)
<br />10 pinch of sugar per person eating.
<br />11 fresh basil and thyme for decoration and added flavour.
<br /><br />Method
<br /><br />Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in pan.
<br />Add rosemary and fry for a few seconds.
<br />Add garlic and fry for a few seconds. (note, you can add this after the onions too if you want for a more garlically flavour)
<br />Add onion and fry for two minutes
<br />Add meat - at this point, you have to almost stir-fry the meat, trying to get it all cooked evenly  - maybe 5 to 8 minutes
<br />When 90% of the meat is lightly browned, add the red wine and cook till the wine fumes evapourate
<br />add in your Oreganum, tomatoes and mushrooms
<br />add salt and pepper to taste
<br />Add the pinches of sugar - a pinch is like 1/5 of a teaspoon.
<br />cover and simmer for 30 minutes.
<br />During simmering, add more wine if bolognaise is dry.
<br />Before serving add extra herbs like fresh basil or thyme if you want.
<br /><br />What you do after that is up to you - a nice salad and glass of dry white or red wine with some garlic bread is highly reccomended.
<br /><br />The quest for the perfect bolognaise, or should we say Ragu, continues !</div>]]></body></post><post id="p14074" date="Posted: Fri Oct 10, 2003 7:21 pm "><author>krankymonkee</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Very nice, I am hungry just reading, will have to try your steps sometime.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p14081" date="Posted: Fri Oct 10, 2003 9:05 pm "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Try to add the garlic last instead of first.

<br /><br />But it's what you do with it that gets the taste buds going - not the pie or cushion - the dish itself is a marvel !
<br /><br />There's something very special about the bolognaise - the vegetables and herbs are so critical to the success that one often forgets the meat, which is indeed, probably a good thing !
<br /><br />So long as you've got some fleshy meat of any kind, you can make bolognaise.
<br /><br />The meat, while intrinsically important, is nothing more that the carrier of the flavour - the sauce !
<br /><br />The most important thing that bolognaise has is contained in the concept of that sauce.
<br /><br />So, to make a good bolognaise we need moisture, and the best moisture for cooking is wine !
<br /><br />The Basic Ragu - serves two
<br />===========================
<br /><br />1 large sprig rosemary - about a tablespoon when chopped loosley
<br />2 tin of tomatoes or 3 fresh tomatoes chopped
<br />3 1/2 an onion finely chopped
<br />4 1/2 teaspoon fresh chopped garlic
<br />5 salt and pepper to taste
<br />6 some meat - if your hungry, about 600g for two, otherwise 500 to 300g depending on your diet.
<br />7 Olive oil - if you like cooking, you must have and need olive oil in the house - use it at will !
<br />8 Oreganum
<br />9 half a big glass of red wine (190ml)
<br />10 pinch of sugar per person eating.
<br />11 fresh basil and thyme for decoration and added flavour.
<br /><br />Method
<br /><br />Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in pan.
<br />Add rosemary and fry for a few seconds.
<br />Add garlic and fry for a few seconds. (note, you can add this after the onions too if you want for a more garlically flavour)
<br />Add onion and fry for two minutes
<br />Add meat - at this point, you have to almost stir-fry the meat, trying to get it all cooked evenly  - maybe 5 to 8 minutes
<br />When 90% of the meat is lightly browned, add the red wine and cook till the wine fumes evapourate
<br />add in your Oreganum, tomatoes and mushrooms
<br />add salt and pepper to taste
<br />Add the pinches of sugar - a pinch is like 1/5 of a teaspoon.
<br />cover and simmer for 30 minutes.
<br />During simmering, add more wine if bolognaise is dry.
<br />Before serving add extra herbs like fresh basil or thyme if you want.
<br /><br />What you do after that is up to you - a nice salad and glass of dry white or red wine with some garlic bread is highly reccomended.
<br /><br />The quest for the perfect bolognaise, or should we say Ragu, continues !</div>]]></body></post><post id="p14074" date="Posted: Fri Oct 10, 2003 7:21 pm "><author>krankymonkee</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Very nice, I am hungry just reading, will have to try your steps sometime.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p14081" date="Posted: Fri Oct 10, 2003 9:05 pm "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Try to add the garlic last instead of first.

<br /><br />For two people, I'd say 3 small italian tomatoes are good.

<br /><br />Another cool addition is chopped bacon, which you can fry with rosemary before adding the onions.
<br /><br />The best meat is beef - ground beef is called mince in the UK, south africa, australia and new zealand.
<br /><br />Some people advocate getting a really cheap cut of meat of the bone and getting your butcher to grind that - cheap meat of the bone has the best flavour, but it's also the toughest, when it's ground you won't notice it.
<br /><br />There's a million ways to make a Ragu - this is just one of them and it's really tasty - it's hard to go wrong.

<br /><br />The road to the perfecto bolognaise !
<br /><br />This is a tough road I'm embarking on - one frought with legend, heresay and solid evidence.
<br />But I need to travel that road of the cooking mind in my quest for "the perfect bolognaise", or, as it is traditionally known, <span style="font-weight: bold">ragu</span> !
<br /><br />To start, it has to be clearly stated that there is no real 'bolognaise' perfect dish - it always has and always will be open to interpretation.
<br /><br />To all intents and purposes, the bolognaise is nothing more than a stew with some meat in it - a treat for the poor of Italy some centuries past and for many years, a treat for much of the rest of the western world. Explaining that bolognaise is indeed a paupers dish is a bit like managing to miss the whoopee cushion and landing a very tasty pie in the face.
<br /><br />If you can figure that one out, your doing better than I am.
<br /><br />But it's what you do with it that gets the taste buds going - not the pie or cushion - the dish itself is a marvel !
<br /><br />There's something very special about the bolognaise - the vegetables and herbs are so critical to the success that one often forgets the meat, which is indeed, probably a good thing !
<br /><br />So long as you've got some fleshy meat of any kind, you can make bolognaise.
<br /><br />The meat, while intrinsically important, is nothing more that the carrier of the flavour - the sauce !
<br /><br />The most important thing that bolognaise has is contained in the concept of that sauce.
<br /><br />So, to make a good bolognaise we need moisture, and the best moisture for cooking is wine !
<br /><br />The Basic Ragu - serves two
<br />===========================
<br /><br />1 large sprig rosemary - about a tablespoon when chopped loosley
<br />2 tin of tomatoes or 3 fresh tomatoes chopped
<br />3 1/2 an onion finely chopped

<br /><br />The road to the perfecto bolognaise !
<br /><br />This is a tough road I'm embarking on - one frought with legend, heresay and solid evidence.
<br />But I need to travel that road of the cooking mind in my quest for "the perfect bolognaise", or, as it is traditionally known, <span style="font-weight: bold">ragu</span> !
<br /><br />To start, it has to be clearly stated that there is no real 'bolognaise' perfect dish - it always has and always will be open to interpretation.
<br /><br />To all intents and purposes, the bolognaise is nothing more than a stew with some meat in it - a treat for the poor of Italy some centuries past and for many years, a treat for much of the rest of the western world. Explaining that bolognaise is indeed a paupers dish is a bit like managing to miss the whoopee cushion and landing a very tasty pie in the face.
<br /><br />If you can figure that one out, your doing better than I am.
<br /><br />But it's what you do with it that gets the taste buds going - not the pie or cushion - the dish itself is a marvel !
<br /><br />There's something very special about the bolognaise - the vegetables and herbs are so critical to the success that one often forgets the meat, which is indeed, probably a good thing !
<br /><br />So long as you've got some fleshy meat of any kind, you can make bolognaise.
<br /><br />The meat, while intrinsically important, is nothing more that the carrier of the flavour - the sauce !
<br /><br />The most important thing that bolognaise has is contained in the concept of that sauce.
<br /><br />So, to make a good bolognaise we need moisture, and the best moisture for cooking is wine !
<br /><br />The Basic Ragu - serves two
<br />===========================
<br /><br />1 large sprig rosemary - about a tablespoon when chopped loosley
<br />2 tin of tomatoes or 3 fresh tomatoes chopped
<br />3 1/2 an onion finely chopped
<br />4 1/2 teaspoon fresh chopped garlic
<br />5 salt and pepper to taste
<br />6 some meat - if your hungry, about 600g for two, otherwise 500 to 300g depending on your diet.
<br />7 Olive oil - if you like cooking, you must have and need olive oil in the house - use it at will !
<br />8 Oreganum
<br />9 half a big glass of red wine (190ml)
<br />10 pinch of sugar per person eating.
<br />11 fresh basil and thyme for decoration and added flavour.
<br /><br />Method
<br /><br />Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in pan.
<br />Add rosemary and fry for a few seconds.
<br />Add garlic and fry for a few seconds. (note, you can add this after the onions too if you want for a more garlically flavour)
<br />Add onion and fry for two minutes
<br />Add meat - at this point, you have to almost stir-fry the meat, trying to get it all cooked evenly  - maybe 5 to 8 minutes
<br />When 90% of the meat is lightly browned, add the red wine and cook till the wine fumes evapourate
<br />add in your Oreganum, tomatoes and mushrooms
<br />add salt and pepper to taste
<br />Add the pinches of sugar - a pinch is like 1/5 of a teaspoon.
<br />cover and simmer for 30 minutes.
<br />During simmering, add more wine if bolognaise is dry.
<br />Before serving add extra herbs like fresh basil or thyme if you want.
<br /><br />What you do after that is up to you - a nice salad and glass of dry white or red wine with some garlic bread is highly reccomended.
<br /><br />The quest for the perfect bolognaise, or should we say Ragu, continues !</div>]]></body></post><post id="p14074" date="Posted: Fri Oct 10, 2003 7:21 pm "><author>krankymonkee</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Very nice, I am hungry just reading, will have to try your steps sometime.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p14081" date="Posted: Fri Oct 10, 2003 9:05 pm "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Try to add the garlic last instead of first.

If you cook a whole clove (always works well roasted then the garlic is v sweet (and v tasty), you get more vampire repelant from crushed garlic in case antone is having problems with the living dead. 
<br /><br />is a must as is the wine, raises glass.
<br />freash chilli's are also needed, if you get an extreamly strong one it's possible to get the flavour just by slitting the chilli and removing it from the sauce once it's got it's required head, remember chilli does get hotter the more you cook it.
<br /><br />It's also a good point to know that the quality of the mince does make a big difference I always try to go for the steak mince although my girlfriend will tell you different. A bad workman always blames his tools, bah, that phrase is nonsence steak v crappy fatty meat that leaves horrid orange oil on the top of your bol is not what's needed here. for the perfect Bol I would recommend the finest steakmice from a decent local butchers.

<br /><br />The road to the perfecto bolognaise !

<br /><br />To start, it has to be clearly stated that there is no real 'bolognaise' perfect dish - it always has and always will be open to interpretation.
<br /><br />To all intents and purposes, the bolognaise is nothing more than a stew with some meat in it - a treat for the poor of Italy some centuries past and for many years, a treat for much of the rest of the western world. Explaining that bolognaise is indeed a paupers dish is a bit like managing to miss the whoopee cushion and landing a very tasty pie in the face.
<br /><br />If you can figure that one out, your doing better than I am.
<br /><br />But it's what you do with it that gets the taste buds going - not the pie or cushion - the dish itself is a marvel !
<br /><br />There's something very special about the bolognaise - the vegetables and herbs are so critical to the success that one often forgets the meat, which is indeed, probably a good thing !
<br /><br />So long as you've got some fleshy meat of any kind, you can make bolognaise.
<br /><br />The meat, while intrinsically important, is nothing more that the carrier of the flavour - the sauce !
<br /><br />The most important thing that bolognaise has is contained in the concept of that sauce.

<br /><br />The road to the perfecto bolognaise !
<br /><br />This is a tough road I'm embarking on - one frought with legend, heresay and solid evidence.
<br />But I need to travel that road of the cooking mind in my quest for "the perfect bolognaise", or, as it is traditionally known, <span style="font-weight: bold">ragu</span> !
<br /><br />To start, it has to be clearly stated that there is no real 'bolognaise' perfect dish - it always has and always will be open to interpretation.
<br /><br />To all intents and purposes, the bolognaise is nothing more than a stew with some meat in it - a treat for the poor of Italy some centuries past and for many years, a treat for much of the rest of the western world. Explaining that bolognaise is indeed a paupers dish is a bit like managing to miss the whoopee cushion and landing a very tasty pie in the face.
<br /><br />If you can figure that one out, your doing better than I am.
<br /><br />But it's what you do with it that gets the taste buds going - not the pie or cushion - the dish itself is a marvel !
<br /><br />There's something very special about the bolognaise - the vegetables and herbs are so critical to the success that one often forgets the meat, which is indeed, probably a good thing !
<br /><br />So long as you've got some fleshy meat of any kind, you can make bolognaise.
<br /><br />The meat, while intrinsically important, is nothing more that the carrier of the flavour - the sauce !
<br /><br />The most important thing that bolognaise has is contained in the concept of that sauce.
<br /><br />So, to make a good bolognaise we need moisture, and the best moisture for cooking is wine !
<br /><br />The Basic Ragu - serves two
<br />===========================
<br /><br />1 large sprig rosemary - about a tablespoon when chopped loosley
<br />2 tin of tomatoes or 3 fresh tomatoes chopped
<br />3 1/2 an onion finely chopped
<br />4 1/2 teaspoon fresh chopped garlic
<br />5 salt and pepper to taste
<br />6 some meat - if your hungry, about 600g for two, otherwise 500 to 300g depending on your diet.
<br />7 Olive oil - if you like cooking, you must have and need olive oil in the house - use it at will !
<br />8 Oreganum
<br />9 half a big glass of red wine (190ml)
<br />10 pinch of sugar per person eating.
<br />11 fresh basil and thyme for decoration and added flavour.
<br /><br />Method
<br /><br />Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in pan.
<br />Add rosemary and fry for a few seconds.
<br />Add garlic and fry for a few seconds. (note, you can add this after the onions too if you want for a more garlically flavour)
<br />Add onion and fry for two minutes
<br />Add meat - at this point, you have to almost stir-fry the meat, trying to get it all cooked evenly  - maybe 5 to 8 minutes
<br />When 90% of the meat is lightly browned, add the red wine and cook till the wine fumes evapourate
<br />add in your Oreganum, tomatoes and mushrooms
<br />add salt and pepper to taste
<br />Add the pinches of sugar - a pinch is like 1/5 of a teaspoon.
<br />cover and simmer for 30 minutes.
<br />During simmering, add more wine if bolognaise is dry.
<br />Before serving add extra herbs like fresh basil or thyme if you want.
<br /><br />What you do after that is up to you - a nice salad and glass of dry white or red wine with some garlic bread is highly reccomended.
<br /><br />The quest for the perfect bolognaise, or should we say Ragu, continues !</div>]]></body></post><post id="p14074" date="Posted: Fri Oct 10, 2003 7:21 pm "><author>krankymonkee</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Very nice, I am hungry just reading, will have to try your steps sometime.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p14081" date="Posted: Fri Oct 10, 2003 9:05 pm "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Try to add the garlic last instead of first.

<br /><br />For two people, I'd say 3 small italian tomatoes are good.

<br /><br />Thanks for the tip about the garlic BNA - and a bit of a history lesson !
<br /><br />Another cool addition is chopped bacon, which you can fry with rosemary before adding the onions.
<br /><br />The best meat is beef - ground beef is called mince in the UK, south africa, australia and new zealand.
<br /><br />Some people advocate getting a really cheap cut of meat of the bone and getting your butcher to grind that - cheap meat of the bone has the best flavour, but it's also the toughest, when it's ground you won't notice it.
<br /><br />There's a million ways to make a Ragu - this is just one of them and it's really tasty - it's hard to go wrong.
<br /><br />Sometimes it's great when it's got tons of tomatoes - that's more of a spagettit sauce.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p14119" date="Posted: Sat Oct 11, 2003 8:25 am "><author>Qwertys</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">so i guess you eat it with garlic bread, french bread, or sourdough bread?

<br /><br />Get yourself some good parmesan cheese (which I refer to as smelly-sock-cheese)
<br /><br />I'll have to introduce everyone to another great recipie that I've perfected - a chicken tagine - but it's really complicated and uses like 25 different ingredients, one of which is preserved lemons ! - it's pretty exotic and is a moroccan dish, but it's damn tasty. At least 30 minutes preparation time tho. The name is a bit misleading as a Tagine is a special pottery caserol dish - it's got a conical lid.
<br /><br />And then there's the curry I've finally got down perfect, with the help of Magic Masala, Garam masala and freshly chopped coriander leaves - tastes totally authentic.

<br /><br />There's a million ways to make a Ragu - this is just one of them and it's really tasty - it's hard to go wrong.
<br /><br />Sometimes it's great when it's got tons of tomatoes - that's more of a spagettit sauce.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p14119" date="Posted: Sat Oct 11, 2003 8:25 am "><author>Qwertys</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">so i guess you eat it with garlic bread, french bread, or sourdough bread?

<br /><br />The road to the perfecto bolognaise !
<br /><br />This is a tough road I'm embarking on - one frought with legend, heresay and solid evidence.
<br />But I need to travel that road of the cooking mind in my quest for "the perfect bolognaise", or, as it is traditionally known, <span style="font-weight: bold">ragu</span> !
<br /><br />To start, it has to be clearly stated that there is no real 'bolognaise' perfect dish - it always has and always will be open to interpretation.
<br /><br />To all intents and purposes, the bolognaise is nothing more than a stew with some meat in it - a treat for the poor of Italy some centuries past and for many years, a treat for much of the rest of the western world. Explaining that bolognaise is indeed a paupers dish is a bit like managing to miss the whoopee cushion and landing a very tasty pie in the face.
<br /><br />If you can figure that one out, your doing better than I am.
<br /><br />But it's what you do with it that gets the taste buds going - not the pie or cushion - the dish itself is a marvel !
<br /><br />There's something very special about the bolognaise - the vegetables and herbs are so critical to the success that one often forgets the meat, which is indeed, probably a good thing !
<br /><br />So long as you've got some fleshy meat of any kind, you can make bolognaise.
<br /><br />The meat, while intrinsically important, is nothing more that the carrier of the flavour - the sauce !
<br /><br />The most important thing that bolognaise has is contained in the concept of that sauce.
<br /><br />So, to make a good bolognaise we need moisture, and the best moisture for cooking is wine !
<br /><br />The Basic Ragu - serves two
<br />===========================
<br /><br />1 large sprig rosemary - about a tablespoon when chopped loosley
<br />2 tin of tomatoes or 3 fresh tomatoes chopped
<br />3 1/2 an onion finely chopped
<br />4 1/2 teaspoon fresh chopped garlic
<br />5 salt and pepper to taste
<br />6 some meat - if your hungry, about 600g for two, otherwise 500 to 300g depending on your diet.
<br />7 Olive oil - if you like cooking, you must have and need olive oil in the house - use it at will !
<br />8 Oreganum
<br />9 half a big glass of red wine (190ml)
<br />10 pinch of sugar per person eating.
<br />11 fresh basil and thyme for decoration and added flavour.
<br /><br />Method
<br /><br />Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in pan.
<br />Add rosemary and fry for a few seconds.
<br />Add garlic and fry for a few seconds. (note, you can add this after the onions too if you want for a more garlically flavour)
<br />Add onion and fry for two minutes
<br />Add meat - at this point, you have to almost stir-fry the meat, trying to get it all cooked evenly  - maybe 5 to 8 minutes
<br />When 90% of the meat is lightly browned, add the red wine and cook till the wine fumes evapourate
<br />add in your Oreganum, tomatoes and mushrooms
<br />add salt and pepper to taste
<br />Add the pinches of sugar - a pinch is like 1/5 of a teaspoon.
<br />cover and simmer for 30 minutes.
<br />During simmering, add more wine if bolognaise is dry.
<br />Before serving add extra herbs like fresh basil or thyme if you want.
<br /><br />What you do after that is up to you - a nice salad and glass of dry white or red wine with some garlic bread is highly reccomended.

<br />so, you dont eat it with spaghetty?
<br />really, a good fish or steak is an art.
<br />but i think i'll give one of these recipies a try.
<br />for meat, what do you think, ground beef, or pork?
<br /><br />bb: 1 tin doesnt help, ounces would. and do we want peeled? sliced? chopped?
<br />oreganum=oregano?
<br />and for sugar, if this is like a spaghatti sauce, i find that honey is the best sweetener.
<br />and olive oil: you like vergin, extra vergin, or light?
<br />and i dont have red wine, anything i could use to substitute?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p14118" date="Posted: Sat Oct 11, 2003 8:16 am "><author>bb_matt</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">It's pretty much open to interpretation how you prepare it.
<br /><br />For two people, I'd say 3 small italian tomatoes are good.
<br /><br />Olive oil - extra virgin is always best, but it's also damn expensive.
<br /><br />If you don't have red wine, you can add half a teaspoon of balsamic vinegar (be carefuly how much you add)
<br /><br />Thanks for the tip about the garlic BNA - and a bit of a history lesson !
<br /><br />Another cool addition is chopped bacon, which you can fry with rosemary before adding the onions.
<br /><br />The best meat is beef - ground beef is called mince in the UK, south africa, australia and new zealand.
<br /><br />Some people advocate getting a really cheap cut of meat of the bone and getting your butcher to grind that - cheap meat of the bone has the best flavour, but it's also the toughest, when it's ground you won't notice it.

<br /><br />For two people, I'd say 3 small italian tomatoes are good.
<br /><br />Olive oil - extra virgin is always best, but it's also damn expensive.
<br /><br />If you don't have red wine, you can add half a teaspoon of balsamic vinegar (be carefuly how much you add)
<br /><br />Thanks for the tip about the garlic BNA - and a bit of a history lesson !
<br /><br />Another cool addition is chopped bacon, which you can fry with rosemary before adding the onions.
<br /><br />The best meat is beef - ground beef is called mince in the UK, south africa, australia and new zealand.
<br /><br />Some people advocate getting a really cheap cut of meat of the bone and getting your butcher to grind that - cheap meat of the bone has the best flavour, but it's also the toughest, when it's ground you won't notice it.
<br /><br />There's a million ways to make a Ragu - this is just one of them and it's really tasty - it's hard to go wrong.
<br /><br />Sometimes it's great when it's got tons of tomatoes - that's more of a spagettit sauce.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p14119" date="Posted: Sat Oct 11, 2003 8:25 am "><author>Qwertys</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">so i guess you eat it with garlic bread, french bread, or sourdough bread?

<br /><br />The road to the perfecto bolognaise !
<br /><br />This is a tough road I'm embarking on - one frought with legend, heresay and solid evidence.
<br />But I need to travel that road of the cooking mind in my quest for "the perfect bolognaise", or, as it is traditionally known, <span style="font-weight: bold">ragu</span> !
<br /><br />To start, it has to be clearly stated that there is no real 'bolognaise' perfect dish - it always has and always will be open to interpretation.
<br /><br />To all intents and purposes, the bolognaise is nothing more than a stew with some meat in it - a treat for the poor of Italy some centuries past and for many years, a treat for much of the rest of the western world. Explaining that bolognaise is indeed a paupers dish is a bit like managing to miss the whoopee cushion and landing a very tasty pie in the face.
<br /><br />If you can figure that one out, your doing better than I am.
<br /><br />But it's what you do with it that gets the taste buds going - not the pie or cushion - the dish itself is a marvel !
<br /><br />There's something very special about the bolognaise - the vegetables and herbs are so critical to the success that one often forgets the meat, which is indeed, probably a good thing !
<br /><br />So long as you've got some fleshy meat of any kind, you can make bolognaise.
<br /><br />The meat, while intrinsically important, is nothing more that the carrier of the flavour - the sauce !
<br /><br />The most important thing that bolognaise has is contained in the concept of that sauce.
<br /><br />So, to make a good bolognaise we need moisture, and the best moisture for cooking is wine !
<br /><br />The Basic Ragu - serves two
<br />===========================
<br /><br />1 large sprig rosemary - about a tablespoon when chopped loosley
<br />2 tin of tomatoes or 3 fresh tomatoes chopped
<br />3 1/2 an onion finely chopped
<br />4 1/2 teaspoon fresh chopped garlic
<br />5 salt and pepper to taste
<br />6 some meat - if your hungry, about 600g for two, otherwise 500 to 300g depending on your diet.
<br />7 Olive oil - if you like cooking, you must have and need olive oil in the house - use it at will !
<br />8 Oreganum
<br />9 half a big glass of red wine (190ml)
<br />10 pinch of sugar per person eating.
<br />11 fresh basil and thyme for decoration and added flavour.
<br /><br />Method
<br /><br />Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in pan.
<br />Add rosemary and fry for a few seconds.
<br />Add garlic and fry for a few seconds. (note, you can add this after the onions too if you want for a more garlically flavour)
<br />Add onion and fry for two minutes
<br />Add meat - at this point, you have to almost stir-fry the meat, trying to get it all cooked evenly  - maybe 5 to 8 minutes
<br />When 90% of the meat is lightly browned, add the red wine and cook till the wine fumes evapourate
<br />add in your Oreganum, tomatoes and mushrooms
<br />add salt and pepper to taste
<br />Add the pinches of sugar - a pinch is like 1/5 of a teaspoon.
<br />cover and simmer for 30 minutes.
<br />During simmering, add more wine if bolognaise is dry.
<br />Before serving add extra herbs like fresh basil or thyme if you want.
<br /><br />What you do after that is up to you - a nice salad and glass of dry white or red wine with some garlic bread is highly reccomended.
<br /><br />The quest for the perfect bolognaise, or should we say Ragu, continues !</div>]]></body></post><post id="p14074" date="Posted: Fri Oct 10, 2003 7:21 pm "><author>krankymonkee</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Very nice, I am hungry just reading, will have to try your steps sometime.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p14081" date="Posted: Fri Oct 10, 2003 9:05 pm "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Try to add the garlic last instead of first.

<br /><br />So, to make a good bolognaise we need moisture, and the best moisture for cooking is wine !
<br /><br />The Basic Ragu - serves two
<br />===========================
<br /><br />1 large sprig rosemary - about a tablespoon when chopped loosley
<br />2 tin of tomatoes or 3 fresh tomatoes chopped
<br />3 1/2 an onion finely chopped
<br />4 1/2 teaspoon fresh chopped garlic
<br />5 salt and pepper to taste
<br />6 some meat - if your hungry, about 600g for two, otherwise 500 to 300g depending on your diet.
<br />7 Olive oil - if you like cooking, you must have and need olive oil in the house - use it at will !
<br />8 Oreganum
<br />9 half a big glass of red wine (190ml)
<br />10 pinch of sugar per person eating.
<br />11 fresh basil and thyme for decoration and added flavour.
<br /><br />Method
<br /><br />Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in pan.
<br />Add rosemary and fry for a few seconds.
<br />Add garlic and fry for a few seconds. (note, you can add this after the onions too if you want for a more garlically flavour)
<br />Add onion and fry for two minutes
<br />Add meat - at this point, you have to almost stir-fry the meat, trying to get it all cooked evenly  - maybe 5 to 8 minutes
<br />When 90% of the meat is lightly browned, add the red wine and cook till the wine fumes evapourate
<br />add in your Oreganum, tomatoes and mushrooms
<br />add salt and pepper to taste
<br />Add the pinches of sugar - a pinch is like 1/5 of a teaspoon.
<br />cover and simmer for 30 minutes.
<br />During simmering, add more wine if bolognaise is dry.
<br />Before serving add extra herbs like fresh basil or thyme if you want.
<br /><br />What you do after that is up to you - a nice salad and glass of dry white or red wine with some garlic bread is highly reccomended.
<br /><br />The quest for the perfect bolognaise, or should we say Ragu, continues !</div>]]></body></post><post id="p14074" date="Posted: Fri Oct 10, 2003 7:21 pm "><author>krankymonkee</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Very nice, I am hungry just reading, will have to try your steps sometime.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p14081" date="Posted: Fri Oct 10, 2003 9:05 pm "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Try to add the garlic last instead of first.

<br /><br />The road to the perfecto bolognaise !
<br /><br />This is a tough road I'm embarking on - one frought with legend, heresay and solid evidence.
<br />But I need to travel that road of the cooking mind in my quest for "the perfect bolognaise", or, as it is traditionally known, <span style="font-weight: bold">ragu</span> !
<br /><br />To start, it has to be clearly stated that there is no real 'bolognaise' perfect dish - it always has and always will be open to interpretation.
<br /><br />To all intents and purposes, the bolognaise is nothing more than a stew with some meat in it - a treat for the poor of Italy some centuries past and for many years, a treat for much of the rest of the western world. Explaining that bolognaise is indeed a paupers dish is a bit like managing to miss the whoopee cushion and landing a very tasty pie in the face.
<br /><br />If you can figure that one out, your doing better than I am.
<br /><br />But it's what you do with it that gets the taste buds going - not the pie or cushion - the dish itself is a marvel !
<br /><br />There's something very special about the bolognaise - the vegetables and herbs are so critical to the success that one often forgets the meat, which is indeed, probably a good thing !
<br /><br />So long as you've got some fleshy meat of any kind, you can make bolognaise.
<br /><br />The meat, while intrinsically important, is nothing more that the carrier of the flavour - the sauce !
<br /><br />The most important thing that bolognaise has is contained in the concept of that sauce.
<br /><br />So, to make a good bolognaise we need moisture, and the best moisture for cooking is wine !
<br /><br />The Basic Ragu - serves two
<br />===========================
<br /><br />1 large sprig rosemary - about a tablespoon when chopped loosley
<br />2 tin of tomatoes or 3 fresh tomatoes chopped
<br />3 1/2 an onion finely chopped
<br />4 1/2 teaspoon fresh chopped garlic
<br />5 salt and pepper to taste
<br />6 some meat - if your hungry, about 600g for two, otherwise 500 to 300g depending on your diet.
<br />7 Olive oil - if you like cooking, you must have and need olive oil in the house - use it at will !
<br />8 Oreganum
<br />9 half a big glass of red wine (190ml)
<br />10 pinch of sugar per person eating.
<br />11 fresh basil and thyme for decoration and added flavour.

<br />Add garlic and fry for a few seconds. (note, you can add this after the onions too if you want for a more garlically flavour)
<br />Add onion and fry for two minutes
<br />Add meat - at this point, you have to almost stir-fry the meat, trying to get it all cooked evenly  - maybe 5 to 8 minutes
<br />When 90% of the meat is lightly browned, add the red wine and cook till the wine fumes evapourate
<br />add in your Oreganum, tomatoes and mushrooms
<br />add salt and pepper to taste
<br />Add the pinches of sugar - a pinch is like 1/5 of a teaspoon.

<br /><br />The road to the perfecto bolognaise !
<br /><br />This is a tough road I'm embarking on - one frought with legend, heresay and solid evidence.
<br />But I need to travel that road of the cooking mind in my quest for "the perfect bolognaise", or, as it is traditionally known, <span style="font-weight: bold">ragu</span> !
<br /><br />To start, it has to be clearly stated that there is no real 'bolognaise' perfect dish - it always has and always will be open to interpretation.
<br /><br />To all intents and purposes, the bolognaise is nothing more than a stew with some meat in it - a treat for the poor of Italy some centuries past and for many years, a treat for much of the rest of the western world. Explaining that bolognaise is indeed a paupers dish is a bit like managing to miss the whoopee cushion and landing a very tasty pie in the face.
<br /><br />If you can figure that one out, your doing better than I am.
<br /><br />But it's what you do with it that gets the taste buds going - not the pie or cushion - the dish itself is a marvel !
<br /><br />There's something very special about the bolognaise - the vegetables and herbs are so critical to the success that one often forgets the meat, which is indeed, probably a good thing !
<br /><br />So long as you've got some fleshy meat of any kind, you can make bolognaise.
<br /><br />The meat, while intrinsically important, is nothing more that the carrier of the flavour - the sauce !
<br /><br />The most important thing that bolognaise has is contained in the concept of that sauce.
<br /><br />So, to make a good bolognaise we need moisture, and the best moisture for cooking is wine !
<br /><br />The Basic Ragu - serves two
<br />===========================
<br /><br />1 large sprig rosemary - about a tablespoon when chopped loosley
<br />2 tin of tomatoes or 3 fresh tomatoes chopped
<br />3 1/2 an onion finely chopped
<br />4 1/2 teaspoon fresh chopped garlic
<br />5 salt and pepper to taste
<br />6 some meat - if your hungry, about 600g for two, otherwise 500 to 300g depending on your diet.
<br />7 Olive oil - if you like cooking, you must have and need olive oil in the house - use it at will !
<br />8 Oreganum
<br />9 half a big glass of red wine (190ml)
<br />10 pinch of sugar per person eating.
<br />11 fresh basil and thyme for decoration and added flavour.
<br /><br />Method
<br /><br />Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in pan.
<br />Add rosemary and fry for a few seconds.
<br />Add garlic and fry for a few seconds. (note, you can add this after the onions too if you want for a more garlically flavour)
<br />Add onion and fry for two minutes
<br />Add meat - at this point, you have to almost stir-fry the meat, trying to get it all cooked evenly  - maybe 5 to 8 minutes
<br />When 90% of the meat is lightly browned, add the red wine and cook till the wine fumes evapourate
<br />add in your Oreganum, tomatoes and mushrooms
<br />add salt and pepper to taste
<br />Add the pinches of sugar - a pinch is like 1/5 of a teaspoon.
<br />cover and simmer for 30 minutes.
<br />During simmering, add more wine if bolognaise is dry.
<br />Before serving add extra herbs like fresh basil or thyme if you want.
<br /><br />What you do after that is up to you - a nice salad and glass of dry white or red wine with some garlic bread is highly reccomended.
<br /><br />The quest for the perfect bolognaise, or should we say Ragu, continues !</div>]]></body></post><post id="p14074" date="Posted: Fri Oct 10, 2003 7:21 pm "><author>krankymonkee</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Very nice, I am hungry just reading, will have to try your steps sometime.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p14081" date="Posted: Fri Oct 10, 2003 9:05 pm "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Try to add the garlic last instead of first.

If you cook a whole clove (always works well roasted then the garlic is v sweet (and v tasty), you get more vampire repelant from crushed garlic in case antone is having problems with the living dead. 
<br /><br />is a must as is the wine, raises glass.
<br />freash chilli's are also needed, if you get an extreamly strong one it's possible to get the flavour just by slitting the chilli and removing it from the sauce once it's got it's required head, remember chilli does get hotter the more you cook it.
<br /><br />It's also a good point to know that the quality of the mince does make a big difference I always try to go for the steak mince although my girlfriend will tell you different. A bad workman always blames his tools, bah, that phrase is nonsence steak v crappy fatty meat that leaves horrid orange oil on the top of your bol is not what's needed here. for the perfect Bol I would recommend the finest steakmice from a decent local butchers.

<br /><br />The road to the perfecto bolognaise !

<br /><br />To start, it has to be clearly stated that there is no real 'bolognaise' perfect dish - it always has and always will be open to interpretation.
<br /><br />To all intents and purposes, the bolognaise is nothing more than a stew with some meat in it - a treat for the poor of Italy some centuries past and for many years, a treat for much of the rest of the western world. Explaining that bolognaise is indeed a paupers dish is a bit like managing to miss the whoopee cushion and landing a very tasty pie in the face.
<br /><br />If you can figure that one out, your doing better than I am.
<br /><br />But it's what you do with it that gets the taste buds going - not the pie or cushion - the dish itself is a marvel !
<br /><br />There's something very special about the bolognaise - the vegetables and herbs are so critical to the success that one often forgets the meat, which is indeed, probably a good thing !
<br /><br />So long as you've got some fleshy meat of any kind, you can make bolognaise.
<br /><br />The meat, while intrinsically important, is nothing more that the carrier of the flavour - the sauce !
<br /><br />The most important thing that bolognaise has is contained in the concept of that sauce.

<br /><br />The road to the perfecto bolognaise !
<br /><br />This is a tough road I'm embarking on - one frought with legend, heresay and solid evidence.
<br />But I need to travel that road of the cooking mind in my quest for "the perfect bolognaise", or, as it is traditionally known, <span style="font-weight: bold">ragu</span> !
<br /><br />To start, it has to be clearly stated that there is no real 'bolognaise' perfect dish - it always has and always will be open to interpretation.
<br /><br />To all intents and purposes, the bolognaise is nothing more than a stew with some meat in it - a treat for the poor of Italy some centuries past and for many years, a treat for much of the rest of the western world. Explaining that bolognaise is indeed a paupers dish is a bit like managing to miss the whoopee cushion and landing a very tasty pie in the face.
<br /><br />If you can figure that one out, your doing better than I am.
<br /><br />But it's what you do with it that gets the taste buds going - not the pie or cushion - the dish itself is a marvel !
<br /><br />There's something very special about the bolognaise - the vegetables and herbs are so critical to the success that one often forgets the meat, which is indeed, probably a good thing !
<br /><br />So long as you've got some fleshy meat of any kind, you can make bolognaise.
<br /><br />The meat, while intrinsically important, is nothing more that the carrier of the flavour - the sauce !
<br /><br />The most important thing that bolognaise has is contained in the concept of that sauce.
<br /><br />So, to make a good bolognaise we need moisture, and the best moisture for cooking is wine !
<br /><br />The Basic Ragu - serves two
<br />===========================
<br /><br />1 large sprig rosemary - about a tablespoon when chopped loosley
<br />2 tin of tomatoes or 3 fresh tomatoes chopped
<br />3 1/2 an onion finely chopped
<br />4 1/2 teaspoon fresh chopped garlic
<br />5 salt and pepper to taste
<br />6 some meat - if your hungry, about 600g for two, otherwise 500 to 300g depending on your diet.
<br />7 Olive oil - if you like cooking, you must have and need olive oil in the house - use it at will !
<br />8 Oreganum
<br />9 half a big glass of red wine (190ml)
<br />10 pinch of sugar per person eating.
<br />11 fresh basil and thyme for decoration and added flavour.
<br /><br />Method
<br /><br />Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in pan.
<br />Add rosemary and fry for a few seconds.
<br />Add garlic and fry for a few seconds. (note, you can add this after the onions too if you want for a more garlically flavour)
<br />Add onion and fry for two minutes
<br />Add meat - at this point, you have to almost stir-fry the meat, trying to get it all cooked evenly  - maybe 5 to 8 minutes
<br />When 90% of the meat is lightly browned, add the red wine and cook till the wine fumes evapourate
<br />add in your Oreganum, tomatoes and mushrooms
<br />add salt and pepper to taste
<br />Add the pinches of sugar - a pinch is like 1/5 of a teaspoon.
<br />cover and simmer for 30 minutes.
<br />During simmering, add more wine if bolognaise is dry.
<br />Before serving add extra herbs like fresh basil or thyme if you want.
<br /><br />What you do after that is up to you - a nice salad and glass of dry white or red wine with some garlic bread is highly reccomended.
<br /><br />The quest for the perfect bolognaise, or should we say Ragu, continues !</div>]]></body></post><post id="p14074" date="Posted: Fri Oct 10, 2003 7:21 pm "><author>krankymonkee</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Very nice, I am hungry just reading, will have to try your steps sometime.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p14081" date="Posted: Fri Oct 10, 2003 9:05 pm "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Try to add the garlic last instead of first.

<br /><br />Get yourself some good parmesan cheese (which I refer to as smelly-sock-cheese)
<br /><br />I'll have to introduce everyone to another great recipie that I've perfected - a chicken tagine - but it's really complicated and uses like 25 different ingredients, one of which is preserved lemons ! - it's pretty exotic and is a moroccan dish, but it's damn tasty. At least 30 minutes preparation time tho. The name is a bit misleading as a Tagine is a special pottery caserol dish - it's got a conical lid.
<br /><br />And then there's the curry I've finally got down perfect, with the help of Magic Masala, Garam masala and freshly chopped coriander leaves - tastes totally authentic. It's taken me 10 years to get to the point of making a curry worthy of an indian restaurant !</div>]]></body></post><post id="p14140" date="Posted: Sat Oct 11, 2003 3:53 pm "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Soon enough I'll conquer the world with my overy simple yet perfect tasting Risotto!

<br /><br />The road to the perfecto bolognaise !
<br /><br />This is a tough road I'm embarking on - one frought with legend, heresay and solid evidence.
<br />But I need to travel that road of the cooking mind in my quest for "the perfect bolognaise", or, as it is traditionally known, <span style="font-weight: bold">ragu</span> !
<br /><br />To start, it has to be clearly stated that there is no real 'bolognaise' perfect dish - it always has and always will be open to interpretation.
<br /><br />To all intents and purposes, the bolognaise is nothing more than a stew with some meat in it - a treat for the poor of Italy some centuries past and for many years, a treat for much of the rest of the western world. Explaining that bolognaise is indeed a paupers dish is a bit like managing to miss the whoopee cushion and landing a very tasty pie in the face.
<br /><br />If you can figure that one out, your doing better than I am.
<br /><br />But it's what you do with it that gets the taste buds going - not the pie or cushion - the dish itself is a marvel !
<br /><br />There's something very special about the bolognaise - the vegetables and herbs are so critical to the success that one often forgets the meat, which is indeed, probably a good thing !
<br /><br />So long as you've got some fleshy meat of any kind, you can make bolognaise.
<br /><br />The meat, while intrinsically important, is nothing more that the carrier of the flavour - the sauce !
<br /><br />The most important thing that bolognaise has is contained in the concept of that sauce.
<br /><br />So, to make a good bolognaise we need moisture, and the best moisture for cooking is wine !
<br /><br />The Basic Ragu - serves two
<br />===========================
<br /><br />1 large sprig rosemary - about a tablespoon when chopped loosley
<br />2 tin of tomatoes or 3 fresh tomatoes chopped
<br />3 1/2 an onion finely chopped
<br />4 1/2 teaspoon fresh chopped garlic
<br />5 salt and pepper to taste
<br />6 some meat - if your hungry, about 600g for two, otherwise 500 to 300g depending on your diet.
<br />7 Olive oil - if you like cooking, you must have and need olive oil in the house - use it at will !
<br />8 Oreganum
<br />9 half a big glass of red wine (190ml)
<br />10 pinch of sugar per person eating.
<br />11 fresh basil and thyme for decoration and added flavour.
<br /><br />Method
<br /><br />Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in pan.
<br />Add rosemary and fry for a few seconds.
<br />Add garlic and fry for a few seconds. (note, you can add this after the onions too if you want for a more garlically flavour)
<br />Add onion and fry for two minutes
<br />Add meat - at this point, you have to almost stir-fry the meat, trying to get it all cooked evenly  - maybe 5 to 8 minutes
<br />When 90% of the meat is lightly browned, add the red wine and cook till the wine fumes evapourate
<br />add in your Oreganum, tomatoes and mushrooms
<br />add salt and pepper to taste
<br />Add the pinches of sugar - a pinch is like 1/5 of a teaspoon.
<br />cover and simmer for 30 minutes.
<br />During simmering, add more wine if bolognaise is dry.
<br />Before serving add extra herbs like fresh basil or thyme if you want.
<br /><br />What you do after that is up to you - a nice salad and glass of dry white or red wine with some garlic bread is highly reccomended.
<br /><br />The quest for the perfect bolognaise, or should we say Ragu, continues !</div>]]></body></post><post id="p14074" date="Posted: Fri Oct 10, 2003 7:21 pm "><author>krankymonkee</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Very nice, I am hungry just reading, will have to try your steps sometime.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p14081" date="Posted: Fri Oct 10, 2003 9:05 pm "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Try to add the garlic last instead of first.

<br />really, a good fish or steak is an art.
<br />but i think i'll give one of these recipies a try.
<br />for meat, what do you think, ground beef, or pork?
<br /><br />bb: 1 tin doesnt help, ounces would. and do we want peeled? sliced? chopped?
<br />oreganum=oregano?
<br />and for sugar, if this is like a spaghatti sauce, i find that honey is the best sweetener.
<br />and olive oil: you like vergin, extra vergin, or light?

<br /><br />For two people, I'd say 3 small italian tomatoes are good.
<br /><br />Olive oil - extra virgin is always best, but it's also damn expensive.
<br /><br />If you don't have red wine, you can add half a teaspoon of balsamic vinegar (be carefuly how much you add)
<br /><br />Thanks for the tip about the garlic BNA - and a bit of a history lesson !
<br /><br />Another cool addition is chopped bacon, which you can fry with rosemary before adding the onions.
<br /><br />The best meat is beef - ground beef is called mince in the UK, south africa, australia and new zealand.
<br /><br />Some people advocate getting a really cheap cut of meat of the bone and getting your butcher to grind that - cheap meat of the bone has the best flavour, but it's also the toughest, when it's ground you won't notice it.

This is my first post here and I'm italian, so maybe I can help a bit (-:
<br />I don't eat ragu' 'cause I'm vegetarian, but I've eated it so much in past, and my grandmother's continuing to do it.
<br />I've not personally ever cooked ragu' on my own, but I'm pretty sure that the garlic is not present at all.
<br />Secondly, the *real* ragu' does not cook for only 30 minutes, but for 3-4 hours at least.
<br /><br />Ragu' is not a spaghetti sauce. Here in italy we're not use it on spaghetti, but on other type of pasta that sets off his taste, like lasagne or tortelloni.
<br />Tortelloni is a real simple recipe to do, it's a pasta full of 'ricotta' cheese and spinach. If you want to hear more just tell me (-:

<br /><br />I've variated my original bolognaise recipie somewhat since this original post.
<br />I use a bit more rosemary, and a few pinches of treacle sugar (that dark sticky sugar) - I'm also putting in more olive oil and cutting the onions up incredibly fine.
<br /><br />Interesting about the ragu there Pinhead - I want to try make a veg one that I'll cook for some hours.
<br /><br />I'm also cooking lasagne, but that takes a bit longer - my cheese sauce is totally decadant too, I use full cream, cheddar and parmesan and don't bother with any kinda flour in it  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /><br /><br />BTW, edited my original recipie - forgot to mention I usually put the rosemary in at the very beggining.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p50716" date="Posted: Thu Sep 16, 2004 12:11 pm "><author>Pinhead from Outer Space</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Ok, I asked to my grandmother and she said that you can use grinded beef or pork either. Maybe there are two different school of thought here.
<br />She said also that there's no sugar nor treacle (or anyway she don't use it).
<br />For a vegetarian-like ragu' I use some vegetables (carrots, onions, etc...), some spices, and a soya-based compound that I buy at my vegetarian shop of choice.
<br /><br />Yeah, lasagne is a long and not so easy to do stuff. I suggest you to buy the preparation in a shop for the pasta, and then using ragu', bechamel and parmesan as seasoning before cooking it in you oven.
<br /><br />Ok, and now Tortelloni with ragu':
<br />take the flour, set it on your table of work and make a hole in the centre, so it's look like a volcano. Put one eggs (per 100gr of flour) in the hole and a bit of salt and start mixing with a fork at the beginning and with your hands after a while. Continue to work the kneading until it will be smooth and compact (if you need, you can strew you table of work with flour to avoid the mixing to stick on the table). Now just leave it under a cloth for a while.
<br />Well, congratulations, you've done your first egg-based pasta (-:
<br />Prepare the filling: grind some parmesan and put it with come ricotta cheese, salt and spinach (the spinach must be cooked and grinded of course) and mix them.
<br />Now you've to stretch tha pasta and cut it in squares. Put a nut of filling in the middle of the squre and close it on itself. Now you've a triangle. Close every side of the triangle and then join the vertex of the base turning them around your index. It's more difficult saying than doing it.
<br />Ok, now you've got your pasta, cook it and season it with your home-made ragu' (-:
<br />Good appetite!

<br /><br />Serving 4 people, or a hungry gamer for 2 nights
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What you need</span>
<br /><br />1 tablespoon oil, take your pick, verign, veg, etc
<br />1 med onion, sliced
<br />1 clove garlic - FRESH
<br />3 rashers rinless bacon, sliced into chuncks
<br />1 1/2 cups of button muchsrooms - sliced. You can use the big ones, but buttons have more flavor for this
<br />1 x 410 Gram can of cream of chicken, or cream of chicken and mushroom soup. I like to use Campbells, but not every one can get this brand, so use a quilty soup
<br />1/2 cup of watter
<br />350 Grams of Fettuccine, cooked and drained - I like to use Barilla, or Zafarelli, but use what you like, even fresh pasta, as above
<br />Parmesan Chesse for that extra zing
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">How to make it</span>
<br /><br />1. Heat oil in a medium sauce pan, and cook onion, garlic, bacon, and mushroom, untill tender.
<br /><br />2. Add soup and watter, then simmer for 5 mins
<br /><br />3. Pour soup mixture over hot Fettuccine, then add your chesse
<br /><br />Enjoy!
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">NOTES</span>
<br /><br />Though this is for Fettuccine, you can use a scoop pasta, such as elbos, as well, though this is not for a Spegetiy pasta
<br /><br />When we cook this, we normaly put 1/4 cup of mixed veg on the plate as well, becuase the meal has no vitavams, other then the shrooms

<br />I don't know if you're referring to italian pasta dishes, but here we almost never use oil, onions and garlic in combo. The most famous receipt that use garlic and oil maybe is Spaghetti with garlic, oil and chilli. Just take an handful of spaghetti, cook it as usual, strain it and then season it with olive oil, garlic's fresh pieces and istantly-grinded chilli as you want. (-:

<br />I don't eat ragu' 'cause I'm vegetarian, but I've eated it so much in past, and my grandmother's continuing to do it.
<br />I've not personally ever cooked ragu' on my own, but I'm pretty sure that the garlic is not present at all.
<br />Secondly, the *real* ragu' does not cook for only 30 minutes, but for 3-4 hours at least.
<br /><br />Ragu' is not a spaghetti sauce. Here in italy we're not use it on spaghetti, but on other type of pasta that sets off his taste, like lasagne or tortelloni.
<br />Tortelloni is a real simple recipe to do, it's a pasta full of 'ricotta' cheese and spinach. If you want to hear more just tell me (-:

<br />Now you've to stretch tha pasta and cut it in squares. Put a nut of filling in the middle of the squre and close it on itself. Now you've a triangle. Close every side of the triangle and then join the vertex of the base turning them around your index. It's more difficult saying than doing it.
<br />Ok, now you've got your pasta, cook it and season it with your home-made ragu' (-:
<br />Good appetite!
<br /><br /><br />ps. here you can find some pics, although is written in italian.

<br /><br />Serving 4 people, or a hungry gamer for 2 nights
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What you need</span>
<br /><br />1 tablespoon oil, take your pick, verign, veg, etc
<br />1 med onion, sliced
<br />1 clove garlic - FRESH
<br />3 rashers rinless bacon, sliced into chuncks
<br />1 1/2 cups of button muchsrooms - sliced. You can use the big ones, but buttons have more flavor for this
<br />1 x 410 Gram can of cream of chicken, or cream of chicken and mushroom soup. I like to use Campbells, but not every one can get this brand, so use a quilty soup
<br />1/2 cup of watter
<br />350 Grams of Fettuccine, cooked and drained - I like to use Barilla, or Zafarelli, but use what you like, even fresh pasta, as above
<br />Parmesan Chesse for that extra zing
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">How to make it</span>
<br /><br />1. Heat oil in a medium sauce pan, and cook onion, garlic, bacon, and mushroom, untill tender.
<br /><br />2. Add soup and watter, then simmer for 5 mins
<br /><br />3. Pour soup mixture over hot Fettuccine, then add your chesse
<br /><br />Enjoy!
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">NOTES</span>
<br /><br />Though this is for Fettuccine, you can use a scoop pasta, such as elbos, as well, though this is not for a Spegetiy pasta
<br /><br />When we cook this, we normaly put 1/4 cup of mixed veg on the plate as well, becuase the meal has no vitavams, other then the shrooms

<br />Eheheh, you've to leave the pasta drying after you've filled it. And then cook it as any other pasta that you buy in the shop. But this home-made one is quicker to cook. Just put it in boiling water with an handful of salt, and when the pasta come on the surface, leave it another 1/2 minutes and then strain it. Happy cooking! (-:

<br />I don't know if you're referring to italian pasta dishes, but here we almost never use oil, onions and garlic in combo. The most famous receipt that use garlic and oil maybe is Spaghetti with garlic, oil and chilli. Just take an handful of spaghetti, cook it as usual, strain it and then season it with olive oil, garlic's fresh pieces and istantly-grinded chilli as you want. (-:

Maybe there are two different school of thought here.
<br />She said also that there's no sugar nor treacle (or anyway she don't use it).
<br />For a vegetarian-like ragu' I use some vegetables (carrots, onions, etc...), some spices, and a soya-based compound that I buy at my vegetarian shop of choice.
<br /><br />Yeah, lasagne is a long and not so easy to do stuff. I suggest you to buy the preparation in a shop for the pasta, and then using ragu', bechamel and parmesan as seasoning before cooking it in you oven.
<br /><br />Ok, and now Tortelloni with ragu':
<br />take the flour, set it on your table of work and make a hole in the centre, so it's look like a volcano. Put one eggs (per 100gr of flour) in the hole and a bit of salt and start mixing with a fork at the beginning and with your hands after a while. Continue to work the kneading until it will be smooth and compact (if you need, you can strew you table of work with flour to avoid the mixing to stick on the table). Now just leave it under a cloth for a while.
<br />Well, congratulations, you've done your first egg-based pasta (-:

She said also that there's no sugar nor treacle (or anyway she don't use it).&#13;
<br/>
For a vegetarian-like ragu' I use some vegetables (carrots, onions, etc...), some spices, and a soya-based compound that I buy at my vegetarian shop of choice.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Yeah, lasagne is a long and not so easy to do stuff. I suggest you to buy the preparation in a shop for the pasta, and then using ragu', bechamel and parmesan as seasoning before cooking it in you oven.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Ok, and now Tortelloni with ragu':&#13;
<br/>
take the flour, set it on your table of work and make a hole in the centre, so it's look like a volcano. Put one eggs (per 100gr of flour) in the hole and a bit of salt and start mixing with a fork at the beginning and with your hands after a while. Continue to work the kneading until it will be smooth and compact (if you need, you can strew you table of work with flour to avoid the mixing to stick on the table). Now just leave it under a cloth for a while.&#13;
<br/>
Well, congratulations, you've done your first egg-based pasta (-:&#13;
<br/>
Prepare the filling: grind some parmesan and put it with come ricotta cheese, salt and spinach (the spinach must be cooked and grinded of course) and mix them.&#13;
<br/>
Now you've to stretch tha pasta and cut it in squares. Put a nut of filling in the middle of the squre and close it on itself. Now you've a triangle. Close every side of the triangle and then join the vertex of the base turning them around your index. It's more difficult saying than doing it.&#13;
<br/>
Ok, now you've got your pasta, cook it and season it with your home-made ragu' (-:&#13;
<br/>
Good appetite!&#13;

I'm currently cooking for my late lunch tray baked lamb chops with roast potatoes/sweet potatoes and baking some tomatoes with fresh basil/garlic/bayleaves baby leaks, sprinkled with balsamic vinegar and olive oil, I've also knocked together some home made mint sauce - hmmmm, tasty !&#13;
<br/><br/>
I'll post a recipie for that some day, but it's pretty easy. Man, I love cooking, simply because I like eating tasty food ! &#13;

Amen to tossing in red wine... in my mind, that's what seperates the good sauces from the mediocre.  &#13;

Also, I agree with both BNA and matt about the garlic... that is, I usually sautee some with onions and olive oil... and then add a bit more when the whole thing is done, simmering, and mixing flavors.&#13;

<br/><br/>
Serving 4 people, or a hungry gamer for 2 nights&#13;
<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">What you need</span>&#13;
<br/><br/>
1 tablespoon oil, take your pick, verign, veg, etc&#13;
<br/>
1 med onion, sliced&#13;
<br/>
1 clove garlic - FRESH&#13;
<br/>
3 rashers rinless bacon, sliced into chuncks&#13;
<br/>
1 1/2 cups of button muchsrooms - sliced. You can use the big ones, but buttons have more flavor for this&#13;
<br/>
1 x 410 Gram can of cream of chicken, or cream of chicken and mushroom soup. I like to use Campbells, but not every one can get this brand, so use a quilty soup&#13;
<br/>
1/2 cup of watter&#13;
<br/>
350 Grams of Fettuccine, cooked and drained - I like to use Barilla, or Zafarelli, but use what you like, even fresh pasta, as above&#13;
<br/>
Parmesan Chesse for that extra zing&#13;
<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">How to make it</span>&#13;
<br/><br/>
1. Heat oil in a medium sauce pan, and cook onion, garlic, bacon, and mushroom, untill tender.&#13;
<br/><br/>
2. Add soup and watter, then simmer for 5 mins&#13;
<br/><br/>
3. Pour soup mixture over hot Fettuccine, then add your chesse&#13;
<br/><br/>
Enjoy!&#13;
<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">NOTES</span>&#13;
<br/><br/>
Though this is for Fettuccine, you can use a scoop pasta, such as elbos, as well, though this is not for a Spegetiy pasta&#13;
<br/><br/>
When we cook this, we normaly put 1/4 cup of mixed veg on the plate as well, becuase the meal has no vitavams, other then the shrooms&#13;

Eheheh, you've to leave the pasta drying after you've filled it. And then cook it as any other pasta that you buy in the shop. But this home-made one is quicker to cook. Just put it in boiling water with an handful of salt, and when the pasta come on the surface, leave it another 1/2 minutes and then strain it. Happy cooking! (-:&#13;

I don't know if you're referring to italian pasta dishes, but here we almost never use oil, onions and garlic in combo. The most famous receipt that use garlic and oil maybe is Spaghetti with garlic, oil and chilli. Just take an handful of spaghetti, cook it as usual, strain it and then season it with olive oil, garlic's fresh pieces and istantly-grinded chilli as you want. (-:&#13;
<br/>
It's a great easy-making combo! (-:<br/>_________________<br/>"We must find out what words are and how they function. They become images when written down, but images of words repeated in the mind and not of the image of the thing itself." W.S. Burroughs</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

<br />Secondly, the *real* ragu' does not cook for only 30 minutes, but for 3-4 hours at least.
<br /><br />Ragu' is not a spaghetti sauce. Here in italy we're not use it on spaghetti, but on other type of pasta that sets off his taste, like lasagne or tortelloni.
<br />Tortelloni is a real simple recipe to do, it's a pasta full of 'ricotta' cheese and spinach. If you want to hear more just tell me (-:
<br />Hoping I've raised your appetite (-:

<br /><br />I've variated my original bolognaise recipie somewhat since this original post.
<br />I use a bit more rosemary, and a few pinches of treacle sugar (that dark sticky sugar) - I'm also putting in more olive oil and cutting the onions up incredibly fine.
<br /><br />Interesting about the ragu there Pinhead - I want to try make a veg one that I'll cook for some hours.
<br /><br />I'm also cooking lasagne, but that takes a bit longer - my cheese sauce is totally decadant too, I use full cream, cheddar and parmesan and don't bother with any kinda flour in it  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /><br /><br />BTW, edited my original recipie - forgot to mention I usually put the rosemary in at the very beggining.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p50716" date="Posted: Thu Sep 16, 2004 12:11 pm "><author>Pinhead from Outer Space</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Ok, I asked to my grandmother and she said that you can use grinded beef or pork either. Maybe there are two different school of thought here.
<br />She said also that there's no sugar nor treacle (or anyway she don't use it).
<br />For a vegetarian-like ragu' I use some vegetables (carrots, onions, etc...), some spices, and a soya-based compound that I buy at my vegetarian shop of choice.
<br /><br />Yeah, lasagne is a long and not so easy to do stuff. I suggest you to buy the preparation in a shop for the pasta, and then using ragu', bechamel and parmesan as seasoning before cooking it in you oven.
<br /><br />Ok, and now Tortelloni with ragu':
<br />take the flour, set it on your table of work and make a hole in the centre, so it's look like a volcano. Put one eggs (per 100gr of flour) in the hole and a bit of salt and start mixing with a fork at the beginning and with your hands after a while. Continue to work the kneading until it will be smooth and compact (if you need, you can strew you table of work with flour to avoid the mixing to stick on the table). Now just leave it under a cloth for a while.
<br />Well, congratulations, you've done your first egg-based pasta (-:
<br />Prepare the filling: grind some parmesan and put it with come ricotta cheese, salt and spinach (the spinach must be cooked and grinded of course) and mix them.
<br />Now you've to stretch tha pasta and cut it in squares. Put a nut of filling in the middle of the squre and close it on itself. Now you've a triangle. Close every side of the triangle and then join the vertex of the base turning them around your index. It's more difficult saying than doing it.
<br />Ok, now you've got your pasta, cook it and season it with your home-made ragu' (-:
<br />Good appetite!
<br /><br /><br />ps. here you can find some pics, although is written in italian.

<br /><br />So, you just boil the pasta as you would with stuff bought in the shop ?
<br />Hmm, I'll try it, but I'll bet I'll stuff it up somewhere along the line - I can imagine a soggy pile of goo in the pot when I try to boil my pasta <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />I'm currently cooking for my late lunch tray baked lamb chops with roast potatoes/sweet potatoes and baking some tomatoes with fresh basil/garlic/bayleaves baby leaks, sprinkled with balsamic vinegar and olive oil, I've also knocked together some home made mint sauce - hmmmm, tasty !
<br /><br />I'll post a recipie for that some day, but it's pretty easy. Man, I love cooking, simply because I like eating tasty food ! 
<br />Screw junk food - it's crap.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p51132" date="Posted: Fri Sep 17, 2004 4:33 pm "><author>goliathvt</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I just saw this thread for the first time... somehow missed it before.
<br /><br />Amen to tossing in red wine... in my mind, that's what seperates the good sauces from the mediocre.  
<br /><br />And yup, the holy trinity--olive oil, onions, garlic--always have their place in just about every pasta dish I've ever made.
<br /><br />Also, I agree with both BNA and matt about the garlic... that is, I usually sautee some with onions and olive oil... and then add a bit more when the whole thing is done, simmering, and mixing flavors.
<br /><br />What can I say... I'm a garlicoholic and proud of it.

<br /><br />Serving 4 people, or a hungry gamer for 2 nights
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What you need</span>
<br /><br />1 tablespoon oil, take your pick, verign, veg, etc
<br />1 med onion, sliced
<br />1 clove garlic - FRESH
<br />3 rashers rinless bacon, sliced into chuncks
<br />1 1/2 cups of button muchsrooms - sliced. You can use the big ones, but buttons have more flavor for this
<br />1 x 410 Gram can of cream of chicken, or cream of chicken and mushroom soup. I like to use Campbells, but not every one can get this brand, so use a quilty soup
<br />1/2 cup of watter
<br />350 Grams of Fettuccine, cooked and drained - I like to use Barilla, or Zafarelli, but use what you like, even fresh pasta, as above
<br />Parmesan Chesse for that extra zing
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">How to make it</span>
<br /><br />1. Heat oil in a medium sauce pan, and cook onion, garlic, bacon, and mushroom, untill tender.
<br /><br />2. Add soup and watter, then simmer for 5 mins
<br /><br />3. Pour soup mixture over hot Fettuccine, then add your chesse
<br /><br />Enjoy!
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">NOTES</span>
<br /><br />Though this is for Fettuccine, you can use a scoop pasta, such as elbos, as well, though this is not for a Spegetiy pasta
<br /><br />When we cook this, we normaly put 1/4 cup of mixed veg on the plate as well, becuase the meal has no vitavams, other then the shrooms

<br />Eheheh, you've to leave the pasta drying after you've filled it. And then cook it as any other pasta that you buy in the shop. But this home-made one is quicker to cook. Just put it in boiling water with an handful of salt, and when the pasta come on the surface, leave it another 1/2 minutes and then strain it. Happy cooking! (-:
<br /><br /><br />goliathvt:
<br />I don't know if you're referring to italian pasta dishes, but here we almost never use oil, onions and garlic in combo. The most famous receipt that use garlic and oil maybe is Spaghetti with garlic, oil and chilli. Just take an handful of spaghetti, cook it as usual, strain it and then season it with olive oil, garlic's fresh pieces and istantly-grinded chilli as you want. (-:
<br />It's a great easy-making combo!

<br />I dont have red wine. I used Balsimic vinegar in about a cup of water instead.
<br />Instead of sugar, try honey.
<br /><br />It turned out great. perhaps i shoulda used more garlic and onions to suit my taste... I also added a red jalapeno to spice it up a bit.
<br /><br />in all, a great recipie.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p138624" date="Posted: Fri Mar 31, 2006 7:31 am "><author>Qwertys</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I tried it again tonight. Those of you who havn't tried this recipie, DO IT. It's awesome.
<br />Many thanks to bb_matt for posting this recipie, and to the many tips from BNA and others. I was able to use red wine this time. I added 1 can of tomato sause too to add a little more juice (i hope i did not commit a sin)
<br />I put in 1-1/2 tbsp of honey instead of sugar. turned out great!
<br />I moved up the amount of onion to 2/3rds an onion and 2 cloves of garlic. us americans love our garlic. and 1lb of 93% ground beef.
<br />turned out awesome, a very flavorful taste but not too strong and not too spicy. i could eat this stuff all year long.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p138630" date="Posted: Fri Mar 31, 2006 8:40 am "><author>smurkenstein</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">cover and simmer for 30 minutes. </div>
<br /><br />Aye, what pinead said. The "authentic" recipe I have (not the one I have used, I might add) starts cooking the day before, with slow reduction/disolution of the meat joint into a baking tin shallow with with water. The remainder of the meat is served with veggies, and the sauce presented as a starter with the pasta. I'll try to scan the pages and post (probably monday).</div>]]></body></post></posts></thread></xml>
