I looked around but could not find anything telling me what I most want to know right now. Is it possible to edit the existing Q4 md5 files that came with the game?? For example, can I take the  machinegun "view.md5" mesh and revamp this with my own model weapon? And can I use the games animating md5 files"fire.md5" for the machine gun except with my custom model, Or do I have to make a new animation for my weapon? If I can change the associations so they are correct , is this even possible? Ok thats more than one question, but these things have been burning in my mind. Any help or point in the right direction, is GREATLY APPRECIATED !! I am running Maya 6, and I have 1.4 beta patch installed with 1.4 sdk in Q4.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p170564" date="Posted: Wed Feb 14, 2007 8:10 pm "><author>der_ton</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Yes all of this is possible, I'm sure there are some threads about this already, maybe not in this Quake4 Modelling subforum, but in the Doom3 one.
