Being that the alpha is impossible to find anymore, i tried to load them in my retail doom 3 installation, but the textures that the levels need arent in the files.   I could try again and give an exact error message, but i do know that if i open one in the editor a lot of the textures show up as missing.  Any ideas on how to get them working?  The editor is uber confusing to me, and likes to crash a lot.  Any help would be appreciated.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p193134" date="Posted: Tue Dec 25, 2007 5:34 am "><author>rich_is_bored</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Broken material shaders are usually the result of missing image files.
