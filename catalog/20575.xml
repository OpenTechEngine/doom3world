  <div class="quotecontent">Challenge ProMode Arena is looking to put together a small but focused art team to develop content to our specifications and release it under a Creative Commons license so that it may be used throughout the mod and indie gaming community.<br /><br />Each member will be required to work with the art and development teams to create assets to replace the stock id work within Quake 3. The dev team will supply technical details in order to make the most of any engine modifications and visual requirements to ensure that art compliments gameplay.<br /><br />No one has ever made any money working on CPMA and the art team will be no different. It's a community project to create a quality, free, standalone game with art that can benefit the wider indie gaming community through permissive Creative Commons licenses.<br /><br />Since we are populating the art division from scratch we are currently looking for all types of art relevent to a FPS project. This includes 2D (textures, design, skins, concepts), 3D (players, items, weapons) and sound. Visual artists should ideally have at least some experience in developing for Quake 3 Arena as well as recent engines supporting features like bump &amp; specular mapping.<br /><br />Challenge ProMode Arena is a fast, competition oriented game and currently the most widely used Quake 3 mod under active development with members known throughout the gaming community for their work.
