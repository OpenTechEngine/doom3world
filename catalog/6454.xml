<br /><br />The above "tweak guide" is very good, but it stops at the mouse inputs and says nothing about the keyboard <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319222927im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":-(" title="Sad" /><br /><br />However, persistence has paid off and I have found the answer(s) to my problem of using a joystick (only) with Doom 3.
<br /><br />in the DoomConfig.cfg file you will see two lines of code:
<br /><br />seta in_pitchspeed "140"
<br />seta in_yawspeed "140"
<br /><br />These essentially are the values for the "repeat rate" of the 'keys' that are bound to the "Look" and "Left/Right" (respectively). I have changed both of the above to "35" (I might go a little higher...).
<br /><br />The joystick has sensitivity and axis options as well, so obviously this will be different for other joysticks. I have the twelve button Logitech Extreme 3D Pro which has a good overall button layout - ie - good top and other keys on bottom left. A handy (no pun intended) button near fire is great for reload also.
<br /><br />A spin off of this is that by changing the above (seta's) you can also plant both hands firmly on the keyboard and play just fine! Remember Doom 1?
<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I am not afraid of mice (get off the chair now - lol) it's just more convenient to play in the dark with a single controller...
<br /><br />Cheers
