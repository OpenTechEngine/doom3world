If I am correct the map format undo goes just like Doom3, all in text. Like rich said you still would need to apply the textures. The entities I think would not be a big problem unless they go under a different name then Half Life or they are stored in another file with more data. Their mite be converters out their for it. If not and you REALLY want to make your own. <br /><br />I hope you have fun learning. It is not a 1 hour kind of project. I know, because I have been working on getting a .3ds model formate into my game in C++ and yet still can't it to work properly.  <img src="/web/20071227193813im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_mad.gif" alt=":x" title="Mad" /><br /><br />Any how that's what I think on the problem, I know I didn't help that much.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p192849" date="Posted: Thu Dec 20, 2007 12:48 am "><author>hardcore_gamer</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">It sounds like just learning to use hammer properly would a better thing to do then.
