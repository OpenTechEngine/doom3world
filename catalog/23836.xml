This video was recorded at 1080p clientside connected to a dedicated server. The showcased MCS group consists of two human players (the wife &amp; me) and one friendly MCS AI player cooperatively fighting our way through a custom community made Doom3 map. One of the most important yet to implement features will be the change of Doom3's netcode from currently "forward predicted" to "running behind the server" method. As soon as the Doom3 Source Code will be released later this year, that change, along with an improved projectile code, will ensure that clientside latency will become a much less influentual factor of the player's multiplayer cooperative gameplay experience. In order to speed up this process and thereby move faster towards a public build release, we welcome every interested &amp; experienced c++ game programmer to join us in achieving the targeted goals. <br /><br />Interested people can drop us a mail at <!-- e --><a href="mailto:oneofthe8devilz@hotmail.com">oneofthe8devilz@hotmail.com</a><!-- e --> and we will be happy to provide you with all the tools and codebases required to get you started...<br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319220505im_/http://www.scared-pixel-studios.com/public/images/mcs/mcs_09_2011_gameplay_walkthrough.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319220505/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdKgHWVQSUc&amp;hd=1" class="postlink">youtube gameplay video link</a><br /><br />-==May 2011 Progress==-<br /><br />Amoung many other SP Campaign related updates the gametype "DemonWars" was added to MCS which offers a more action/combat focused way to play the game outside the SP Campaign fighting against the Legions of Hell on Earth being humanity's last line of defense.<br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319220505im_/http://www.scared-pixel-studios.com/public/images/mcs/mcs_gameplay_p.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319220505/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv__Ag2uqr8&amp;hd=1" class="postlink">youtube gameplay video link</a><br /><br />-==February 2011 Progress==-<br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319220505im_/http://www.scared-pixel-studios.com/public/images/mcs/mcs_02_2011_p.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319220505/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD8cIY7TfjQ&amp;hd=1" class="postlink">youtube gameplay video link</a><br /><br />-==January 2011 Progress==-<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic">After the long awaited Sikkmod 1.0 source release the new features are slowly but surely making it into MCS <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319220505im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br />Here a shot of the freshly ported SSAO  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319220505im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8)" title="Cool" /></span>   <br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319220505im_/http://www.scared-pixel-studios.com/public/images/mcs/mcs_ssao_p.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><br />-==December 2010 Progress==-<br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319220505im_/http://www.scared-pixel-studios.com/public/images/mcs/mcs_dec_2010_1_p.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319220505/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tue0a8SPjTY&amp;hd=1" class="postlink">youtube gameplay video link</a></div>]]></body></post><post id="p226518" date="Posted: Wed Aug 18, 2010 2:50 pm "><author>Gzegzolka</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">On video it look awesome as every game that could be played in coop <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319220505im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> .

This video was recorded at 1080p clientside connected to a dedicated server. The showcased MCS group consists of two human players (the wife &amp; me) and one friendly MCS AI player cooperatively fighting our way through a custom community made Doom3 map. One of the most important yet to implement features will be the change of Doom3's netcode from currently "forward predicted" to "running behind the server" method. As soon as the Doom3 Source Code will be released later this year, that change, along with an improved projectile code, will ensure that clientside latency will become a much less influentual factor of the player's multiplayer cooperative gameplay experience.

This video was recorded at 1080p clientside connected to a dedicated server. The showcased MCS group consists of two human players (the wife &amp; me) and one friendly MCS AI player cooperatively fighting our way through a custom community made Doom3 map. One of the most important yet to implement features will be the change of Doom3's netcode from currently "forward predicted" to "running behind the server" method. As soon as the Doom3 Source Code will be released later this year, that change, along with an improved projectile code, will ensure that clientside latency will become a much less influentual factor of the player's multiplayer cooperative gameplay experience.

This video was recorded at 1080p clientside connected to a dedicated server. The showcased MCS group consists of two human players (the wife &amp; me) and one friendly MCS AI player cooperatively fighting our way through a custom community made Doom3 map. One of the most important yet to implement features will be the change of Doom3's netcode from currently "forward predicted" to "running behind the server" method. As soon as the Doom3 Source Code will be released later this year, that change, along with an improved projectile code, will ensure that clientside latency will become a much less influentual factor of the player's multiplayer cooperative gameplay experience. In order to speed up this process and thereby move faster towards a public build release, we welcome every interested &amp; experienced c++ game programmer to join us in achieving the targeted goals. <br /><br />Interested people can drop us a mail at <!-- e --><a href="mailto:oneofthe8devilz@hotmail.com">oneofthe8devilz@hotmail.com</a><!-- e --> and we will be happy to provide you with all the tools and codebases required to get you started...<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319220752/http://www.scared-pixel-studios.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=565" class="postlink">Credits to the Doom3 Community</a><br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319220752im_/http://www.scared-pixel-studios.com/public/images/mcs/mcs_09_2011_gameplay_walkthrough.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />youtube gameplay video link: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319220752/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdKgHWVQSUc&amp;hd=1">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdKgHWVQSUc&amp;hd=1</a><!-- m --></div>]]></body></post><post id="p234418" date="Posted: Tue Oct 18, 2011 8:32 pm "><author>Oneofthe8devilz</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">-==October 2011 Progress==-<br /><br />Thanks to <span style="font-weight: bold">Simulation|EMZ's</span> relentless technical support this month we successfully implemented a fully multiplayer compatible time of day system for the MCS gametype "DemonWars".
