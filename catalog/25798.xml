I have also optimized the mod (GTX 460)<br /><br />My Mod is powered by: <br /><br />"Sikkmod" v1.2 made by Sikkpin<br /><br />(<!-- e --><a href="mailto:sikkpin@hotmail.com">sikkpin@hotmail.com</a><!-- e -->)<br /><br />(BIG credits to Sikkpin for this amazing Doom 3 Modification!)<br /><br />Mod Installation:<br /><br />Simply extract the "VelociREAL Ultimate.rar" File into your Doom 3 main directory. Do NOT place it in the "base" folder. <br /><br />Example with Mod installed correct: <br /><br />C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Doom 3\VelociREAL Ultimate<br /><br />The mod can be loaded in two ways.<br /><br />1) is to load it through the "Mods" main menu item.<br /><br />2) is to use a custom shortcut to load it directly. You do this by creating a new shortcut for your "Doom3.exe". Right-click on it and select "Properties". Click on the "Shortcut" tab and in the "Target:" field put this:<br /><br />    +set fs_game VelociREAL Ultimate<br /><br />   after "...\Doom3.exe"<br /><br />Example: "C:\Games\Doom 3\Doom3.exe" +set fs_game VelociREAL Ultimate<br /><br /><br />But i recommend you use step 1 to load the Mod.<br /><br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">** Important Notice: Doom 3 must be version 1.3.1! **</span><br /><br /><br /><br />My Mod is hosted on RapidShare<br /><br /><br />DOWNLOAD the Mod here: <br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319221400/https://rapidshare.com/files/2230618365/VelociREAL%20Ultimate.rar" class="postlink">https://rapidshare.com/files/2230618365/VelociREAL%20Ultimate.rar</a><br /><br /><br />You can also visit my new Doom 3 website (Blog) here: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319221400/http://realsourceofevil.blogspot.se/" class="postlink">http://realsourceofevil.blogspot.se/</a><br /><br />My video of the Mod on YouTube can be seen here: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319221400/http://youtu.be/sJL6XZEEZKM?hd=1" class="postlink">http://youtu.be/sJL6XZEEZKM?hd=1</a><br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319221400im_/http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-WvWL29C5F4I/UB6XKcysnYI/AAAAAAAAA5o/kt0UCJi9da4/s300/Doom3%2B2012-08-05%2B14-08-56-81.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319221400im_/http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_nUdC47jU9k/UB6YBK4lETI/AAAAAAAAA68/gkxMic8ihVo/s300/Doom3%2B2012-08-05%2B12-52-08-72.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319221400im_/http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-o1qij8iSbe0/UB6X1H-x61I/AAAAAAAAA6w/wPt5SWVmaxA/s300/Doom3%2B2012-08-05%2B12-55-47-59.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319221400im_/http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-l-qB--NEv78/UB6XmWLvi8I/AAAAAAAAA6Y/thepQwKb2I0/s300/Doom3%2B2012-08-05%2B12-56-14-66.jpg" alt="Image" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p241838" date="Posted: Fri Aug 17, 2012 3:36 pm "><author>OttoS</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Hi VelociRaptorGTX,<br /><br />is your mod compatible with the D3-retail-version without any addons like RoE?<br />And can you please upload further, splitted download-packs?
