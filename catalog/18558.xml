<br />oh dont get me wrong, im not saying its bad or anything. or i dont make the mistakes but im just doing stuff like that to improve my own knowledge of mapping and help me remind of certain things, sometimes you see stuff in a map that makes you think "why not use it some other way"
<br /><br />and then actually use it as inspiration for your own work. not only that, i have looked at other people's maps ever since i started mapping. its an easy and fast way too learn, i look at what others have done, both pro and new mappers and try to learn something from it.
<br /><br />if i can pass some of this knowledge on to other people, and perhaps make others think about maps more, who knows what progress they could make, or even i by just looking at these maps, including my own.
<br /><br />i think its a very interesting topic in improving skills, its not just about simply laying some brushes(even though im sure we've all done it alot and enjoyed it <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> ) but also thinking more about the how and what to improve and perfect <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />i cant wait for a new generation of gaming on the doom 3 platform, the details the maps these days are astounding, looking back sometimes can be very usefull i think <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />so yes, its easy to look for a mistake in a level, but its harder to actually learn something from it <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p169554" date="Posted: Mon Feb 05, 2007 3:53 am "><author>Method</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Another thing you need to consider is time, in other words deadlines. People who work in the industry don't have time to "perfect" the map if there is such a thing. Missing a deadline, means slowing down the project, which will trigger publisher being irritated and stop paying you. Thus adding more work, which may lead to not being able complete it on time and being fired. In the worst case of course.
<br /><br />If you have some time on your hand, set yourself a deadline, say 2 months for a MP level. Build it and post it here, then see how many "mistakes" people will find.
<br /><br />Although looking at professional maps definitely helps and improves your skill.

<br /><br />it was just a coincidence i saw a small error in syncerror's map <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />i dont care about the errors, syncerror said he made the map 2 weeks after the CMP started, im just interested to know if he made it during work hours or just in free time. because it is a pretty tough map to make in such a small amount of time tho i have to say i was most impressed by another map, but i will save that for the voting <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />running around every map in the CMP has given me enough ideas to get going on my next map <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p169647" date="Posted: Mon Feb 05, 2007 4:46 pm "><author>SyncError</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">bolleh wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">syncerror said he made the map 2 weeks after the CMP started, im just interested to know if he made it during work hours or just in free time.</div>
