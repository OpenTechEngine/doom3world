Okay, let's see. This is me at Max's Kansas City in NYC. Another band, Blondie (not shown) in the audience:<br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081117022335im_/http://img406.imageshack.us/img406/6234/gizcolormbolusmaxskansall9.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />That's me in the middle:<br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081117022335im_/http://img406.imageshack.us/img406/7951/liveinbloomingtonfront4ye9.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />I'm the one who's not Johnny Cougar, me old labelmate:<br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081117022335im_/http://img404.imageshack.us/img404/5448/intrayqt5.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />On the left, with the ripped zipper:<br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081117022335im_/http://img176.imageshack.us/img176/5146/gizmoslib5112006tray3kp3.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />If you click on Pics on the site, you could see an updated family photo.<br /><br />The songs were originally played at high vol. Anyway, I got the idea because I kept bumping into fan sites for our band, but we just let 'em keep running. Just like a lot of bands are doing remakes of the songs and multiple labels have been selling a lot of bootlegs of some of our original recordings, but it's no skin off me. I just put this out there this month, and I'm already communicating with a lot of friends from other bands. Maybe not everybody's cup o' tea, but pretty great so far...</div>]]></body></post><post id="p195400" date="Posted: Fri Feb 22, 2008 4:33 am "><author>MBolus</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Dinky wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">The Gizmos?
