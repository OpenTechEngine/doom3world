I'm stuck here for 4 days trying to resolve this but without succes. Again i have no problem when plaing doom3 roe, doom3 and doom3 sikkmod 1.2 with realistic weapons only when I am on doom3 roe sikkmod 1.1!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p241956" date="Posted: Tue Aug 21, 2012 5:14 pm "><author>milospinkfloyd</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">c'mon guys I know someone knows the solution.

It didn't work. Game crashes to menu just as before.</div>]]></body></post></posts></thread></xml>
