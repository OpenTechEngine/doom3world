I can add a screenshot if desired. I tried the command "mirror" which reflects flawlessly but can't have layers added/blended (at least to my knowledge)<br /><br />Also, I want to add a fragment program (heathaze) that layers only on the<br />mirror stage (not the tiles stage). (which would give a warping effect to the reflection) is this possible<br />or am I dreaming? <br /><br />It it possible to make the mirror work perfectly on the tiles while having the heathaze.vfp ONLY affect the reflection (not the tiles themselves).<br /><br />2.

When on a wall however, it gets that<br />"Doom3 light stretch effect" - any quick fix to this?

The one produced by a fragment program and the one produced by mirrorrendermap.<br /><br />You can't do that. Each stage in a material shader can only make use of a single image.<br /><br />Second, fragment programs have a limited scope in id Tech 4 games. They can only manipulate image data stored in buffers like _currentrender, _scratch, ect...<br /><br />I believe mirrorrendermap stores it's image data in _scratch so you may have some luck passing that to the fragment program but expect buggy results. IMHO, the results of mirrorrendermap are garbage as is and heathaze was built with the intention of distorting the current render.<br /><br />Outside of the general purpose distortion effect that heathaze provides, there isn't much you can do in the way of image manipulation. You're pretty much limited to color, scale, shear, translational, and rotational adjustments.<br /><br />IMHO, you're much better off with an environment map. You won't get the 100% accurate realtime reflections you're after but they make use of the normal map stage so distortion will come naturally.<br /><br />As for subtle distortion, just add a very subtle cloud-like height map to your normal map stage. You can decrease the intensity in the material shader to the point where it has no visible effect on the tiles themselves but it will produce an impact on the reflection of your environment map.<br /><br />The projected lights in idTech 4 games suck. They should use cube maps but they don't. Instead they literally project an image along the z axis (up/down) and the result is as you describe, stretching on the walls.<br /><br />There is no fix short of using spotlights so you don't have to concern yourself with the sides.<br /><br />I'm going off on a tangent here but der_ton made a pretty cool demo based on his model viewer that demonstrates what the game would look like with proper cube map lights although I don't know if it's still available.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p188495" date="Posted: Sat Sep 15, 2007 11:28 am "><author>Zakyrus_theOmega</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks for the response!<br /><br />That sucks. The "mirror" itself works flawlessly (ofcourse overpowering all layer effects the stectile looks like it's made of Mercury), but the MirrorRenderMap IS totally gay. I probably piddle around with the MirrorRenderMap a little longer before I go with the env/map idea. (Damn, I can totally handle the realtime reflections too...) I can get the MirrorRenderMap to look very close (with the 'garbage' of other floors) I'll post back on this either method I try.<br /><br />Damn lack of cubemap lighting! Grrr! id taunts me with their Renderer SDK which is sealed in 1,000 vaults. So I'm pretty much stuck with "low-level" caustics - which is ok, because I'm sure I can fake the effect so that stretching will make the "caustic" look better. Where there's a will, there's a way.<br /><br />So... I'm pretty much screwed in both cases until id releases their Doom3 renderer code (ack! foiled again! RAGE needs to be released sooner.. hehe)<br /><br />EDIT:<br />Oh, and one more thing... If I want to add falloff to all lights in Doom3 by changing the .mtr files.<br /><br />Let's say I do this:<br />lights/biground1<br />{<br />	lightFalloffImage	makeintensity( lights/squarelight1a.tga )<br />	{<br />		forceHighQuality<br />		map	lights/biground1.tga<br />		colored<br />		zeroClamp<br />	}<br />}<br /><br />which is better, that or this:<br /><br />lights/biground1<br />{<br />	{<br />		forceHighQuality<br />		map	lights/biground1.tga<br />		colored<br />		zeroClamp<br />	}<br />	{<br />		forceHighQuality<br />		map	lights/biground1.tga<br />		colored<br />                scale 1.5, 1.5<br />		zeroClamp<br />                //then add some alpha intensity to make the second layer more transparent...<br />                //if so what do I put here?<br />	}<br />}<br /><br />Which method would be better to add "Faked" and increased falloff.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p188529" date="Posted: Sun Sep 16, 2007 6:05 am "><author>rich_is_bored</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I'm not sure I'm following you.

The one produced by a fragment program and the one produced by mirrorrendermap.<br /><br />You can't do that. Each stage in a material shader can only make use of a single image.<br /><br />Second, fragment programs have a limited scope in id Tech 4 games. They can only manipulate image data stored in buffers like _currentrender, _scratch, ect...<br /><br />I believe mirrorrendermap stores it's image data in _scratch so you may have some luck passing that to the fragment program but expect buggy results. IMHO, the results of mirrorrendermap are garbage as is and heathaze was built with the intention of distorting the current render.<br /><br />Outside of the general purpose distortion effect that heathaze provides, there isn't much you can do in the way of image manipulation. You're pretty much limited to color, scale, shear, translational, and rotational adjustments.<br /><br />IMHO, you're much better off with an environment map. You won't get the 100% accurate realtime reflections you're after but they make use of the normal map stage so distortion will come naturally.<br /><br />As for subtle distortion, just add a very subtle cloud-like height map to your normal map stage. You can decrease the intensity in the material shader to the point where it has no visible effect on the tiles themselves but it will produce an impact on the reflection of your environment map.<br /><br />The projected lights in idTech 4 games suck.

Resizing small textures to a larger size may make the image dimensions larger, but it has to use (at best) advanced bicubic operations to try to "stretch" the detail out.  In the end, because the image has to be the same size anyway, it'll get scaled down or it won't tile properly across faces.&#13;<br /><br />So, basically it can't be done with any sort of appreciable quality.

In a lucky scenario retexturing one asset takes 20 minutes: This means drawing a diffusemap from scratch, creating a specular map, a localmap and an extra heightmap pass for detail and creating the material decl for it. Realizing that there are over 3200 different texture assets  alone in Doom3 (models, geometry, weapons, monsters etc..etc..) makes this a project involving atleast 1066 hours and that's if y'er really lucky.&#13;<br /><br />There are some retexturing projects going on at this moment for Quake 1, Unreal 1 and such other oldies, some have amazingly good results. I'm not expecting any kind of retexturing project for Doom3, considering that it's much more fun to make new assets for a new TC or Mod. Basically you're out of luck here. &#13;<br /><br />You might be able to pull of some batch of photoshop work to sharpen things up a bit, but the quality won't be 'amazing'. Better to look into things like the parallax mapping mod if you want to improve depth and such in the Doom3 textures.&#13;<br /><br />Hope that helps.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p181610" date="Posted: Thu Jun 21, 2007 5:38 pm "><author>Bittoman</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Kristus wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Wisp you magic wand you got when you attended Hogwarts over it 5 times while chanting the magic phrase.

If I want to add falloff to all lights in Doom3 by changing the .mtr files.<br /><br />Let's say I do this:<br />lights/biground1<br />{<br />	lightFalloffImage	makeintensity( lights/squarelight1a.tga )<br />	{<br />		forceHighQuality<br />		map	lights/biground1.tga<br />		colored<br />		zeroClamp<br />	}<br />}<br /><br />which is better, that or this:<br /><br />lights/biground1<br />{<br />	{<br />		forceHighQuality<br />		map	lights/biground1.tga<br />		colored<br />		zeroClamp<br />	}<br />	{<br />		forceHighQuality<br />		map	lights/biground1.tga<br />		colored<br />                scale 1.5, 1.5<br />		zeroClamp<br />                //then add some alpha intensity to make the second layer more transparent...<br />                //if so what do I put here?<br />	}<br />}<br /><br />Which method would be better to add "Faked" and increased falloff.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p188529" date="Posted: Sun Sep 16, 2007 6:05 am "><author>rich_is_bored</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I'm not sure I'm following you.

Let's say, I want to duplicate the stage of light, then scale the light 1.5 times larger, then in the duplicated light stage -- increase the amount of translucency (so the light has a more intense part, then fades to a lesser intensity/greater radii)</div>]]></body></post><post id="p188538" date="Posted: Sun Sep 16, 2007 10:21 am "><author>rich_is_bored</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Overbright lights perhaps?<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071030132834/http://www.katsbits.com/htm/tutorials/quake_4_editing_tips.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1134662510&amp;archive=&amp;start_from=&amp;ucat=13&amp;">http://www.katsbits.com/htm/tutorials/q ... =&amp;ucat=13&amp;</a><!-- m --></div>]]></body></post><post id="p188540" date="Posted: Sun Sep 16, 2007 10:31 am "><author>Zakyrus_theOmega</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">rich_is_bored wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Overbright lights perhaps?<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071030132834/http://www.katsbits.com/htm/tutorials/quake_4_editing_tips.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1134662510&amp;archive=&amp;start_from=&amp;ucat=13&amp;">http://www.katsbits.com/htm/tutorials/q ... =&amp;ucat=13&amp;</a><!-- m --></div><br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20071030132834im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /><br />Thank you so much this is EXACTLY what I am talking about.

Simply reduced the mirrorRenderMap resolution down to 128 rather than 1024.<br />This is a somewhat "cheapened" and "less conventional" method (that is, using low-res pixelation to my advantage), but hey, most artists have to know that faking an effect is sometimes almost as good as doing it another (and more complicated) method. There is a vast difference between spending 10 years doing one effect and comprimising when it is "good enough".</div>]]></body></post></posts></thread></xml>
