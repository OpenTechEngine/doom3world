This one does <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319220812im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> you might get some weird effects with custom shaders like sikkpins (like one user posted a screenie of) that happens because the shaders for the GLSL backend was made using Doom3's R200 shaders as a reference (ATI who would have guessed that hehe) and they are very generic so not really suited for sikkmod. But try executing Doom3.exe directly and then enable them <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319220812im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> they look pretty good on the unmodified shaders from Doom3.<br />Im no GLSL shader guru so i cant write sikkmod compatible interaction shaders for it but if someone can then im pretty sure it will look allright.<br /><br />Hope that shed some light on it <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319220812im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p242259" date="Posted: Sun Sep 02, 2012 1:04 pm "><author>reckless</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319220812/http://www.bild.me/bild.php?file=5606378shot00006.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319220812im_/http://s1.bild.me/bilder/160512/thumb_5606378shot00006.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319220812/http://www.bild.me/bild.php?file=5565787shot00007.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319220812im_/http://s1.bild.me/bilder/160512/thumb_5565787shot00007.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319220812/http://www.bild.me/bild.php?file=4416760shot00009.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319220812im_/http://s1.bild.me/bilder/160512/thumb_4416760shot00009.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br /><br />Shots say more than words heres the GLSL renderer without sikkmod <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319220812im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p242260" date="Posted: Sun Sep 02, 2012 1:24 pm "><author>doomrama</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">The problem is still there even if I use r_useGLSL 1, still 1 fps.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p242261" date="Posted: Sun Sep 02, 2012 2:35 pm "><author>Tron</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I'm not sure I fully understand, for those of us who are a bit stupid and slightly drunk (mmm, port) what benefits does this installer give over using Sikkmod normally?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p242262" date="Posted: Sun Sep 02, 2012 2:36 pm "><author>reckless</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Darn :S guess i will have to go ugly on the code.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p242263" date="Posted: Sun Sep 02, 2012 2:40 pm "><author>reckless</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Nothing besides a few fixes and an easy way to use the mod <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319220812im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br />My included engine should also be faster but as you probably noticed AMD/ATI users have some trouble with it.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p242267" date="Posted: Sun Sep 02, 2012 4:22 pm "><author>doomrama</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I ran your mod with the latest build at 640x480 then it ran at around 15 fps.

This one does <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319220837im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> you might get some weird effects with custom shaders like sikkpins (like one user posted a screenie of) that happens because the shaders for the GLSL backend was made using Doom3's R200 shaders as a reference (ATI who would have guessed that hehe) and they are very generic so not really suited for sikkmod. But try executing Doom3.exe directly and then enable them <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319220837im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> they look pretty good on the unmodified shaders from Doom3.<br />Im no GLSL shader guru so i cant write sikkmod compatible interaction shaders for it but if someone can then im pretty sure it will look allright.<br /><br />Hope that shed some light on it <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319220837im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p242259" date="Posted: Sun Sep 02, 2012 1:04 pm "><author>reckless</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319220837/http://www.bild.me/bild.php?file=5606378shot00006.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319220837im_/http://s1.bild.me/bilder/160512/thumb_5606378shot00006.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319220837/http://www.bild.me/bild.php?file=5565787shot00007.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319220837im_/http://s1.bild.me/bilder/160512/thumb_5565787shot00007.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319220837/http://www.bild.me/bild.php?file=4416760shot00009.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319220837im_/http://s1.bild.me/bilder/160512/thumb_4416760shot00009.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br /><br />Shots say more than words heres the GLSL renderer without sikkmod <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319220837im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p242260" date="Posted: Sun Sep 02, 2012 1:24 pm "><author>doomrama</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">The problem is still there even if I use r_useGLSL 1, still 1 fps.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p242261" date="Posted: Sun Sep 02, 2012 2:35 pm "><author>Tron</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I'm not sure I fully understand, for those of us who are a bit stupid and slightly drunk (mmm, port) what benefits does this installer give over using Sikkmod normally?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p242262" date="Posted: Sun Sep 02, 2012 2:36 pm "><author>reckless</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Darn :S guess i will have to go ugly on the code.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p242263" date="Posted: Sun Sep 02, 2012 2:40 pm "><author>reckless</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Nothing besides a few fixes and an easy way to use the mod <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319220837im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br />My included engine should also be faster but as you probably noticed AMD/ATI users have some trouble with it.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p242267" date="Posted: Sun Sep 02, 2012 4:22 pm "><author>doomrama</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I ran your mod with the latest build at 640x480 then it ran at around 15 fps.

Its even worse on ATI with down to 1 FPS drops reportedly.<br /><br />One thing that comes to mind is that the FPS counter code from doom3 was replaced by a more precise version from mh, old one did not obey the fact that doom3 can newer exceed 60 fps so it might have shown some fubar values.<br /><br />i reverted a few things codewise because i found them to behave incorrectly like the scalable gui code (its whats causing the 640x480 display on first run).<br />I found timedemo to incorrectly measure FPS i allways get 60 fps on two 560 gtx but it drops to about 40 when loading a map. <br />My best advise is to disregard the timedemo as a test as the results dont agree. Also the timedemo seems to disregard sikkmods effects and wulfens highres textures which might explain why you get more FPS in the timedemo. <br /><br />Latest compile seems to run quite a bit more stable <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319220317im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> and i fixed a few whoopsies with the GLSL renderer.<br />ill upload it tonight.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p243030" date="Posted: Thu Oct 18, 2012 2:53 pm "><author>reckless</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">The doom3 exes on my site can all be used though not everything there is for doom3 <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319220317im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />The mh-doom3 can also be used though it currently has a weird glitch that causes models to look weirdly shaded.

Unfortunatly the changes needed are pretty huge so this might take some time.<br /><br />So be vary when enabling stuff from sikkmod and try to find a good balance where its playable while still looking better <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319220317im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> might take some experimenting to get a good outcome but sikkpin has riddled the mod with options to toy with so its definatly possible to get a good result.<br /><br />Major FPS monsters are SSAO / SSIL and ambient lights. SSAO also has a rather annoying bug in outdoors scenes due to it using a hack to get the depth textures causing <br />the skybox to have dark outlines (also noticable on certain effects). SSIL works ok but it does take a few fps off.<br />Ambient light looks fine but also takes a few fps off.<br /><br />Sikk was working on a modified engine some time back that would fix a lot of the hacks by adding the missing features to the engine but its been a bit quiet lately so im not sure if he got everything working yet. It also added the option to use custom parralax shaders to textures that dont bug out on them.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p243192" date="Posted: Mon Oct 22, 2012 3:40 am "><author>filot</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Hi reckless, I tried your lastest compile DOOM3.exe,but it still about 18 fps, then I tried to replace DOOM3HD's exe with this compiled version, before replace it has 55-60fps,after replace it only 15-20fps in same setting, may bug still in this version <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319220317im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319220317im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p243205" date="Posted: Mon Oct 22, 2012 5:55 am "><author>reckless</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">are the 15-20 fps with sikkmod ?.<br />asking because thats about what i get with it when i have everything on <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319220317im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />if not then the bug may still be in effect though as far as i know it only affects ATI users if you get that low fps with a nvidia card then ouch cause on my nvidia 560 i get double that.

This one does <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319220837im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> you might get some weird effects with custom shaders like sikkpins (like one user posted a screenie of) that happens because the shaders for the GLSL backend was made using Doom3's R200 shaders as a reference (ATI who would have guessed that hehe) and they are very generic so not really suited for sikkmod.

Unfortunatly the changes needed are pretty huge so this might take some time.<br /><br />So be vary when enabling stuff from sikkmod and try to find a good balance where its playable while still looking better <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319220317im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> might take some experimenting to get a good outcome but sikkpin has riddled the mod with options to toy with so its definatly possible to get a good result.<br /><br />Major FPS monsters are SSAO / SSIL and ambient lights. SSAO also has a rather annoying bug in outdoors scenes due to it using a hack to get the depth textures causing <br />the skybox to have dark outlines (also noticable on certain effects). SSIL works ok but it does take a few fps off.<br />Ambient light looks fine but also takes a few fps off.<br /><br />Sikk was working on a modified engine some time back that would fix a lot of the hacks by adding the missing features to the engine but its been a bit quiet lately so im not sure if he got everything working yet. It also added the option to use custom parralax shaders to textures that dont bug out on them.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p243192" date="Posted: Mon Oct 22, 2012 3:40 am "><author>filot</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Hi reckless, I tried your lastest compile DOOM3.exe,but it still about 18 fps, then I tried to replace DOOM3HD's exe with this compiled version, before replace it has 55-60fps,after replace it only 15-20fps in same setting, may bug still in this version <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319220317im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319220317im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p243205" date="Posted: Mon Oct 22, 2012 5:55 am "><author>reckless</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">are the 15-20 fps with sikkmod ?.<br />asking because thats about what i get with it when i have everything on <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319220317im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />if not then the bug may still be in effect though as far as i know it only affects ATI users if you get that low fps with a nvidia card then ouch cause on my nvidia 560 i get double that.
