<br /><br />I just wondered if anyone here has an easy way to export a common format from maya for reimport into max. Something like 3ds or some such. Unfortunately (being an utter noob to maya) I have not yet figured out how to do this. Any help and assistance is appreciated.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p123090" date="Posted: Sat Nov 26, 2005 6:41 pm "><author>Democritus</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Persistent me found a solution to this.
<br /><br />There is an OBJexporter that comes with the TOOLKIT and that you need to activate in the plugins manager (windows, plugin manager). Then you can export to OBJ which works just fine.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p161743" date="Posted: Wed Nov 08, 2006 6:48 pm "><author>d-fens</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I know the newer versions of Max will import .fbx's.
