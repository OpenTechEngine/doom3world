A very promising mod by team Grid Lock being developed for several years now. Sadly enough the team has been having difficulties finishing the damn thing. Now it isnt very much a level problem, there's tons of great done level content. It's more the things that make them fun to play like gameplay mechanics, items, weapons, monsters (AI) etc... Alot of wich we have but, also alot unfinished.  We realized we where to ambitious and decided to divide the mod into episodes.  Now i'm sure those episodes will be released sooner or later. The mod is not dead! But it IS idling atm. I'm sure once the whole team can pick up that good old motivation again things will get out eventually. there's so much been done that may and shall not be wasted! <br /><br />If you still are awaiting good old recall to hell. you can drop a support line in the forums <br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081118183123/http://recalltohell.d3files.com/phpbb/">http://recalltohell.d3files.com/phpbb/</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><br />Second up is chapter 2 for my dbz2 level. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Blood</span><br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081118183123im_/http://img96.imageshack.us/img96/8351/teasezr2.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />You can still download and enjoy chapter one if you didn't already! <br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081118183123/http://doom3.filefront.com/file/Doomed_by_zizz_2;85466">http://doom3.filefront.com/file/Doomed_by_zizz_2;85466</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Last time a got some great help tweaking my level from playtesters.
