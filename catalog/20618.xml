NOW! here is the problem. <br /><br />when loading the game, the intro video starts up and about a minute into it, the screen goes blank. He can still hear sound, but theres no video. Theres also no error message, just the "windows has encountered a problem woiuld you like to report" crap when he closes it from task manager. <br /><br />at first he had old video drivers, but then and after updating them what he saw of the intro video looked better and ran smoother, however he is still crashing about 30 seconds after loading the game. ive been looking all over forums and googled and everything, but i cant find anyone with this sepcific problem, and frankly, im stumped. <br /><br />any ideas??? please help!!!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p189667" date="Posted: Fri Oct 05, 2007 12:19 am "><author>Final_Light</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Well sounds like a video card issue to me.<br />But i guess it could be a number of things, Firewall, installation, mods, Doom 3 settings ?<br />I say try re-installing Doom 3, updates etc. See what happens.</div>]]></body></post></posts></thread></xml>
