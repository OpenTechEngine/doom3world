<br /><br />Basically Ive got this scene set up, alot of polys but they're all needed. I click render, it quits a few minutes later saying 'error: memory exception thrown'.
<br /><br />Okidoki i thinks to myself, i check out the help thing and the only bit of advice it really offered was to change the width and height of the tiles when rendering. But this can only be done through batch rendering via the command prompt.
<br /><br />So i set up a little .bat file to render it, the actual code works fine as I tested it first, no errors there it outputs everything just right. The help Doc told me that the flag '-cont' would force the render to continue, error or no errors, and that the flags '-tw' and '-th' followed by a number would define smaller tile boxes. However whenever I add these I just get a message telling me they're invalid. I've tried numerous ways of typing them, followed the help file religiously but still to no avail.
<br /><br />At the very least it'd be nice if the '-cont' flag worked so it'd get done eventually, but no! And im struggling to find a reason for why not it just says 'invalid flag'
<br /><br />I'm running Maya 6 if that makes any difference. If anyone knows what im doing wrong you'd be helping me severly. Alternatively if anyone knows a way of forcing maya to render (i really dont care how long it takes I just need it done) that'd also be mighty handy!
