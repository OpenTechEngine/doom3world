It seems like every time they release a new tech it rips the industry out of their graphics comfort zone and forces everyone to improve.

It will be unlocked from the start. I mean doom3 not being able to be uncapped from 60 fps (62.5) had a lot of people complaining and it took me a while to understand. With Quake4, they added in a patch a command to uncap it up to 125, then I could see why people wanted it and id has definitely learned from that.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p202186" date="Posted: Wed Jul 16, 2008 9:07 pm "><author>qwertz123</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">"history repeats itself" great song on the Natural Born Killers soundtrack.<br /><br />anyway: bioshock comes to mind.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p202188" date="Posted: Wed Jul 16, 2008 11:25 pm "><author>Brain Trepaning</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">"History repeats itself" made me think of a classic punk album from way back when.

Also, both Q4 and to a lesser extent D3 suffered from this. When you see Acti doing CoD4 commercials and whatnot you kinda wonder if they had anyone looking after QW before the console versions hit.<br /><br />Back to Rage. This trailer sucks as a trailer but the contents look great. The environments look alot more varied than what we saw last year and we saw more people on screen. I agree with those that said the animations of the two guys with gogles and hoods looked amazingly real. I'm still bummed about the baked lighting especially since that's not something you can turn off if you have a high-end PC.<br /><br />Overall, if last year I was more interested in the game than in the graphics, this trailer gives me hope that the graphics will at least hold up during play (and look amazing in static shots and whenever dynamic light/shadows don't come into the picture).<br /><br />Also, queue the absolutely predictable id bashing at the EA announcement. id (or better yet EA since it's their job) should start a fightthesmear.com site with the following:<br /><br />n00b says: OMGOMG this is going to have DRM up the arse.<br />Truth: No and like previous id titles any disk-check is being removed on the first patch.<br /><br />n00b says: You can forget about a Steam release.<br />Truth: HL2, Episode One, Orange Box, Sin Episode 1 are published by EA and are on Steam. id is on Steam already as an independent vendor rather than being mixed in with the Activision listing.<br /><br />n00b says: id is such a whore for selling out.<br />Truth: EA already published two id games and if id is a whore then so is Valve, CryTek, DICE, and a truckload of other companies you believe to walk on water.<br /><br />n00b says: oh crap they're going to rush this stuff like the Battlefield series.<br />Truth: id has already said after the EA announcement.

I.e. there's still a real-time contribution. And unlike Rage, in general, it also has no shadow baking (except for the odd tree shadows here and there and ambient occlusion). Even this means you get double-shadows. Go into Ark, first objective to the left of the generator when facing the strogg base. There are a couple of trees with their shadows baked in. Now go into into third person and see the double-shadows. Here it's not even a big deal because the baked tree shadow is sufficiently soft that it's nearly ambient occlusion but this is seen very clearly in last year's Rage trailer when the buggy is fully enveloped by the canyon's shadow. Even in this year's trailer you can notice the different shadow techniques when the buggy aproaches the fort.<br /><br />It's not just day/night cycles. It's any time a moving shadow caster aproaches, or is envoloped by, a static occluder. In fact, QW actually works better with day/night cycles than Rage ever will because it doesn't have any (major) shadow baking. The terrain shadows are dynamic, same as the players and vehicles and they use the same technique so there's no visual difference. You can change the atmosphere (i.e. Sun position) on any QW map and it will still look good unless you actively go look for the baked tree shadows that are now facing the wrong way. In Rage, if the canyon's shadow is baked there's no need to look for the artefact.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p202062" date="Posted: Tue Jul 15, 2008 6:31 pm "><author>CrimsonHead</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Quake 3 did'nt have <span style="font-style: italic">real</span> fog it was hacked in, Doom was'nt <span style="font-style: italic">real</span> 3d, who cares if it was'nt the <span style="font-style: italic">proper</span> way It still looked good and I was wowed by it at the time.

Publishing deals vary quite a bit from case to case; publishers can pay the developers tons of money and then get nearly all the proceeds from sales, but it's common that publishers "invest" in the project in terms of cash, to ensure that the developers will be able to hire new people when needed, and to cover some percentage of development costs. The publisher will then also handle marketing and testing of the game, and perhaps take something like 90% of the proceeds.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p202066" date="Posted: Tue Jul 15, 2008 7:44 pm "><author>qwertz123</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Gena wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081116080954/http://www.gamespot.com/video/939980/6193863/rage-interview-2" class="postlink">John Carmack, David DeMartini, and Tim Willits discuss the newly announced partnership between Id Software and EA.</a> <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081116080954im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div><br /><br />"yup, wolfenstein comes back to us real soon also" (5:03)<br /><br />did john actually say that? my reading comprehension is by far better than to have hear it <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081116080954im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p202072" date="Posted: Tue Jul 15, 2008 8:20 pm "><author>pbmax</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">crap, this 4 part interview ain't working for me:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081116080954/http://kotaku.com/5025229/carmack-talks-from-idea-to-mac-gaming-and-ps3-programming">http://kotaku.com/5025229/carmack-talks ... rogramming</a><!-- m --></div>]]></body></post><post id="p202074" date="Posted: Tue Jul 15, 2008 8:28 pm "><author>Krollspell</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">not working for me either... what a shame <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081116080954im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> Is there anywhere else to find this?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p202077" date="Posted: Tue Jul 15, 2008 8:46 pm "><author>zeh</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Great video, thanks a lot Gena.<br /><br />An interesting thing is they mention they've talked with Valve when shopping around and asking questions about EA's partnerships.

It varies alot from the normal situation, to big name independents like id that are able to sle-funfd their games. But the usual deal is one where the developer signs over all the IP rights to the franchise in question, where as id(or 3D Realms, Epic, Remedy and Valve as some of the few other examples) is able to fully self-fund their games and there by get to keep the IP rights, including the publishing rights to sequels(Although for various reasons, the might <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-style: italic">CHOOSE</span></span></span> to do multi-game deals).<br /><br />For some more info on this check out these articles:<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081116125347/http://dukenukem.typepad.com/game_matters/2004/01/contract_deal_p.html" class="postlink">http://dukenukem.typepad.com/game_matters/2004/01/contract_deal_p.html</a><br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081116125347/http://dukenukem.typepad.com/game_matters/2003/12/royalties_and_a.html" class="postlink">http://dukenukem.typepad.com/game_matters/2003/12/royalties_and_a.html</a><br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081116125347/http://www.igda.org/articles/smiller_commandments.php" class="postlink">http://www.igda.org/articles/smiller_commandments.php</a><br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081116125347/http://www.igda.org/biz/contract_walkthrough.php" class="postlink">http://www.igda.org/biz/contract_walkthrough.php</a>(as it says you must be registered to read these).<br /><br />In addition to that there are two full contracts I could find online, one even with industry expert commentary:<br /><br />You can see the Call Of Duty: Finest Hour contract with expert commentary here: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081116125347/http://gamasutra.com/features/20070112/spark_01.shtml" class="postlink">http://gamasutra.com/features/20070112/spark_01.shtml</a><br /><br />Note this is a more standard contract with publisher IP ownership and all, but a bit on the omnious side of things. However in this case not even a Valve could have gotten IP ownership, since it was an already established brand that Acitivision already owned.<br /><br />The publishing contract between 3D Realms and GOD Games for Max Payne can be found here: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081116125347/http://www.secinfo.com/d12atd.4FA7p.c.htm" class="postlink">http://www.secinfo.com/d12atd.4FA7p.c.htm</a>.<br /><br />These two contracts show how sharp the differences with regard to IP ownership wording can be, compare the wording found <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081116125347/http://gamasutra.com/features/20070112/spark_02.shtml" class="postlink">here</a> with the following text from the Max Payne agreement:<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">9.1 Developer shall be the owner of all intellectual property rights in the<br />Game and the deliverables related thereto created or developed by Developer,    <br />including without limitation, all copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade        <br />secrets, and other proprietary rights.

Gimme, gimme, gimme!<br /><br />pbmax, I don't think JC means it will be locked at 30fps. Check out last year's IGN video interview with John and Matt where JC says Rage is a 60 Hz game (60fps) because they want the game to be smooth for the racing parts and how a licensee can make their game looks 3 times better than Rage if they aim for 30 Hz instead, like DOOM 3 did. It's a performance threshold, not any engine limitation. JC goes on to say that you can have 3 times the detail if you aim for 30fps instead of 60fps game because to get 60fps on Rage they had to undershoot quite a bit.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">CrimsonHead wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Rage looks good, and I mean GOOD, the only thing that might be a downer for me about the lighting method is I'm wondering does that mean we'll see the return of super-lengthy level compiling times again?</div><br /><br />Compiling the megatexture for ETQW's terrains takes quite a bit of time.

It's not uncommon to hear the same type of people usually bragging about their 200 GB HD or something along those lines and then you look at their PC and see that they only use around 60-70 gigs of it. Why spend the extra money on something they probably won't ever even fully utilize? They want those big numbers, something to brag about.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p202145" date="Posted: Wed Jul 16, 2008 1:14 pm "><author>iceheart</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">CrimsonHead wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">... bragging about their 200 GB HD or something along those lines and then you look at their PC and see that they only use around 60-70 gigs of it...</div><br /><br />Out of context, but <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081116125347im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081116125347im_/http://82.182.97.10/hd.png" alt="Image" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p202146" date="Posted: Wed Jul 16, 2008 1:22 pm "><author>asmodeus</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">BloodRayne wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Perhaps you should take a look at investing money in a good monitor, because most people won't discern the difference between 30 and 60 fps.</div><br /><br />They will during extended play periods as the lower Hz causes eye strain.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p202159" date="Posted: Wed Jul 16, 2008 4:00 pm "><author>Kristus</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Mordenkainen wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Compiling the megatexture for ETQW's terrains takes quite a bit of time.

That doesn't mean that your game will be streamed to your monitor with a maximum of 30 FPS. It just means animations and the engine itself are likely to run at a Tic rate of 30, big difference there. It also doesn't mean your monitor will run at 30 Hz. (most monitors can't even run on 30 Hz. and most common LCD monitors are capped at 60 Hz. in any case.)<br /><br />Eye strain usually means that one needs to: <br />- Use a higher refresh rate for your monitor (e.g. I use a refresh rate of 120 at 1280x1024 on my LCD monitor)<br />- Adjust brightness, contrast, gamma and sharpness of the monitor, as well as new calibration (for e.g. the moire effect).<br />- Buy a better monitor.<br /><br />It does not mean 'Games should have higher FPS'. FPS is not the same as the refresh rate of your monitor, nor does it mean 'chuggy gameplay' when you're playing at 30 FPS. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081116125347im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />A.f.a.i.k. Game play below 30 fps on a good set-up only very seldomly causes eye strain, and only with individuals that are proned to it.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p202168" date="Posted: Wed Jul 16, 2008 5:40 pm "><author>TelMarine</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">id would never lock a game's FPS at 30, that is extremely low.
