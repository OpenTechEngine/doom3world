We need a programmer to script a special spectator camera for Doom3. 150$USD is offered RIGHT NOW to the first coder that shows us it can work. By the way sorry for any language mistake we might do here, we originally speak French.<br /><br />OBSERVATION:<br /><br />We need a spectator camera that can follow Player1, just like the one Quake3 is doing. However, in Quake3 and Doom3 the mouselook function (which is the one that allow to look around with the mouse) is desactivated.<br /><br />WORK DESCRIPTION:<br /><br />We need that camera position to always follow the Player1 position (so movement keys are not active for the spectator), while keeping mouselook active. The spectator camera must also be set at range=0 from the Player1 position.<br /><br />So in other words, we want to simulate a first-person point of view with a 3rd-person spectator camera. The result would be that you see roughly in thru this spectator view ALMOST the same thing as the Player1 view is seeing (but you see third-person models instead of first-person models), and even if you cannot control its movements, you can look at Player1's back or sides with the mouse (mouselook).<br /><br />This is quite a simple script, but we can't manage to do it by ourselves. Hope it does not require the full source to achieve this, else we would have to go back to Quake3 engine, which is a bad thing.<br /><br /><br />For any extra info, please contact Mike at:<br />e-mail: <!-- e --><a href="mailto:exotyktechnologies@gmail.com">exotyktechnologies@gmail.com</a><!-- e --><br />MSN: <!-- e --><a href="mailto:nuganx@hotmail.com">nuganx@hotmail.com</a><!-- e --><br /><br />Best regards,<br /><br /><br />Michael Dionne<br />Exotyk Technologies</div>]]></body></post><post id="p210015" date="Posted: Sat Jan 17, 2009 11:20 am "><author>iceheart</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Please only post in one place.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p210021" date="Posted: Sat Jan 17, 2009 3:28 pm "><author>exotyktechnologies</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">No problem, sorry for this  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225102128im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p209999" date="Posted: Sat Jan 17, 2009 4:13 am "><author>exotyktechnologies</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Greetings community,<br /><br />We are a small video game developper established in Quebec, Canada.
