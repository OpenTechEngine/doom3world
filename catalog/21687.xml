This hacked savegame also has the "Homebrew" stuff in it.  You load this savegame onto your SD card and run TLP.  Once the game is loaded, you perform an action that causes a particular error...  the hacked savegame has code in it (a very lengthy name for your horse) that will cause the game to error with a "stack smash."  This error being thrown is used to start the Homebrew installation.  Once you have Homebrew installed, it'll show up as a channel on your Wii and you can get rid of the hacked savegame.  <br /><br />You'll have to do this again if you want to upgrade Homebrew or your Wii updates with a firmware that breaks Homebrew, but other than that, Homebrew will show up just like any other Wii Channel and can be deleted the normal way, if needed.<br /><br />Homebrew allows you to run emulators for older nintendo platforms or even execute other code and games... I believe I read something about simple java games working with homebrew now.<br /><br />Of course, the important thing is the fact that we'll be able to play Quake 1 on the Wii with the WiiMote and all its glory!<br /><br />That's the basic run-down.
