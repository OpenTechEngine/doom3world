<br /><br />I don't think we have the right user base to offer more 3D application boards - eventually we'll be able to mature towards this, but it'll take years.
<br /><br />To maintain a forum section you need about 100 active users and a handful of totally dedicated ones being in there literally 24/7.
<br /><br />When I look through the registered users emails, I find 50 something triple A persons who visit us for occasional advanced problems, but that's about it.
<br /><br />The majority are still gamers-gone-modders and about 5% maximum of all users are what I consider active community people.
<br /><br />Anyhow, D3W is fun and it's my goal to evolve it further, especially beyond the lifecycle of the Doom3 engine (beginning 2008 imho).
<br /><br />In the end 3D applications will become more and more important in the computing world. There is a wealth of knowlegde one need to know when dealing in 3D and about two thirds of that knowlegde are generalized paradigms of thinking - the rest is application specific.
<br /><br />To illustrate this point further with a simple example:
<br />Once you got the concept of UV mapping, you'll be able to transfer that knowledge to any given applicaiton, may it be a game, a 3D modelling application or a rendering code base.
<br /><br />That's also the reason why I don't try to compete in the fansite for game.x market. D3W is meant as a starting point for people advancing in 3D and the Doom3 engine is the nucleus which is getting talented people drawn towards all things 3D.
<br /><br />BTW - I consider AI a 3D application as well. It's "just" entities trying to calculate their way trough a computed environment made up of volumes.
<br /><br />This might be a bit visionary, but the concept of 3D has just started.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p111369" date="Posted: Sun Sep 04, 2005 9:45 am "><author>doomkid3000</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">are there any discount prices for ZBrush <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205105409im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p111370" date="Posted: Sun Sep 04, 2005 9:47 am "><author>1eyed</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Yeah, I added a few to many applications to my list, but wings, milkshape and XSI mod tool are good beginner tools, maybe even more so than gmax or maya ple.

<br /><br />I don't think we have the right user base to offer more 3D application boards - eventually we'll be able to mature towards this, but it'll take years.
<br /><br />To maintain a forum section you need about 100 active users and a handful of totally dedicated ones being in there literally 24/7.
<br /><br />When I look through the registered users emails, I find 50 something triple A persons who visit us for occasional advanced problems, but that's about it.

<br /><br />I welcome a Zbrush forum, it's just that the technical side of zbrush is quite easy to learn, the artistic side is something that requires more traditional art / sculpting teaching, which don't transfer well to a mod forum.
<br /><br />I hope you evolve D3W further. D3W has a very good foundation. In a few years I hope it eventually will grow into a great general mod making community, maybe even indie game community. 
<br /><br />With some nice support from the industry, such as talk to pros events, competitions with sponsored prices, etc <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Hopefully a new cgtalk.com for mods...  modtalk.com <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p111400" date="Posted: Sun Sep 04, 2005 4:13 pm "><author>doomkid3000</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">yeah i hope i do suceed, and i usualy do learn from all sorts of sites, 3dtotal, 3dkingdom.org,and lots more, i was wandering if there was a discount price on zbrush, since i cant import jack in the demo, but i'll play around some more with this a bit more <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p111432" date="Posted: Sun Sep 04, 2005 7:58 pm "><author>Sparky</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Hey, nifty! A ZBrush board. 
<br />I only picked up the program a couple days ago, but I'll contribute what I can. If I learn anything useful, I'll make sure to post it here.

I definately don't want to post it in all of the 3d app forums. <br /><br />Even though there are a few tutorial links in the doom 3 modelling &amp; animation forum, I only found them becuase I wrote this post and wanted to make sure I didn't miss something. Maybe I'm not the only one that did that?<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">BNA wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">That's also the reason why I don't try to compete in the fansite for game.x market. D3W is meant as a starting point for people advancing in 3D and the Doom3 engine is the nucleus which is getting talented people drawn towards all things 3D. </div>
<br /><br />Fanboys can go to...  The reason I want a general 3d forum, is to give both beginners, (and veterans) a better way to share knowledge, no matter what application they choose to work or develop for. As it is now, I feel that alot of the resources are unavailible.
<br /><br />just some of my random thoughts <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p111469" date="Posted: Mon Sep 05, 2005 4:58 am "><author>doomkid3000</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">agreed <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  good point</div>]]></body></post></posts></thread></xml>
