The work was mainly particle effects and work that goes along with it, but there are also a lot of other touches. I've add a lot of lighting to the weapon effects for projectiles and impacts and removed shadows from the lighting effects so they aren't nearly as CPU intensive. New decals and model textures have been added as well. A readme is included that details everything.

Version 1.2 has been released. </span><br /><br />It includes new particles for barrels and air tanks based off of the grenade and rocket launcher frag effects. Debris physics have been modified and there is new debris smoke trails. The Bloodstone also has some creepy additions to it.<br /><br />And there are maps included to demonstrate the new effects for the barrels and such. Map names are :barrels, burningbarrels, airtanks, burningairtanks, and barrels_slime (ROE only)<br /><br />Download links have been updated. I have yet to upload the new version at filefront and Moddb is awaiting authorization. GameBanana and 2shared work.<br /><br />And a video, since words don't do it justice.<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319221856/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_REItnTTwIg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319221856im_/http://i24.photobucket.com/albums/c42/Phrozenbot/Phrozo%20Weapon%20Mod/preview2.png" alt="Image" /></a><br /><br />I plan a new release of 1.3, but I've hit some snags. Firstly, most of what I wanted to accomplish is pretty much included in what I have released so far, but some small changes I would like to do are limited to my lack of techy skills. Here is a list of ideas.<br /><br />*Chainsaw strike light effect. I was thinking that having a quick muzzleflash light effect happen when the chainsaw strikes metal would be cool. <br /><br />*Particle smoke of the BFG and Plasma Cells when reloading. I have something workable for the BFG, but the view models for the weapons are rendering over my particles, especially the Plasmagun even with sort set to "nearest". I tried Post process but that makes them hardly visible. Not sure if there is anyway around this.<br /><br />*Implementing parm7 based conditions for the Plasmagun vent textures similar to the Soulcube. I would like to have it either nodraw when out of ammo, or maybe dim it. Maybe even have it brighten up for a second when you reload. These are still ideas I don't know how to get to work quite yet, although I have been looking.<br /><br />*Static particles for muzzleflashes. If I could somehow have a secondary muzzle particle system that is bound to the muzzle/barrel joint like the grabber does in ROE, I could have better effects that lasted longer for some of the weapons without them moving away when you run or walk. The only reason I have gotten away with it for some effects is that I have some of the stages life cycle set to extremely quick times, really only for 1 or 2 frames. <br /><br />*Sparks. Aimed particles exiting the barrels simply aren't the best way to have great looking sparks effects. At certain angles it is like looking down the side of a piece of paper; you can't see it. My way of getting around this was to extend the time in the aimed settings, but that just makes them too long at certain angles. A new spark and tracer system is needed to make these effects look better sadly. Even with deform tube, tracers suck.<br /><br />*Specific BFG particle explosion types for each charge level, such as a moderate explosion at a singular charge with an epic effect when quad charged.<br /><br />*New effect with the soulcubes vampire damage that heals you. Everytime it heals you, I thought it might be cool if red mist spawned on you or something. Nothing to obscure vision but enough to be noticeable. Doomtrinity's scripting may come in handy for this.<br /><br />*Just a small sfx and energy blast wave that happens when you activate the bloodstone. And being the perfectionist I am, the throbing sfx that I added is only synced when the heart is fully charged and has tachycardia (beats unusually fast). There would have to be a new particle effect for when it beats in a normal healthy range.<br /><br />*Blood particles when the player is hit. I enabled "bleed" in the player.def file and wasn't able to get anything to work.<br /><br />*Grabber barrel fire effect. When you grab barrels or airtanks with it, they catch on fire and smoke. I changed it to use my new barrelfire particle, but it insists on using the old version. What gives? This was in the grabber def, so I don't know what I missed. MMMMM!!!!<br /><br />*And a lot of other small things that I forgot.<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">*Monster effects are out of the question for now. I think they are fairly fine already, but the amount of work and def files... I don't even want to think about it right now.</span><br /><br />Alright, so maybe I am being a bit dreamy, but if anyone can/wants to help on any of this, let me know. I will certainly put it to good use in future releases. I wish I could do this all by myself instead of bugging you all, but hey... can't hurt to ask.<br /><br /><br />[edit] I may do some new effects for mods like Denton's mod that support different material types, such as when impacting dirt, stone, metal, glass, etc. <br /><br />Cheers. Enjoy. Oh and btw, this mod is is compatible with sikkmod since I know a lot of you play with it. Just put it in the sikkmod folder and it should work without changing the game play. I am not sure about other mods, but it definitely won't work with a mod like denton's mod. You would have to do some manual editing.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p233055" date="Posted: Sun Sep 04, 2011 11:23 pm "><author>David_020</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Very nice work.

I had a hard time imagining what I really wanted to do with it so I kind of just pieced something together and that was the best I could come up with at the time. I'll revisit a few things to make them better in the future though.<br /><br />and btw, there is a big mofo particle texture I accidentally left in the pak that I could have sworn I deleted before I even uploaded the test version but I missed it and I got sloppy for rushing things a bit I guess. The texture (textures/particles/phrozo/normal_gel.tga) is about 5.5 mbs alone (it is a big animation strip I was testing with), and is not used at all so the mod is really about 1.5 mbs or so.</div>]]></body></post></posts></thread></xml>
