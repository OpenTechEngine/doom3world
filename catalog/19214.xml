<br /><br />It doesn't seem to like singleplayer much =( I'll get random crashes and freezes during the singleplayer game. Loading maps is particularly bad, but opening doors and starting cinematic sequences is also problematic. I'll get a maximum of 10minutes playtime before a crash happens.
<br /><br />v1.3 was fine, solid and stable. Nothing has changed on my computer between patches so I'm very confident it's not my software or hardware.
<br /><br />Is anyone else having this problem?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p175883" date="Posted: Sat Apr 14, 2007 1:03 am "><author>visciom</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Yea I've been having crashes as well in singleplayer.
