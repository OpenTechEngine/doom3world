In an interview on GamesIndustry.biz, Bethesda European's managing director Sean Brennan confirms that Splash Damage's latest project will be unveiled at next month's E3 show in Los Angeles. Sean also confirms a few other tidbits (yes, it's a first person shooter) and goes as far as calling the thing a "genre-breaker" (in a good way, mind you). Check out the interview for all of Sean's comments and stay tuned for much more to come in early June!</div><br /><br />Can't wait.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p214449" date="Posted: Mon May 11, 2009 8:23 pm "><author>Hostyle</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Enemy Territory 2 - Wolfenstein Doom Wars.
