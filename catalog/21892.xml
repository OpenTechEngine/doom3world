Currently the team consists of three full time members, Berserk working on code, Mo working on weapon models/animations and myself working on just about everything else. Currently our SVN sits at around 4,000 files, from map models and weapons, to textures and art. That's an amazing resource for a part time mapper who does maps for a hobby to come in and help out if he wishes, because the media is there, and what isn't, the team will make for them. And there's the problem. Even though OverDose is moving along, it's moving along at a slower pace than we would like. Thus, Team Blur is currently looking for anybody to come in and help us with media. We currently don't have any completed maps for OverDose, only SDK maps. We currently don't have any player models for OverDose, only concept art. We currently don't have the team we would like, and we would like anybody who feels they can contribute to the project to get in touch with us.<br /><br />Here is a re-cap of some basic gameplay features OverDose has:<br /><br />· Team/Class based multiplayer pits the struggling Confederate Marine Corps against the invading alien Marauder's in a classic RtCW style team based game.<br /><br />· Fight over huge terrain and take the battle to the Marauders or defend against the evil Earth CMC forces in smaller classic corridor shooter maps and vice versa.<br /><br />· Weapons are customisable, with scopes, laser sights, silencers etc, with changing attributes to balance the gameplay.<br /><br />· Weapons for the CMC include the deadly Flamer, the awesome RPG, and the deadly Sniper Rifle among others.<br /><br />· Weapons for the MDR include the deadly Spiker, the flesh ripping Shredder and the high precision Railgun among others.<br /><br />· With teams highly balanced but A-symmetrical, choosing the right class is a life or death situation for you and your team.<br /><br />· Compete online with persistent game rankings, built in VOIP support, clan logo and team names, plus many more.<br /><br />· Customise the appearance of your class, with different skin tone selections and faces.<br /><br />· Using a highly customized engine, OverDose not only delivers "Per Pixel Lighting", but also "Soft Shadows", "MD5Mesh/MD5Anim" models for weapons/players, a highly tweakable "terrain and foliage system" and more kick ass stuff than you can shake a chicken eating a shoe at.<br /><br />· Plus much, much more...<br /><br />As you can see, not only is OverDose on the right lines to delivering a kick ass FREE game to everybody, we also believe we have an amazing community already built upon our last project, Quake II Evolved. To steal a quote from the awesome Cliff Blezinsky himself, we want OverDose to be "Bigger, better and more bad ass" than anybody is expecting. But to do that, we need help, we need team members.<br /><br />Anybody who feels they have what it takes to work with us on this awesome project please get in touch with us via either e-mail or the community forums (Links below). As a bonus, here are a few screenshots of the project in progress.<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203023324/http://www.teamblurgames.com/overdose/media/weapons/handsfinal_large.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203023324im_/http://www.teamblurgames.com/overdose/media/weapons/handsfinal_small.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203023324/http://www.teamblurgames.com/overdose/media/weapons/knife_2_large.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203023324im_/http://www.teamblurgames.com/overdose/media/weapons/knife_2_small.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203023324/http://www.teamblurgames.com/overdose/media/weapons/o37_2_large.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203023324im_/http://www.teamblurgames.com/overdose/media/weapons/o37_2_small.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203023324/http://www.teamblurgames.com/overdose/media/conceptart/grunt2_large.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203023324im_/http://www.teamblurgames.com/overdose/media/conceptart/grunt2_small.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br /><br />Thanks, and hope to hear from you all soon.<br /><br />o'dium<br />Lead Designer for Team Blur.<br />email: <a href="mailto:odiummsn@hotmail.com">odiummsn@hotmail.com</a><br /><br />OverDose Website:<br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203023324/http://www.quake2evolved.com/overdose" class="postlink">http://www.quake2evolved.com/overdose</a><br /><br />OverDose Community Forums:<br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203023324/http://www.quake2evolved.com/blurforum/" class="postlink">http://www.quake2evolved.com/blurforum/</a></div>]]></body></post><post id="p203851" date="Posted: Sun Aug 17, 2008 4:20 pm "><author>=NoMercy=</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">The links don't work for me.

You can download a higher resolution version of the demo by visiting the media section of the website, or you can view a You Tube version of the demo directly below:<br /><br />YouTube (Low Quality - Stream): <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203023324/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zLSZV9DKBw" class="postlink">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zLSZV9DKBw</a><br />ModDB (Medium Quality - Stream): <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203023324/http://www.moddb.com/mods/overdose/videos" class="postlink">http://www.moddb.com/mods/overdose/videos</a><br />FileFront (High Quality - Download): <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203023324/http://files.filefront.com/OverDose+Technology+Demozip/;11553293;/fileinfo.html" class="postlink">http://files.filefront.com/OverDose+Technology+Demozip/;11553293;/fileinfo.html</a><br /><br />Couple of new technology shots for you. First up is a nicer look at terrain blending on terrain models, followed by support for curves and patches.<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203023324/http://www.teamblurgames.com/overdose/media/miscscreenshots/terrainblending2_large.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203023324im_/http://www.teamblurgames.com/overdose/media/miscscreenshots/terrainblending2_small.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203023324/http://www.teamblurgames.com/overdose/media/miscscreenshots/curves_large.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203023324im_/http://www.teamblurgames.com/overdose/media/miscscreenshots/curves_small.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br /><br />Some more shots. First up we have of course the shadow mapping. Our lighting engine is per pixel, like Doom 3's, however unlike Doom 3, which uses hard edged stencil shadows, we use shadow maps. This means quality wise, we have a much much nicer effect, because the shadows are smoother, plus alpha tested surfaces like grates, foliage etc can cast shadows now, which is impossible with stencil shadowing. At the moment, we haven't added any shadow filtering options (Such as how blurred or smooth the shadow is) so the shadows are shown here in raw form. Secondly, a screenshot showing our .md5mesh and .md5anim support. Now, I know you cant exactly tell an animation from a screen shot, so don't worry... It will all be revealed soon enough... <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203023324im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203023324/http://www.teamblurgames.com/overdose/media/miscscreenshots/shadowmaps_large.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203023324im_/http://www.teamblurgames.com/overdose/media/miscscreenshots/shadowmaps_small.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203023324/http://www.teamblurgames.com/overdose/media/miscscreenshots/md5_large.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203023324im_/http://www.teamblurgames.com/overdose/media/miscscreenshots/md5_small.jpg" alt="Image" /></a></div>]]></body></post><post id="p204058" date="Posted: Thu Aug 21, 2008 5:35 pm "><author>6th Venom</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Cool stuffs, will your engine be available for users as a SDK? when?

First up we have zFeather particles. As you can see in the screenshot, particles that would usually clip into the floor now fade out at the edges making for a smoother transition into surfaces. Secondly, we have a shot based on our Light Editor, which ships built into OverDose so people can easily edit lights ingame. Lastly, we have our dedicated tools for development on OverDose (Please note that ODMap is WIP).<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203023324/http://www.teamblurgames.com/overdose/media/miscscreenshots/zfeather_large.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203023324im_/http://www.teamblurgames.com/overdose/media/miscscreenshots/zfeather_small.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203023324/http://www.teamblurgames.com/overdose/media/miscscreenshots/lighteditor_large.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203023324im_/http://www.teamblurgames.com/overdose/media/miscscreenshots/lighteditor_small.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203023324/http://www.teamblurgames.com/overdose/media/miscscreenshots/tools_large.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203023324im_/http://www.teamblurgames.com/overdose/media/miscscreenshots/tools_small.jpg" alt="Image" /></a></div>]]></body></post><post id="p204070" date="Posted: Fri Aug 22, 2008 12:53 am "><author>Kristus</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Impressive to say the least.

First up is a nicer look at terrain blending on terrain models, followed by support for curves and patches.<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203021731/http://www.teamblurgames.com/overdose/media/miscscreenshots/terrainblending2_large.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203021731im_/http://www.teamblurgames.com/overdose/media/miscscreenshots/terrainblending2_small.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203021731/http://www.teamblurgames.com/overdose/media/miscscreenshots/curves_large.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203021731im_/http://www.teamblurgames.com/overdose/media/miscscreenshots/curves_small.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br /><br />Some more shots. First up we have of course the shadow mapping. Our lighting engine is per pixel, like Doom 3's, however unlike Doom 3, which uses hard edged stencil shadows, we use shadow maps. This means quality wise, we have a much much nicer effect, because the shadows are smoother, plus alpha tested surfaces like grates, foliage etc can cast shadows now, which is impossible with stencil shadowing. At the moment, we haven't added any shadow filtering options (Such as how blurred or smooth the shadow is) so the shadows are shown here in raw form. Secondly, a screenshot showing our .md5mesh and .md5anim support. Now, I know you cant exactly tell an animation from a screen shot, so don't worry... It will all be revealed soon enough... <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203021731im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203021731/http://www.teamblurgames.com/overdose/media/miscscreenshots/shadowmaps_large.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203021731im_/http://www.teamblurgames.com/overdose/media/miscscreenshots/shadowmaps_small.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203021731/http://www.teamblurgames.com/overdose/media/miscscreenshots/md5_large.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203021731im_/http://www.teamblurgames.com/overdose/media/miscscreenshots/md5_small.jpg" alt="Image" /></a></div>]]></body></post><post id="p204058" date="Posted: Thu Aug 21, 2008 5:35 pm "><author>6th Venom</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Cool stuffs, will your engine be available for users as a SDK? when?

First up we have zFeather particles. As you can see in the screenshot, particles that would usually clip into the floor now fade out at the edges making for a smoother transition into surfaces. Secondly, we have a shot based on our Light Editor, which ships built into OverDose so people can easily edit lights ingame. Lastly, we have our dedicated tools for development on OverDose (Please note that ODMap is WIP).<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203021731/http://www.teamblurgames.com/overdose/media/miscscreenshots/zfeather_large.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203021731im_/http://www.teamblurgames.com/overdose/media/miscscreenshots/zfeather_small.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203021731/http://www.teamblurgames.com/overdose/media/miscscreenshots/lighteditor_large.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203021731im_/http://www.teamblurgames.com/overdose/media/miscscreenshots/lighteditor_small.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203021731/http://www.teamblurgames.com/overdose/media/miscscreenshots/tools_large.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203021731im_/http://www.teamblurgames.com/overdose/media/miscscreenshots/tools_small.jpg" alt="Image" /></a></div>]]></body></post><post id="p204070" date="Posted: Fri Aug 22, 2008 12:53 am "><author>Kristus</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Impressive to say the least.
