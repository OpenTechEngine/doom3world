<br /><br />The detailed description of the mod is really making me want to help, I enjoyed the challenge of working from postage stamp sized specifications.
<br /><br />I've got it!!!
<br /><br />It's the Doom3 "Guess the theme of my Mod" mod!
<br /><br />How many goes do I get?
<br />What do I win if I guess right?
<br /><br />He's my guesses:
<br />So it's set on earth is it?
<br />Is that this planet earch? today? 1945? 2045?
<br />Is it a sci-fi mod with killer robots?
<br />Is it a horror based mod with zombies running/limping around killing everyone?
<br />Post nuclear war? with ruined cities?
<br />Constantine (unofficial) movie tie-in?
<br /><br />Are you going to announce the winner ( person with the closest guess ) at the end of the month ?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p81665" date="Posted: Fri Mar 11, 2005 12:52 pm "><author>whatthe</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">In response to Dante_Uk i answer that it is not a guessing game. Let me tell you a bit about the mod
<br /><br />-It is set right after doom 3 when the doom guy is saved, he is taken back to earth and somehow one of the mosnsters have snuck aboard and when they get to earth, the monster contacts hell and hell arives on earth and attacks
<br /><br />-It will be mostly sci-fi/action (duh) with a slight horror theme. when the horror theme is included, the monsters will not continually spawn behind you. Instead, i will find ways to keep some parts suspenceful, creepy and eery
<br /><br />-It will not have anything to do with the movie.  I will hope to get big ruined cities in the mod. And as usual, higher ranked officiers will keep some secret buiness to them selves that will be later known to the player later in the game.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p81680" date="Posted: Fri Mar 11, 2005 4:13 pm "><author>breakerfall</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">And you say it shares no resemblence to Doom3: HOE other than the name? Heh.
<br /><br />Again, you really haven't got much ground to start a mod. You haven't got anything to lure in people to help. Other than a stupidly simple idea and a name, you have nothing (or at least fail to show anything). If you're serious about starting a mod, more enthusiasm needs to be shown. Ideas, storylines (not just a 3 pointer), possibly some simple concept art... <span style="font-style: italic">anything</span>.
<br /><br />I just don't see you getting much help with this mod.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p81742" date="Posted: Fri Mar 11, 2005 9:37 pm "><author>SnoopJeDi</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Nice to see you're being received here well instead of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225104539/http://cdoom.d3files.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=426" class="postlink"><span style="font-style: italic">our</span> forums</a>

<br />i give some of the starting scene.
<br /><br />As two marines helped the doom guy on the ship, one of the the marines is a it further back, taking into his mike. "The place is empty" the marine says "There's nothing here but rotting corpses and unnatural growth" The person on the other line responds "Good work marine, i hope to get you're full report on what when on at 2300 hours, now get back on the ship" The marines glances around "I think i heard something sir" The marine takes a step forward. "Well ignore it, we need to get back to Earth alrealy" The Marine takes another glance around. "Yes sir, tranmission out" The marine walk acroos the platform and onto the ship.

<br /><br />The detailed description of the mod is really making me want to help, I enjoyed the challenge of working from postage stamp sized specifications.
<br /><br />I've got it!!!
<br /><br />It's the Doom3 "Guess the theme of my Mod" mod!
<br /><br />How many goes do I get?
<br />What do I win if I guess right?
<br /><br />He's my guesses:
<br />So it's set on earth is it?
<br />Is that this planet earch? today? 1945? 2045?
<br />Is it a sci-fi mod with killer robots?
<br />Is it a horror based mod with zombies running/limping around killing everyone?
<br />Post nuclear war? with ruined cities?
<br />Constantine (unofficial) movie tie-in?
<br /><br />Are you going to announce the winner ( person with the closest guess ) at the end of the month ?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p81665" date="Posted: Fri Mar 11, 2005 12:52 pm "><author>whatthe</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">In response to Dante_Uk i answer that it is not a guessing game. Let me tell you a bit about the mod
<br /><br />-It is set right after doom 3 when the doom guy is saved, he is taken back to earth and somehow one of the mosnsters have snuck aboard and when they get to earth, the monster contacts hell and hell arives on earth and attacks
<br /><br />-It will be mostly sci-fi/action (duh) with a slight horror theme. when the horror theme is included, the monsters will not continually spawn behind you. Instead, i will find ways to keep some parts suspenceful, creepy and eery
<br /><br />-It will not have anything to do with the movie.  I will hope to get big ruined cities in the mod. And as usual, higher ranked officiers will keep some secret buiness to them selves that will be later known to the player later in the game.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p81680" date="Posted: Fri Mar 11, 2005 4:13 pm "><author>breakerfall</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">And you say it shares no resemblence to Doom3: HOE other than the name?

<br /><br />Again, you really haven't got much ground to start a mod. You haven't got anything to lure in people to help. Other than a stupidly simple idea and a name, you have nothing (or at least fail to show anything). If you're serious about starting a mod, more enthusiasm needs to be shown.

<br />You can't honestly expect guys who have spent months/years learning how to map/model/code to just join up with you, when you have nothing but a dream in your head. 
<br />Thousands of people would love to make mods, but only a small percentage actually take the time to learn what's involved in mapping etc. Then, an even smaller percentage will go on to actually finish a mod project.
<br /><br />If you want guys to take you seriously, then at least spend a few weeks learning to use the doom editor and make some maps to show people what you have in mind. Then you'll have something tangible to show that you are serious, and you'll have a better idea of what can and can't be achieved with the doom engine.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p82330" date="Posted: Tue Mar 15, 2005 4:44 am "><author>whatthe</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081120233903im_/http://img7.exs.cx/img7/115/chainsaw3al.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />very basic chainsaw

Fix the links, it's annoying to have to copy and paste to see the images.  The chainsaw and chaingun you showed have vastly different art styles.  Did you make them both yourself?

What I was implying is, you are ripping off people's artwork and claiming it for your own.  Didn't you see "The chainsaw and chaingun you showed have vastly different art styles. Did you make them both yourself?"
<br /><br />What you are attempting to do is lower than low.  If you take someone else's work, cite them.  You didn't even bother to be sneaky about it.  It took 2 seconds in a Google image search to find your images.
<br /><br />The chainsaw is from Unreal Tournament.  And it looks like you ganked that image from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081120233903/http://www.unreal-info.net/ut/weapons.html" class="postlink">here</a>.  The first chaingun is from some guy's ray tracing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081120233903/http://home.elka.pw.edu.pl/~jsobiers/traces/" class="postlink">gallery</a>.  And that last image is a chaingun from the Holy Wars mod for Half-life.  It it seems you took that picture from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081120233903/http://www.planethalflife.com/holywars/manual/weapons.htm" class="postlink">here</a>.
<br /><br />I mean, those are two completely different chain guns.  They don't look alike at all.  The chainsaw is from Unreal Tournament, a game that many people on these boards have probably played.  The other glaring fact is, Doom 3 already sports those weapons.  There is really no need to remake them, they look excellent as is in the game.
<br /><br />Next time, don't try to pawn things off as your own.  What were you going to do when someone joined the mod and asked to see the model?  All you have is a picture.  You don't even have the models for those weapons.
<br /><br />Just treat this as a lesson and move on.  Try to fool around with the tools provided to you and see what aspect of making games you enjoy most.  After that see about joining an existing mod to gain some experience.
<br /><br />Anyway, those are my suggestions.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p82363" date="Posted: Tue Mar 15, 2005 8:20 am "><author>whatthe</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">i dont know anything about modding and there just there to show you some stuff i might put in the mod, i might show some om MY concept drawings next time.

<br /><br />All of what you have listed here so far only goes against what you are trying to do because you havnt thought about what it is exactly that you ARE trying to do.
<br /><br />The reason people believed that those images were you trying to say you did them yourself was due to the nature in which they were posted and the context that the thread had lead through too.
<br /><br />Before anyone will come join your modification, you will need to do the following things:
<br /><br />1) Make youself a website
<br />2) Create a design document detailing what the mod is about and what sets it out from all the countless other mods out there
<br />3) Show the work you have done yourself to get others interested
<br /><br />Those three key things will show to the public that you are serious about the task you are trying to acomplish.
<br /><br />You should not have made a thread requesting help without thinking out more of what you actually want to acomplish with the project.
<br /><br />The reason everyone is ridiculing you is because the way it seems that each time someone says something constructive, you get defensive, then answer back with something even more rediculous than what has already been stated previously.
<br /><br />Do some organisation work of your own, show what you are able to bring to the table for all to see, then with that, people will come and help.
<br /><br />Go to the "mod wanted" forum and read up in a few of those threads to see more about how things are done around here.
<br /><br />Finally, as its an open forum, you cant dictate to people what they say or think or if they read this thread. By the topic alone you are drawing people in - then everyone reads through what has been said already, laughs - then posts their thoughts. If you want control over your own forum go and get a free one , like from bearkey or somewhere.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p82648" date="Posted: Thu Mar 17, 2005 4:19 am "><author>whatthe</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">i cant make a website because i dont know how, dont tell me the find out. im nearly finished my script and a few of my own concept pictures</div>]]></body></post><post id="p82649" date="Posted: Thu Mar 17, 2005 4:21 am "><author>whatthe</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">i dont know how to make my own website, dont tell me to learn. i am going full blast on my script and im doing some basic concepts</div>]]></body></post><post id="p82650" date="Posted: Thu Mar 17, 2005 4:21 am "><author>whatthe</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">accidental two posts</div>]]></body></post><post id="p82655" date="Posted: Thu Mar 17, 2005 5:15 am "><author>metal</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225105027im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /> Humorous... <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225105027im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> ....very humorous</div>]]></body></post><post id="p82657" date="Posted: Thu Mar 17, 2005 5:49 am "><author>whatthe</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">what??</div>]]></body></post><post id="p82659" date="Posted: Thu Mar 17, 2005 7:15 am "><author>dojoteef</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">YOU STOLE MY IDEA!

<br /><br />YOU want to lead a mod team, I think we all agree on that. To lead a mod-team you need to know what everyone of your team is able to do. You have to deligate work to everyone and synchronize everything. How are you going to do that if you don't even know how to make a website, distribute files, make a map, make a model, code something, and many other things.
<br /><br />Your problem seems to be, that you think you can do this in a "movie-director style". You have the idea, others do the work. But it won't work that way.
<br /><br />Either you begin to learn things (first learn how to write HTML, there are enough tutorials on the net for that, then learn at least making a map for D3, it does not need to be a good map, but you should at least have a basic understanding of the engine, and then there is much more for you to learn). If you are to lazy for that, or you are simply to dumb to learn such things (no offense, it's your call if you are to dumb or just to lazy), then leading a mod-team is NOT MEANT FOR YOU!!!
<br /><br />So... learn something or quit the mod-idea, only 2 options (actually there are 2 more: do both, learning and quitting, or do something different, like writing a book).
<br /><br />Hope you understand now why noone takes you serious here. You lack the basic knowledge that is needed for any position on a mod-team (and the team-leader needs the most knowledge tbh).</div>]]></body></post><post id="p82749" date="Posted: Thu Mar 17, 2005 9:59 pm "><author>T0r1t0</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">im nearly 15 years old.</div>

Heck, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225104041/http://www.advsys.net/ken/" class="postlink">Ken Silverman</a> started work on the Build Engine while he was only 17.  That's the engine that was used for Duke Nukem 3D, Blood, and a number of other games.   Heck he released the game <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225104041/http://www.advsys.net/ken/klab.htm" class="postlink">Ken's Labyrinth</a>, a Wolfenstein 3D clone published by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225104041/http://www.epicgames.com/" class="postlink">Epic</a>, when he was only 17.
<br /><br />So it is possible to do things when you are young.  You just have to have dedication and the will to learn on your own.  You can't expect to get spoonfed the skills required to make a game or mod.  You have to actively strive for it.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p82760" date="Posted: Thu Mar 17, 2005 10:53 pm "><author>whatthe</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">stuff this, i quit</div>]]></body></post><post id="p82772" date="Posted: Thu Mar 17, 2005 11:53 pm "><author>Gazado</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">well thats one way out if it.

<br />Is it a sci-fi mod with killer robots?
<br />Is it a horror based mod with zombies running/limping around killing everyone?

Let me tell you a bit about the mod
<br /><br />-It is set right after doom 3 when the doom guy is saved, he is taken back to earth and somehow one of the mosnsters have snuck aboard and when they get to earth, the monster contacts hell and hell arives on earth and attacks
<br /><br />-It will be mostly sci-fi/action (duh) with a slight horror theme. when the horror theme is included, the monsters will not continually spawn behind you. Instead, i will find ways to keep some parts suspenceful, creepy and eery
<br /><br />-It will not have anything to do with the movie.  I will hope to get big ruined cities in the mod. And as usual, higher ranked officiers will keep some secret buiness to them selves that will be later known to the player later in the game.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p81680" date="Posted: Fri Mar 11, 2005 4:13 pm "><author>breakerfall</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">And you say it shares no resemblence to Doom3: HOE other than the name?

<br />You can't honestly expect guys who have spent months/years learning how to map/model/code to just join up with you, when you have nothing but a dream in your head. 
<br />Thousands of people would love to make mods, but only a small percentage actually take the time to learn what's involved in mapping etc. Then, an even smaller percentage will go on to actually finish a mod project.
<br /><br />If you want guys to take you seriously, then at least spend a few weeks learning to use the doom editor and make some maps to show people what you have in mind. Then you'll have something tangible to show that you are serious, and you'll have a better idea of what can and can't be achieved with the doom engine.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p82330" date="Posted: Tue Mar 15, 2005 4:44 am "><author>whatthe</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081120233903im_/http://img7.exs.cx/img7/115/chainsaw3al.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />very basic chainsaw

What I was implying is, you are ripping off people's artwork and claiming it for your own.  Didn't you see "The chainsaw and chaingun you showed have vastly different art styles. Did you make them both yourself?"
<br /><br />What you are attempting to do is lower than low.  If you take someone else's work, cite them.  You didn't even bother to be sneaky about it.  It took 2 seconds in a Google image search to find your images.
<br /><br />The chainsaw is from Unreal Tournament.  And it looks like you ganked that image from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081120233903/http://www.unreal-info.net/ut/weapons.html" class="postlink">here</a>.  The first chaingun is from some guy's ray tracing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081120233903/http://home.elka.pw.edu.pl/~jsobiers/traces/" class="postlink">gallery</a>.  And that last image is a chaingun from the Holy Wars mod for Half-life.  It it seems you took that picture from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081120233903/http://www.planethalflife.com/holywars/manual/weapons.htm" class="postlink">here</a>.
<br /><br />I mean, those are two completely different chain guns.  They don't look alike at all.  The chainsaw is from Unreal Tournament, a game that many people on these boards have probably played.  The other glaring fact is, Doom 3 already sports those weapons.  There is really no need to remake them, they look excellent as is in the game.
<br /><br />Next time, don't try to pawn things off as your own.  What were you going to do when someone joined the mod and asked to see the model?  All you have is a picture.  You don't even have the models for those weapons.
<br /><br />Just treat this as a lesson and move on.  Try to fool around with the tools provided to you and see what aspect of making games you enjoy most.  After that see about joining an existing mod to gain some experience.
<br /><br />Anyway, those are my suggestions.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p82363" date="Posted: Tue Mar 15, 2005 8:20 am "><author>whatthe</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">i dont know anything about modding and there just there to show you some stuff i might put in the mod, i might show some om MY concept drawings next time.

<br /><br />All of what you have listed here so far only goes against what you are trying to do because you havnt thought about what it is exactly that you ARE trying to do.
<br /><br />The reason people believed that those images were you trying to say you did them yourself was due to the nature in which they were posted and the context that the thread had lead through too.
<br /><br />Before anyone will come join your modification, you will need to do the following things:
<br /><br />1) Make youself a website
<br />2) Create a design document detailing what the mod is about and what sets it out from all the countless other mods out there
<br />3) Show the work you have done yourself to get others interested
<br /><br />Those three key things will show to the public that you are serious about the task you are trying to acomplish.
<br /><br />You should not have made a thread requesting help without thinking out more of what you actually want to acomplish with the project.
<br /><br />The reason everyone is ridiculing you is because the way it seems that each time someone says something constructive, you get defensive, then answer back with something even more rediculous than what has already been stated previously.
<br /><br />Do some organisation work of your own, show what you are able to bring to the table for all to see, then with that, people will come and help.
<br /><br />Go to the "mod wanted" forum and read up in a few of those threads to see more about how things are done around here.
<br /><br />Finally, as its an open forum, you cant dictate to people what they say or think or if they read this thread. By the topic alone you are drawing people in - then everyone reads through what has been said already, laughs - then posts their thoughts. If you want control over your own forum go and get a free one , like from bearkey or somewhere.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p82648" date="Posted: Thu Mar 17, 2005 4:19 am "><author>whatthe</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">i cant make a website because i dont know how, dont tell me the find out. im nearly finished my script and a few of my own concept pictures</div>]]></body></post><post id="p82649" date="Posted: Thu Mar 17, 2005 4:21 am "><author>whatthe</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">i dont know how to make my own website, dont tell me to learn. i am going full blast on my script and im doing some basic concepts</div>]]></body></post><post id="p82650" date="Posted: Thu Mar 17, 2005 4:21 am "><author>whatthe</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">accidental two posts</div>]]></body></post><post id="p82655" date="Posted: Thu Mar 17, 2005 5:15 am "><author>metal</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225105027im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /> Humorous... <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225105027im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> ....very humorous</div>]]></body></post><post id="p82657" date="Posted: Thu Mar 17, 2005 5:49 am "><author>whatthe</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">what??</div>]]></body></post><post id="p82659" date="Posted: Thu Mar 17, 2005 7:15 am "><author>dojoteef</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">YOU STOLE MY IDEA!

<br /><br />YOU want to lead a mod team, I think we all agree on that. To lead a mod-team you need to know what everyone of your team is able to do. You have to deligate work to everyone and synchronize everything. How are you going to do that if you don't even know how to make a website, distribute files, make a map, make a model, code something, and many other things.
<br /><br />Your problem seems to be, that you think you can do this in a "movie-director style". You have the idea, others do the work. But it won't work that way.
<br /><br />Either you begin to learn things (first learn how to write HTML, there are enough tutorials on the net for that, then learn at least making a map for D3, it does not need to be a good map, but you should at least have a basic understanding of the engine, and then there is much more for you to learn). If you are to lazy for that, or you are simply to dumb to learn such things (no offense, it's your call if you are to dumb or just to lazy), then leading a mod-team is NOT MEANT FOR YOU!!!
<br /><br />So... learn something or quit the mod-idea, only 2 options (actually there are 2 more: do both, learning and quitting, or do something different, like writing a book).
<br /><br />Hope you understand now why noone takes you serious here. You lack the basic knowledge that is needed for any position on a mod-team (and the team-leader needs the most knowledge tbh).</div>]]></body></post><post id="p82749" date="Posted: Thu Mar 17, 2005 9:59 pm "><author>T0r1t0</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">im nearly 15 years old.</div>

Heck, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225104041/http://www.advsys.net/ken/" class="postlink">Ken Silverman</a> started work on the Build Engine while he was only 17.  That's the engine that was used for Duke Nukem 3D, Blood, and a number of other games.   Heck he released the game <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225104041/http://www.advsys.net/ken/klab.htm" class="postlink">Ken's Labyrinth</a>, a Wolfenstein 3D clone published by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225104041/http://www.epicgames.com/" class="postlink">Epic</a>, when he was only 17.
<br /><br />So it is possible to do things when you are young.  You just have to have dedication and the will to learn on your own.  You can't expect to get spoonfed the skills required to make a game or mod.  You have to actively strive for it.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p82760" date="Posted: Thu Mar 17, 2005 10:53 pm "><author>whatthe</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">stuff this, i quit</div>]]></body></post><post id="p82772" date="Posted: Thu Mar 17, 2005 11:53 pm "><author>Gazado</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">well thats one way out if it.

<br /><br />Yeah really dude, literally I am 15 years old been doing multimedia (means lots of different things) for nearly 6 years here. I'm doing Animation for d3jedi....
<br /><br />Just relax, take a few steps back from creating a full fletched mod. Do many many projects on your own, understand your skills and what your best at, where you would fit best in a development team....
<br /><br />Either way... how much expeirence do you have developing these kinds of things?
<br /><br /><br />*just realized most of my post is about myself*.... anyway... lets get to the real subject... my whole life I spent in front of my computer... if I was near death and saw my life flash before my eyes, I would see me grow from 2 years old to 15 years old on my computer chair in front of my computer.... man.... I need a real life..... *Laughs and giggles with the rest of the forum*
<br /><br />Seriously though.. practice on your own for a while...
