<br /><br /><br />So has anyone tried it out with the Doom3 Models? Don´t forget to set the path variable in the scene.txt file to your D3-base-directory.
<br /><br />And then you can try setting the nummodels to 7 (was 5 in the original scene.txt). Maybe you´ve noticed that the scene.txt contains two more models, #5 and #6, that have been ignored. That´s kind of an easter egg... lol.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p11139" date="Posted: Thu Aug 07, 2003 4:13 pm "><author>rich_is_bored</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I set it up to search my base directory but the only model it loaded was the pipes.

<br /><br />Sorry, no focus switching yet...
<br /><br />Sorry, the problem with pinky is very simple to solve.
<br />For pinky´s "modelname" attribute in the scene file, use "maps\fred\bathroom/scene1pinkymesh.md5mesh"
<br /><br />The background for the sidenote that I wrote into the scene.txt is that pinky´s texture cannot be found in all the other pinky meshes that exist in the alpha, only this scene1pinkymesh.md5mesh works. That´s because the texture name in the meshfile is "wrong" for all the other pinky-meshes. Doom3 doesn´t care about that texture name since it reads the mtr file to see what textures to use for pinky, but my viewer doesn´t bother looking up the mtr file but tries to find the texture that´s written there in the mesh.
<br /><br />I found out that there´s a pinky mesh with the correct texture name just now, sorry. I always used a edited version of one of the other pinky-meshes.
<br /><br />By the way, if you want to see the scene with the two security guys and the scientist that bumps into one of them, put this into your scene.txt (instead of all the other modelstuff there):
<br /><br />nummodels 3 
<br /><br />model 0
<br />modelname "models\md5\meshes/scientist1.md5mesh"
<br />modelanim "models\md5\anims\cinematics/cin_lobby_sci.md5anim"
<br />modelpos 195.791 -102.819 0
<br /><br />model 1
<br />modelname "models\md5\meshes/security.md5mesh"
<br />modelanim "models\md5\anims\cinematics/cin_lobby_sec1.md5anim"
<br />modelpos -145.609 193.743 0
<br /><br />model 2
<br />modelname "models\md5\meshes/security.md5mesh"

Perhaps a shortcut key to bring up a browse window for the model in focus which allows you to select a md5 model or animation. Then the selected model or animation would replace the model or animation in focus.
<br /><br />It's still a great piece of software der_ton. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205111328im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p14349" date="Posted: Thu Oct 16, 2003 7:47 pm "><author>kat</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">my version isn't reading any of the D3 content... the butterfly etc show up but non of the game content.

Not even if you put the pathnames in " " ...
<br /><br />In the included scene.txt, you can just make two changes and you´ll see pinky breaking through the walls (if you have the alpha ofcourse):
<br />- change the first line that says <span style="font-weight: bold">basepath</span>, to point to the base dir of the alpha.
<br />- change the line that says "nummodels 3" to "nummodels 5". The models number 3 and 4 (count starts at zero so it´s 5 models then) are pinky and the wall. The other models (number 0, 1 and 2) will still be there.
<br />Yeah this is inconvenient, it would be easier to handle if the numbers were just left out and all the models in the scene.txt would be read. Ofcourse the best thing would be on the fly model loading like rich pointed out.
<br /><br />matt, what exactly do you mean with the "skinless" pinky? is it white, completely without textures?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p14409" date="Posted: Fri Oct 17, 2003 10:52 pm "><author>rich_is_bored</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Oh, I just had another idea.

I'm trying a similar normal-mapped app myself, and since I got the doom3 models &amp; normal maps I figured I'd use them to learn how to do it. So I have a few technical questions if you don't mind! (that is if you still hang around here..)
<br /><br />Are you using tangent-space bump-mapping? This is what I've been trying, but I haven't been having too much success. I'm using a vertex program to set it up, and then register combiners to do the dot product. However it all seems to be far too bright, compared with just standard opengl lighting. Also, the diffuse map seems to be very washed out - the model doesn't show up half the detail that should be there. I know this is a little vague, and if you're willing to answer a few questions I'll go into greater detail, but I just thought you might have come across the same sort of problems as me, and might be able to point me in the right direction!
<br /><br />I'm not doing specular yet, since once I have this figured out then it shouldnt be too hard to extend it to include a gloss map. And I'm not using the height map texture either, just the base texture map and the normal map - would this be something to do with my problems?
<br /><br />Here's an example:...
<br /><span style="font-style: italic">&lt;&lt;screenshot removed&gt;&gt;</span>

<br /><br /><br />So has anyone tried it out with the Doom3 Models? Don´t forget to set the path variable in the scene.txt file to your D3-base-directory.
<br /><br />And then you can try setting the nummodels to 7 (was 5 in the original scene.txt). Maybe you´ve noticed that the scene.txt contains two more models, #5 and #6, that have been ignored.

<br /><br />Sorry, no focus switching yet...
<br /><br />Sorry, the problem with pinky is very simple to solve.
<br />For pinky´s "modelname" attribute in the scene file, use "maps\fred\bathroom/scene1pinkymesh.md5mesh"
<br /><br />The background for the sidenote that I wrote into the scene.txt is that pinky´s texture cannot be found in all the other pinky meshes that exist in the alpha, only this scene1pinkymesh.md5mesh works. That´s because the texture name in the meshfile is "wrong" for all the other pinky-meshes. Doom3 doesn´t care about that texture name since it reads the mtr file to see what textures to use for pinky, but my viewer doesn´t bother looking up the mtr file but tries to find the texture that´s written there in the mesh.
<br /><br />I found out that there´s a pinky mesh with the correct texture name just now, sorry. I always used a edited version of one of the other pinky-meshes.
<br /><br />By the way, if you want to see the scene with the two security guys and the scientist that bumps into one of them, put this into your scene.txt (instead of all the other modelstuff there):
<br /><br />nummodels 3 
<br /><br />model 0
<br />modelname "models\md5\meshes/scientist1.md5mesh"
<br />modelanim "models\md5\anims\cinematics/cin_lobby_sci.md5anim"
<br />modelpos 195.791 -102.819 0
<br /><br />model 1

Not even if you put the pathnames in " " ...
<br /><br />In the included scene.txt, you can just make two changes and you´ll see pinky breaking through the walls (if you have the alpha ofcourse):
<br />- change the first line that says <span style="font-weight: bold">basepath</span>, to point to the base dir of the alpha.
<br />- change the line that says "nummodels 3" to "nummodels 5". The models number 3 and 4 (count starts at zero so it´s 5 models then) are pinky and the wall. The other models (number 0, 1 and 2) will still be there.
<br />Yeah this is inconvenient, it would be easier to handle if the numbers were just left out and all the models in the scene.txt would be read. Ofcourse the best thing would be on the fly model loading like rich pointed out.

I'm trying a similar normal-mapped app myself, and since I got the doom3 models &amp; normal maps I figured I'd use them to learn how to do it. So I have a few technical questions if you don't mind! (that is if you still hang around here..)
<br /><br />Are you using tangent-space bump-mapping? This is what I've been trying, but I haven't been having too much success. I'm using a vertex program to set it up, and then register combiners to do the dot product. However it all seems to be far too bright, compared with just standard opengl lighting. Also, the diffuse map seems to be very washed out - the model doesn't show up half the detail that should be there. I know this is a little vague, and if you're willing to answer a few questions I'll go into greater detail, but I just thought you might have come across the same sort of problems as me, and might be able to point me in the right direction!
<br /><br />I'm not doing specular yet, since once I have this figured out then it shouldnt be too hard to extend it to include a gloss map. And I'm not using the height map texture either, just the base texture map and the normal map - would this be something to do with my problems?
<br /><br />Here's an example:...

<br />About projected spotlights, just bind it in 4th texUnit
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">tex#0</span>: NormalMap
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">tex#1</span>: Cubemap for NormalMap
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">tex#2</span>: Diffusemap (then Specularmap at second pass)
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">tex#3</span>: 2D Spotlights map (3D tex is workable if you care about vertical attenuation by light)
<br />For 2 texUnits card:
<br />Need more twice pass as above. 
<br />tex#0,#1 at first pass to alpha-buffer
<br />tex#2,#3 at second pass to blend with alpha-buffer.
<br />Then do again for specularmap
<br /><br />About Cull, sure! Mesh would be culled if outside light's frustum or outside camera's frustum.
<br /><br />I also have many improvement to do in the future. Such as:
<br />a. use fragment program to do single pass(w/diffuse, specular) per light 
<br />b. use two-side stencil (UltraShadow via nVidia)
<br />c. use vertex program

The textures that are semitranslucent/blended? They should load up and display completely opaque, because I'm not checking the material definitions to see how they should be rendered. 
<br />You might have to make a copy of the md5mesh and change the shader line to directly reference the diffuse color tga. In order to find out which tga that is, you have to first look up the material definition of that shader (in one of the material files, for monsters its monsters.mtr).</div>]]></body></post><post id="p41696" date="Posted: Wed Aug 25, 2004 5:58 pm "><author>Giggione</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">A littel question?

Like I wrote in the viewer's readme, it doesn't extract the pk4 files automatically.
<br /><br />In some cases, the shader names do not correspond with the tga names (because the shader references the tgas in the .mtr files). The modelviewer doesn't read these .mtr files, and some textures will not display unless you modify the shader in the md5 file (make a copy and edit it with a text editor).</div>]]></body></post><post id="p44705" date="Posted: Tue Aug 31, 2004 9:57 am "><author>DaNg3R</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">tnx 1k <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225085311im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8)" title="Cool" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p52473" date="Posted: Wed Sep 22, 2004 3:33 pm "><author>CHaSE</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">

I hope it´s self-explanatory. And you guys just LOVE anything that looks like a ascii-script, right? ;-D<br /><br />Sorry for the shitty specular lighting... it´s difficult to do that in a optically correct way with 4 texture units and using no NV or ATI extension.

And it doesn´t use vertex programs (yet), so all the math is done by the CPU. <br />And the framerate used to be twice as high, until I had to restructure the tangent space calculation because of the symmetry seam issue.<br /><br />There was so much more that I wanted to mention about the program, but let´s do it the other way round, just ask questions of what you want to know.

<br /><br /><br />So has anyone tried it out with the Doom3 Models? Don´t forget to set the path variable in the scene.txt file to your D3-base-directory.
<br /><br />And then you can try setting the nummodels to 7 (was 5 in the original scene.txt). Maybe you´ve noticed that the scene.txt contains two more models, #5 and #6, that have been ignored.

<br /><br />Sorry, no focus switching yet...
<br /><br />Sorry, the problem with pinky is very simple to solve.
<br />For pinky´s "modelname" attribute in the scene file, use "maps\fred\bathroom/scene1pinkymesh.md5mesh"
<br /><br />The background for the sidenote that I wrote into the scene.txt is that pinky´s texture cannot be found in all the other pinky meshes that exist in the alpha, only this scene1pinkymesh.md5mesh works. That´s because the texture name in the meshfile is "wrong" for all the other pinky-meshes. Doom3 doesn´t care about that texture name since it reads the mtr file to see what textures to use for pinky, but my viewer doesn´t bother looking up the mtr file but tries to find the texture that´s written there in the mesh.
<br /><br />I found out that there´s a pinky mesh with the correct texture name just now, sorry. I always used a edited version of one of the other pinky-meshes.
<br /><br />By the way, if you want to see the scene with the two security guys and the scientist that bumps into one of them, put this into your scene.txt (instead of all the other modelstuff there):
<br /><br />nummodels 3 
<br /><br />model 0
<br />modelname "models\md5\meshes/scientist1.md5mesh"
<br />modelanim "models\md5\anims\cinematics/cin_lobby_sci.md5anim"
<br />modelpos 195.791 -102.819 0
<br /><br />model 1

Not even if you put the pathnames in " " ...
<br /><br />In the included scene.txt, you can just make two changes and you´ll see pinky breaking through the walls (if you have the alpha ofcourse):
<br />- change the first line that says <span style="font-weight: bold">basepath</span>, to point to the base dir of the alpha.
<br />- change the line that says "nummodels 3" to "nummodels 5". The models number 3 and 4 (count starts at zero so it´s 5 models then) are pinky and the wall. The other models (number 0, 1 and 2) will still be there.
<br />Yeah this is inconvenient, it would be easier to handle if the numbers were just left out and all the models in the scene.txt would be read. Ofcourse the best thing would be on the fly model loading like rich pointed out.

I'm trying a similar normal-mapped app myself, and since I got the doom3 models &amp; normal maps I figured I'd use them to learn how to do it. So I have a few technical questions if you don't mind! (that is if you still hang around here..)
<br /><br />Are you using tangent-space bump-mapping? This is what I've been trying, but I haven't been having too much success. I'm using a vertex program to set it up, and then register combiners to do the dot product. However it all seems to be far too bright, compared with just standard opengl lighting. Also, the diffuse map seems to be very washed out - the model doesn't show up half the detail that should be there. I know this is a little vague, and if you're willing to answer a few questions I'll go into greater detail, but I just thought you might have come across the same sort of problems as me, and might be able to point me in the right direction!
<br /><br />I'm not doing specular yet, since once I have this figured out then it shouldnt be too hard to extend it to include a gloss map. And I'm not using the height map texture either, just the base texture map and the normal map - would this be something to do with my problems?
<br /><br />Here's an example:...

<br />About projected spotlights, just bind it in 4th texUnit
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">tex#0</span>: NormalMap
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">tex#1</span>: Cubemap for NormalMap
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">tex#2</span>: Diffusemap (then Specularmap at second pass)
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">tex#3</span>: 2D Spotlights map (3D tex is workable if you care about vertical attenuation by light)
<br />For 2 texUnits card:
<br />Need more twice pass as above. 
<br />tex#0,#1 at first pass to alpha-buffer
<br />tex#2,#3 at second pass to blend with alpha-buffer.
<br />Then do again for specularmap
<br /><br />About Cull, sure! Mesh would be culled if outside light's frustum or outside camera's frustum.
<br /><br />I also have many improvement to do in the future. Such as:
<br />a. use fragment program to do single pass(w/diffuse, specular) per light 
<br />b. use two-side stencil (UltraShadow via nVidia)
<br />c. use vertex program

<br />You might have to make a copy of the md5mesh and change the shader line to directly reference the diffuse color tga.

<br /><br />In some cases, the shader names do not correspond with the tga names (because the shader references the tgas in the .mtr files).

I hope it´s self-explanatory. And you guys just LOVE anything that looks like a ascii-script, right? ;-D<br /><br />Sorry for the shitty specular lighting... it´s difficult to do that in a optically correct way with 4 texture units and using no NV or ATI extension.

And I don´t have any assembly language inner loops, not to mention MMX/SSE stuff. And it doesn´t use vertex programs (yet), so all the math is done by the CPU. <br />And the framerate used to be twice as high, until I had to restructure the tangent space calculation because of the symmetry seam issue.<br /><br />There was so much more that I wanted to mention about the program, but let´s do it the other way round, just ask questions of what you want to know.

<br /><br />Sorry, no focus switching yet...
<br /><br />Sorry, the problem with pinky is very simple to solve.
<br />For pinky´s "modelname" attribute in the scene file, use "maps\fred\bathroom/scene1pinkymesh.md5mesh"
<br /><br />The background for the sidenote that I wrote into the scene.txt is that pinky´s texture cannot be found in all the other pinky meshes that exist in the alpha, only this scene1pinkymesh.md5mesh works. That´s because the texture name in the meshfile is "wrong" for all the other pinky-meshes. Doom3 doesn´t care about that texture name since it reads the mtr file to see what textures to use for pinky, but my viewer doesn´t bother looking up the mtr file but tries to find the texture that´s written there in the mesh.
<br /><br />I found out that there´s a pinky mesh with the correct texture name just now, sorry. I always used a edited version of one of the other pinky-meshes.
<br /><br />By the way, if you want to see the scene with the two security guys and the scientist that bumps into one of them, put this into your scene.txt (instead of all the other modelstuff there):
<br /><br />nummodels 3 
<br /><br />model 0
<br />modelname "models\md5\meshes/scientist1.md5mesh"
<br />modelanim "models\md5\anims\cinematics/cin_lobby_sci.md5anim"
<br />modelpos 195.791 -102.819 0
<br /><br />model 1

Not even if you put the pathnames in " " ...
<br /><br />In the included scene.txt, you can just make two changes and you´ll see pinky breaking through the walls (if you have the alpha ofcourse):
<br />- change the first line that says <span style="font-weight: bold">basepath</span>, to point to the base dir of the alpha.
<br />- change the line that says "nummodels 3" to "nummodels 5". The models number 3 and 4 (count starts at zero so it´s 5 models then) are pinky and the wall. The other models (number 0, 1 and 2) will still be there.
<br />Yeah this is inconvenient, it would be easier to handle if the numbers were just left out and all the models in the scene.txt would be read. Ofcourse the best thing would be on the fly model loading like rich pointed out.

I'm trying a similar normal-mapped app myself, and since I got the doom3 models &amp; normal maps I figured I'd use them to learn how to do it. So I have a few technical questions if you don't mind! (that is if you still hang around here..)
<br /><br />Are you using tangent-space bump-mapping? This is what I've been trying, but I haven't been having too much success. I'm using a vertex program to set it up, and then register combiners to do the dot product. However it all seems to be far too bright, compared with just standard opengl lighting. Also, the diffuse map seems to be very washed out - the model doesn't show up half the detail that should be there. I know this is a little vague, and if you're willing to answer a few questions I'll go into greater detail, but I just thought you might have come across the same sort of problems as me, and might be able to point me in the right direction!
<br /><br />I'm not doing specular yet, since once I have this figured out then it shouldnt be too hard to extend it to include a gloss map. And I'm not using the height map texture either, just the base texture map and the normal map - would this be something to do with my problems?
<br /><br />Here's an example:...

<br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.geocities.com/macbearchen/data/md5mesh.jpg" alt="Image" /><br />The program is use to demo the bumpmap, perpixel lighting via real-time 3D graphics
<br /><br />=== 3D Graphics technology ===
<br />1. shadow-volume
<br />2. many dynamic lights, and single ambient light
<br />3. bumpmap with diffuse and specular map
<br />4. Support 3D model by md5mesh format (used in DOOM3), and md5anim animation file
<br />5. Support 3D model by ASE format (3DSMAX ASE file export)
<br /><br />=== System requirement ===
<br />* Windows XP/2000/98/ME Traditional Chinese with OpenGL 1.3 ICD
<br />* 3D card:
<br />     nVidia Geforce Card from Geforce/Geforce2/2MX/3Ti/4200Ti or later
<br />     ATi Radeon 7x00/8500/9x00 or later
<br />-----------------------------------------
<br />I use some render-path for different Graphics cards:
<br /><span style="font-style: italic">2 texture-units card: use alpha buffer to temporary store bumpmap, then blend with diffuse and do specular pass</span>
<br /><span style="font-style: italic">4 texture-units card: render-path for specular pass via ATi and nVidia</span>
<br /><br />I read many useful posts here, and write the program.
<br />Any comment is welcome.

You could read "readme.txt" about English usage of my program.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">What's your render method for projected spotlights? Do you cull geometry that's outside of the light's frustum?</div>
<br />About projected spotlights, just bind it in 4th texUnit
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">tex#0</span>: NormalMap
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">tex#1</span>: Cubemap for NormalMap
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">tex#2</span>: Diffusemap (then Specularmap at second pass)
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">tex#3</span>: 2D Spotlights map (3D tex is workable if you care about vertical attenuation by light)
<br />For 2 texUnits card:
<br />Need more twice pass as above. 
<br />tex#0,#1 at first pass to alpha-buffer
<br />tex#2,#3 at second pass to blend with alpha-buffer.
<br />Then do again for specularmap
<br /><br />About Cull, sure! Mesh would be culled if outside light's frustum or outside camera's frustum.
<br /><br />I also have many improvement to do in the future. Such as:
<br />a. use fragment program to do single pass(w/diffuse, specular) per light 
<br />b. use two-side stencil (UltraShadow via nVidia)
<br />c. use vertex program
<br />d. etc...</div>]]></body></post><post id="p102788" date="Posted: Wed Jul 06, 2005 9:06 pm "><author>DiamondDave23</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I MAY SOUND STUPID BUT IM TRYING TO CREATE CUTSCENES FOR MY NEW MAP USING der_TONS  MOD VIEWER AND I CAN LOAD THE MD5 MESH MODEL OF THE Doom 3 Marine but his texture isnt there whats the problem</div>]]></body></post><post id="p102841" date="Posted: Thu Jul 07, 2005 7:57 am "><author>der_ton</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Doom3 uses a material system to get the correct look and the location of the texture files.

<br /><br />*  priority
<br />** secondary 
<br /><br />-=Workflow=-
<br /><br />*
<br />- Read config model in def files for quick navigation between model's sequences. 
<br />- Display names of bones in a short list dialog to select bones and highlightning the bone selected in viewport's model viewer, i suggest a new tab called Bones. 
<br /><br />**
<br />- Move to player view for better preview weapons animation.
<br /><br /><br />-=Render=-
<br /><br />*
<br />- Sketch render (uniform lightning) like this : 
<br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://redeye.free.fr/sketch_view.jpg" alt="Image" /><br />- Hide geometry for better understanding rigging model (bones only)
<br /><br />**
<br />- Display influence Bones (weight map)
<br /><br /><br />-=Textures=-
<br /><br />**
<br />- New Materials tab to display model's texture on model viewer viewport.
<br /><br /><br />If you have any other suggest for improve model viewer you can post it here =)

<br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.geocities.com/macbearchen/data/md5mesh.jpg" alt="Image" /><br />The program is use to demo the bumpmap, perpixel lighting via real-time 3D graphics
<br /><br />=== 3D Graphics technology ===
<br />1. shadow-volume
<br />2. many dynamic lights, and single ambient light
<br />3. bumpmap with diffuse and specular map
<br />4. Support 3D model by md5mesh format (used in DOOM3), and md5anim animation file
<br />5. Support 3D model by ASE format (3DSMAX ASE file export)
<br /><br />=== System requirement ===
<br />* Windows XP/2000/98/ME Traditional Chinese with OpenGL 1.3 ICD
<br />* 3D card:
<br />     nVidia Geforce Card from Geforce/Geforce2/2MX/3Ti/4200Ti or later
<br />     ATi Radeon 7x00/8500/9x00 or later
<br />-----------------------------------------
<br />I use some render-path for different Graphics cards:
<br /><span style="font-style: italic">2 texture-units card: use alpha buffer to temporary store bumpmap, then blend with diffuse and do specular pass</span>
<br /><span style="font-style: italic">4 texture-units card: render-path for specular pass via ATi and nVidia</span>
<br /><br />I read many useful posts here, and write the program.
<br />Any comment is welcome.
<br /><br />ps: The file is located on geocities, data transfer quota is limited.
<br />     So if you can't download it right now, try again later. Sorry...</div>

						<div class="postbody">Nice work, macbearchen!
<br />And it's a bit faster than my viewer. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br />About the system requirements: it worked for me even though I don't have a Traditional Chinese Windows. Maybe there's some nonstandard font necessary that I happen to have installed.

<br />About projected spotlights, just bind it in 4th texUnit
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">tex#0</span>: NormalMap
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">tex#1</span>: Cubemap for NormalMap
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">tex#2</span>: Diffusemap (then Specularmap at second pass)
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">tex#3</span>: 2D Spotlights map (3D tex is workable if you care about vertical attenuation by light)
<br />For 2 texUnits card:
<br />Need more twice pass as above. 
<br />tex#0,#1 at first pass to alpha-buffer
<br />tex#2,#3 at second pass to blend with alpha-buffer.
<br />Then do again for specularmap
<br /><br />About Cull, sure! Mesh would be culled if outside light's frustum or outside camera's frustum.
<br /><br />I also have many improvement to do in the future. Such as:
<br />a. use fragment program to do single pass(w/diffuse, specular) per light 
<br />b. use two-side stencil (UltraShadow via nVidia)
<br />c. use vertex program
<br />d. etc...</div>

						<div class="postbody">Doom3 uses a material system to get the correct look and the location of the texture files. My viewer doesn't, for simplicity's sake.
<br /><br />You will have to extract the textures from pak002.pk4, and then edit the "shader" lines in a .md5mesh file to point directly to the correct textures.
<br /><br />There are a couple of explanations on page 4 of this thread, too. I hope that helps.</div>

When it looks deformed, I guess that the UV layouts of the texture and the model don't match.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">rich_is_bored wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Smoothing doesn't appear to be working on *.LWO models where as it does in Doom 3.</div>
<br />Can you tell me which LWO, and maybe take a screenshot? I did a bit of testing and most objects looked ok, with a few minor issues with the symmetry seam or discontinuous texturing.</div>

						<div class="postbody">Actually, I made a custom *.LWO for use with the material editor and that was the model I tested the your new modelviewer with.
<br /><br />I'll send it VIA email.
<br /><br />Just keep in mind that the model has a dummy shader name. There wasn't much point in creating a material shader for a model that was just going to display whatever material is selected in the material editor.</div>

						<div class="postbody">Hi all!
<br /><br />I have to suggest some new features for der_ton model viewer to improve a better workflow when you work with it.
<br /><br />*  priority
<br />** secondary 
<br /><br />-=Workflow=-
<br /><br />*
<br />- Read config model in def files for quick navigation between model's sequences. 
<br />- Display names of bones in a short list dialog to select bones and highlightning the bone selected in viewport's model viewer, i suggest a new tab called Bones. 
<br /><br />**
<br />- Move to player view for better preview weapons animation.
<br /><br /><br />-=Render=-
<br /><br />*
<br />- Sketch render (uniform lightning) like this : 
<br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://redeye.free.fr/sketch_view.jpg" alt="Image" /><br />- Hide geometry for better understanding rigging model (bones only)
<br /><br />**
<br />- Display influence Bones (weight map)
<br /><br /><br />-=Textures=-
<br /><br />**
<br />- New Materials tab to display model's texture on model viewer viewport.
<br /><br /><br />If you have any other suggest for improve model viewer you can post it here =)
<br /><br />Bye!</div>

<br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.geocities.com/macbearchen/data/md5mesh.jpg" alt="Image" /><br />The program is use to demo the bumpmap, perpixel lighting via real-time 3D graphics
<br /><br />=== 3D Graphics technology ===
<br />1. shadow-volume
<br />2. many dynamic lights, and single ambient light
<br />3. bumpmap with diffuse and specular map
<br />4. Support 3D model by md5mesh format (used in DOOM3), and md5anim animation file
<br />5. Support 3D model by ASE format (3DSMAX ASE file export)
<br /><br />=== System requirement ===
<br />* Windows XP/2000/98/ME Traditional Chinese with OpenGL 1.3 ICD
<br />* 3D card:
<br />     nVidia Geforce Card from Geforce/Geforce2/2MX/3Ti/4200Ti or later
<br />     ATi Radeon 7x00/8500/9x00 or later
<br />-----------------------------------------
<br />I use some render-path for different Graphics cards:
<br /><span style="font-style: italic">2 texture-units card: use alpha buffer to temporary store bumpmap, then blend with diffuse and do specular pass</span>
<br /><span style="font-style: italic">4 texture-units card: render-path for specular pass via ATi and nVidia</span>
<br /><br />I read many useful posts here, and write the program.
<br />Any comment is welcome.
<br /><br />ps: The file is located on geocities, data transfer quota is limited.
<br />     So if you can't download it right now, try again later.

You could read "readme.txt" about English usage of my program.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">What's your render method for projected spotlights? Do you cull geometry that's outside of the light's frustum?</div>
<br />About projected spotlights, just bind it in 4th texUnit
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">tex#0</span>: NormalMap
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">tex#1</span>: Cubemap for NormalMap
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">tex#2</span>: Diffusemap (then Specularmap at second pass)
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">tex#3</span>: 2D Spotlights map (3D tex is workable if you care about vertical attenuation by light)
<br />For 2 texUnits card:
<br />Need more twice pass as above. 
<br />tex#0,#1 at first pass to alpha-buffer
<br />tex#2,#3 at second pass to blend with alpha-buffer.
<br />Then do again for specularmap
<br /><br />About Cull, sure! Mesh would be culled if outside light's frustum or outside camera's frustum.
<br /><br />I also have many improvement to do in the future. Such as:
<br />a. use fragment program to do single pass(w/diffuse, specular) per light 
<br />b. use two-side stencil (UltraShadow via nVidia)
<br />c. use vertex program
<br />d. etc...</div>]]></body></post><post id="p102788" date="Posted: Wed Jul 06, 2005 9:06 pm "><author>DiamondDave23</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I MAY SOUND STUPID BUT IM TRYING TO CREATE CUTSCENES FOR MY NEW MAP USING der_TONS  MOD VIEWER AND I CAN LOAD THE MD5 MESH MODEL OF THE Doom 3 Marine but his texture isnt there whats the problem</div>]]></body></post><post id="p102841" date="Posted: Thu Jul 07, 2005 7:57 am "><author>der_ton</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Doom3 uses a material system to get the correct look and the location of the texture files.

						<div class="postbody">when i load it the model either looks black or looks wierd and choppy, like u see random triangles being ignored by the lighting. One way or another it never really looks like rendering the normal map.

<br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.geocities.com/macbearchen/data/md5mesh_macbear.zip" class="postlink">md5mesh_macbear.zip</a>
<br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.geocities.com/macbearchen/data/md5mesh.jpg" alt="Image" /><br />The program is use to demo the bumpmap, perpixel lighting via real-time 3D graphics
<br /><br />=== 3D Graphics technology ===
<br />1. shadow-volume
<br />2. many dynamic lights, and single ambient light
<br />3. bumpmap with diffuse and specular map
<br />4. Support 3D model by md5mesh format (used in DOOM3), and md5anim animation file
<br />5. Support 3D model by ASE format (3DSMAX ASE file export)
<br /><br />=== System requirement ===
<br />* Windows XP/2000/98/ME Traditional Chinese with OpenGL 1.3 ICD
<br />* 3D card:
<br />     nVidia Geforce Card from Geforce/Geforce2/2MX/3Ti/4200Ti or later
<br />     ATi Radeon 7x00/8500/9x00 or later
<br />-----------------------------------------
<br />I use some render-path for different Graphics cards:
<br /><span style="font-style: italic">2 texture-units card: use alpha buffer to temporary store bumpmap, then blend with diffuse and do specular pass</span>
<br /><span style="font-style: italic">4 texture-units card: render-path for specular pass via ATi and nVidia</span>
<br /><br />I read many useful posts here, and write the program.
<br />Any comment is welcome.
<br /><br />ps: The file is located on geocities, data transfer quota is limited.
<br />     So if you can't download it right now, try again later. Sorry...</div>

						<div class="postbody">Nice work, macbearchen!
<br />And it's a bit faster than my viewer. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br />About the system requirements: it worked for me even though I don't have a Traditional Chinese Windows. Maybe there's some nonstandard font necessary that I happen to have installed.

<br />About projected spotlights, just bind it in 4th texUnit
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">tex#0</span>: NormalMap
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">tex#1</span>: Cubemap for NormalMap
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">tex#2</span>: Diffusemap (then Specularmap at second pass)
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">tex#3</span>: 2D Spotlights map (3D tex is workable if you care about vertical attenuation by light)
<br />For 2 texUnits card:
<br />Need more twice pass as above. 
<br />tex#0,#1 at first pass to alpha-buffer
<br />tex#2,#3 at second pass to blend with alpha-buffer.
<br />Then do again for specularmap
<br /><br />About Cull, sure! Mesh would be culled if outside light's frustum or outside camera's frustum.
<br /><br />I also have many improvement to do in the future. Such as:
<br />a. use fragment program to do single pass(w/diffuse, specular) per light 
<br />b. use two-side stencil (UltraShadow via nVidia)
<br />c. use vertex program
<br />d. etc...</div>

						<div class="postbody">Doom3 uses a material system to get the correct look and the location of the texture files. My viewer doesn't, for simplicity's sake.
<br /><br />You will have to extract the textures from pak002.pk4, and then edit the "shader" lines in a .md5mesh file to point directly to the correct textures.
<br /><br />There are a couple of explanations on page 4 of this thread, too. I hope that helps.</div>

When it looks deformed, I guess that the UV layouts of the texture and the model don't match.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">rich_is_bored wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Smoothing doesn't appear to be working on *.LWO models where as it does in Doom 3.</div>
<br />Can you tell me which LWO, and maybe take a screenshot? I did a bit of testing and most objects looked ok, with a few minor issues with the symmetry seam or discontinuous texturing.</div>

						<div class="postbody">Actually, I made a custom *.LWO for use with the material editor and that was the model I tested the your new modelviewer with.
<br /><br />I'll send it VIA email.
<br /><br />Just keep in mind that the model has a dummy shader name. There wasn't much point in creating a material shader for a model that was just going to display whatever material is selected in the material editor.</div>

						<div class="postbody">Hi all!
<br /><br />I have to suggest some new features for der_ton model viewer to improve a better workflow when you work with it.
<br /><br />*  priority
<br />** secondary 
<br /><br />-=Workflow=-
<br /><br />*
<br />- Read config model in def files for quick navigation between model's sequences. 
<br />- Display names of bones in a short list dialog to select bones and highlightning the bone selected in viewport's model viewer, i suggest a new tab called Bones. 
<br /><br />**
<br />- Move to player view for better preview weapons animation.
<br /><br /><br />-=Render=-
<br /><br />*
<br />- Sketch render (uniform lightning) like this : 
<br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://redeye.free.fr/sketch_view.jpg" alt="Image" /><br />- Hide geometry for better understanding rigging model (bones only)
<br /><br />**
<br />- Display influence Bones (weight map)
<br /><br /><br />-=Textures=-
<br /><br />**
<br />- New Materials tab to display model's texture on model viewer viewport.
<br /><br /><br />If you have any other suggest for improve model viewer you can post it here =)
<br /><br />Bye!</div>

<br /><br />About Cull, sure! Mesh would be culled if outside light's frustum or outside camera's frustum.
<br /><br />I also have many improvement to do in the future. Such as:
<br />a. use fragment program to do single pass(w/diffuse, specular) per light 
<br />b. use two-side stencil (UltraShadow via nVidia)
<br />c. use vertex program
<br />d. etc...</div>]]></body></post><post id="p102788" date="Posted: Wed Jul 06, 2005 9:06 pm "><author>DiamondDave23</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I MAY SOUND STUPID BUT IM TRYING TO CREATE CUTSCENES FOR MY NEW MAP USING der_TONS  MOD VIEWER AND I CAN LOAD THE MD5 MESH MODEL OF THE Doom 3 Marine but his texture isnt there whats the problem</div>]]></body></post><post id="p102841" date="Posted: Thu Jul 07, 2005 7:57 am "><author>der_ton</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Doom3 uses a material system to get the correct look and the location of the texture files.

<br /><br />I have to suggest some new features for der_ton model viewer to improve a better workflow when you work with it.
<br /><br />*  priority
<br />** secondary 
<br /><br />-=Workflow=-
<br /><br />*
<br />- Read config model in def files for quick navigation between model's sequences. 
<br />- Display names of bones in a short list dialog to select bones and highlightning the bone selected in viewport's model viewer, i suggest a new tab called Bones. 
<br /><br />**
<br />- Move to player view for better preview weapons animation.
<br /><br /><br />-=Render=-
<br /><br />*
<br />- Sketch render (uniform lightning) like this : 
<br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://redeye.free.fr/sketch_view.jpg" alt="Image" /><br />- Hide geometry for better understanding rigging model (bones only)
<br /><br />**
<br />- Display influence Bones (weight map)
<br /><br /><br />-=Textures=-
<br /><br />**
<br />- New Materials tab to display model's texture on model viewer viewport.
<br /><br /><br />If you have any other suggest for improve model viewer you can post it here =)
<br /><br />Bye!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p114647" date="Posted: Sun Oct 02, 2005 2:03 am "><author>Yak</author><body><![CDATA[<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>

<br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.geocities.com/macbearchen/data/md5mesh_macbear.zip" class="postlink">md5mesh_macbear.zip</a>
<br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.geocities.com/macbearchen/data/md5mesh.jpg" alt="Image" /><br />The program is use to demo the bumpmap, perpixel lighting via real-time 3D graphics
<br /><br />=== 3D Graphics technology ===
<br />1. shadow-volume
<br />2. many dynamic lights, and single ambient light
<br />3. bumpmap with diffuse and specular map
<br />4. Support 3D model by md5mesh format (used in DOOM3), and md5anim animation file
<br />5. Support 3D model by ASE format (3DSMAX ASE file export)
<br /><br />=== System requirement ===
<br />* Windows XP/2000/98/ME Traditional Chinese with OpenGL 1.3 ICD
<br />* 3D card:
<br />     nVidia Geforce Card from Geforce/Geforce2/2MX/3Ti/4200Ti or later
<br />     ATi Radeon 7x00/8500/9x00 or later
<br />-----------------------------------------
<br />I use some render-path for different Graphics cards:
<br /><span style="font-style: italic">2 texture-units card: use alpha buffer to temporary store bumpmap, then blend with diffuse and do specular pass</span>
<br /><span style="font-style: italic">4 texture-units card: render-path for specular pass via ATi and nVidia</span>
<br /><br />I read many useful posts here, and write the program.
<br />Any comment is welcome.
<br /><br />ps: The file is located on geocities, data transfer quota is limited.
<br />     So if you can't download it right now, try again later. Sorry...</div>

<br />About projected spotlights, just bind it in 4th texUnit
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">tex#0</span>: NormalMap
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">tex#1</span>: Cubemap for NormalMap
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">tex#2</span>: Diffusemap (then Specularmap at second pass)
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">tex#3</span>: 2D Spotlights map (3D tex is workable if you care about vertical attenuation by light)
<br />For 2 texUnits card:
<br />Need more twice pass as above. 
<br />tex#0,#1 at first pass to alpha-buffer
<br />tex#2,#3 at second pass to blend with alpha-buffer.
<br />Then do again for specularmap
<br /><br />About Cull, sure! Mesh would be culled if outside light's frustum or outside camera's frustum.
<br /><br />I also have many improvement to do in the future. Such as:
<br />a. use fragment program to do single pass(w/diffuse, specular) per light 
<br />b. use two-side stencil (UltraShadow via nVidia)
<br />c. use vertex program
<br />d. etc...</div>

						<div class="postbody">Doom3 uses a material system to get the correct look and the location of the texture files. My viewer doesn't, for simplicity's sake.
<br /><br />You will have to extract the textures from pak002.pk4, and then edit the "shader" lines in a .md5mesh file to point directly to the correct textures.
<br /><br />There are a couple of explanations on page 4 of this thread, too. I hope that helps.</div>

						<div class="postbody">Hi all!
<br /><br />I have to suggest some new features for der_ton model viewer to improve a better workflow when you work with it.
<br /><br />*  priority
<br />** secondary 
<br /><br />-=Workflow=-
<br /><br />*
<br />- Read config model in def files for quick navigation between model's sequences. 
<br />- Display names of bones in a short list dialog to select bones and highlightning the bone selected in viewport's model viewer, i suggest a new tab called Bones. 
<br /><br />**
<br />- Move to player view for better preview weapons animation.
<br /><br /><br />-=Render=-
<br /><br />*
<br />- Sketch render (uniform lightning) like this : 
<br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://redeye.free.fr/sketch_view.jpg" alt="Image" /><br />- Hide geometry for better understanding rigging model (bones only)
<br /><br />**
<br />- Display influence Bones (weight map)
<br /><br /><br />-=Textures=-
<br /><br />**
<br />- New Materials tab to display model's texture on model viewer viewport.
<br /><br /><br />If you have any other suggest for improve model viewer you can post it here =)
<br /><br />Bye!</div>

<br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.geocities.com/macbearchen/data/md5mesh.jpg" alt="Image" /><br />The program is use to demo the bumpmap, perpixel lighting via real-time 3D graphics
<br /><br />=== 3D Graphics technology ===
<br />1. shadow-volume
<br />2. many dynamic lights, and single ambient light
<br />3. bumpmap with diffuse and specular map
<br />4. Support 3D model by md5mesh format (used in DOOM3), and md5anim animation file
<br />5. Support 3D model by ASE format (3DSMAX ASE file export)
<br /><br />=== System requirement ===
<br />* Windows XP/2000/98/ME Traditional Chinese with OpenGL 1.3 ICD
<br />* 3D card:
<br />     nVidia Geforce Card from Geforce/Geforce2/2MX/3Ti/4200Ti or later
<br />     ATi Radeon 7x00/8500/9x00 or later
<br />-----------------------------------------
<br />I use some render-path for different Graphics cards:
<br /><span style="font-style: italic">2 texture-units card: use alpha buffer to temporary store bumpmap, then blend with diffuse and do specular pass</span>
<br /><span style="font-style: italic">4 texture-units card: render-path for specular pass via ATi and nVidia</span>
<br /><br />I read many useful posts here, and write the program.
<br />Any comment is welcome.
<br /><br />ps: The file is located on geocities, data transfer quota is limited.
<br />     So if you can't download it right now, try again later.

You could read "readme.txt" about English usage of my program.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">What's your render method for projected spotlights? Do you cull geometry that's outside of the light's frustum?</div>
<br />About projected spotlights, just bind it in 4th texUnit
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">tex#0</span>: NormalMap
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">tex#1</span>: Cubemap for NormalMap
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">tex#2</span>: Diffusemap (then Specularmap at second pass)
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">tex#3</span>: 2D Spotlights map (3D tex is workable if you care about vertical attenuation by light)
<br />For 2 texUnits card:
<br />Need more twice pass as above. 
<br />tex#0,#1 at first pass to alpha-buffer
<br />tex#2,#3 at second pass to blend with alpha-buffer.
<br />Then do again for specularmap
<br /><br />About Cull, sure! Mesh would be culled if outside light's frustum or outside camera's frustum.
<br /><br />I also have many improvement to do in the future. Such as:
<br />a. use fragment program to do single pass(w/diffuse, specular) per light 
<br />b. use two-side stencil (UltraShadow via nVidia)
<br />c. use vertex program
<br />d. etc...</div>]]></body></post><post id="p102788" date="Posted: Wed Jul 06, 2005 9:06 pm "><author>DiamondDave23</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I MAY SOUND STUPID BUT IM TRYING TO CREATE CUTSCENES FOR MY NEW MAP USING der_TONS  MOD VIEWER AND I CAN LOAD THE MD5 MESH MODEL OF THE Doom 3 Marine but his texture isnt there whats the problem</div>]]></body></post><post id="p102841" date="Posted: Thu Jul 07, 2005 7:57 am "><author>der_ton</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Doom3 uses a material system to get the correct look and the location of the texture files.

<br /><br />-=Workflow=-
<br /><br />*
<br />- Read config model in def files for quick navigation between model's sequences. 
<br />- Display names of bones in a short list dialog to select bones and highlightning the bone selected in viewport's model viewer, i suggest a new tab called Bones. 
<br /><br />**
<br />- Move to player view for better preview weapons animation.
<br /><br /><br />-=Render=-
<br /><br />*
<br />- Sketch render (uniform lightning) like this :

<br />- Display influence Bones (weight map)
<br /><br /><br />-=Textures=-

<br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.geocities.com/macbearchen/data/md5mesh_macbear.zip" class="postlink">md5mesh_macbear.zip</a>
<br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.geocities.com/macbearchen/data/md5mesh.jpg" alt="Image" /><br />The program is use to demo the bumpmap, perpixel lighting via real-time 3D graphics
<br /><br />=== 3D Graphics technology ===
<br />1. shadow-volume
<br />2. many dynamic lights, and single ambient light
<br />3. bumpmap with diffuse and specular map
<br />4. Support 3D model by md5mesh format (used in DOOM3), and md5anim animation file
<br />5. Support 3D model by ASE format (3DSMAX ASE file export)
<br /><br />=== System requirement ===
<br />* Windows XP/2000/98/ME Traditional Chinese with OpenGL 1.3 ICD
<br />* 3D card:
<br />     nVidia Geforce Card from Geforce/Geforce2/2MX/3Ti/4200Ti or later
<br />     ATi Radeon 7x00/8500/9x00 or later
<br />-----------------------------------------
<br />I use some render-path for different Graphics cards:
<br /><span style="font-style: italic">2 texture-units card: use alpha buffer to temporary store bumpmap, then blend with diffuse and do specular pass</span>
<br /><span style="font-style: italic">4 texture-units card: render-path for specular pass via ATi and nVidia</span>
<br /><br />I read many useful posts here, and write the program.
<br />Any comment is welcome.
<br /><br />ps: The file is located on geocities, data transfer quota is limited.
<br />     So if you can't download it right now, try again later. Sorry...</div>

						<div class="postbody">Nice work, macbearchen!
<br />And it's a bit faster than my viewer. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br />About the system requirements: it worked for me even though I don't have a Traditional Chinese Windows. Maybe there's some nonstandard font necessary that I happen to have installed.
<br /><br />What's your render method for projected spotlights? Do you cull geometry that's outside of the light's frustum?</div>

You could read "readme.txt" about English usage of my program.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">What's your render method for projected spotlights? Do you cull geometry that's outside of the light's frustum?</div>
<br />About projected spotlights, just bind it in 4th texUnit
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">tex#0</span>: NormalMap
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">tex#1</span>: Cubemap for NormalMap
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">tex#2</span>: Diffusemap (then Specularmap at second pass)
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">tex#3</span>: 2D Spotlights map (3D tex is workable if you care about vertical attenuation by light)
<br />For 2 texUnits card:
<br />Need more twice pass as above. 
<br />tex#0,#1 at first pass to alpha-buffer
<br />tex#2,#3 at second pass to blend with alpha-buffer.
<br />Then do again for specularmap
<br /><br />About Cull, sure! Mesh would be culled if outside light's frustum or outside camera's frustum.
<br /><br />I also have many improvement to do in the future. Such as:
<br />a. use fragment program to do single pass(w/diffuse, specular) per light 
<br />b. use two-side stencil (UltraShadow via nVidia)
<br />c. use vertex program
<br />d. etc...</div>

						<div class="postbody">Doom3 uses a material system to get the correct look and the location of the texture files. My viewer doesn't, for simplicity's sake.
<br /><br />You will have to extract the textures from pak002.pk4, and then edit the "shader" lines in a .md5mesh file to point directly to the correct textures.
<br /><br />There are a couple of explanations on page 4 of this thread, too. I hope that helps.</div>

						<div class="postbody">Actually, I made a custom *.LWO for use with the material editor and that was the model I tested the your new modelviewer with.
<br /><br />I'll send it VIA email.
<br /><br />Just keep in mind that the model has a dummy shader name. There wasn't much point in creating a material shader for a model that was just going to display whatever material is selected in the material editor.</div>

						<div class="postbody">Hi all!
<br /><br />I have to suggest some new features for der_ton model viewer to improve a better workflow when you work with it.
<br /><br />*  priority
<br />** secondary 
<br /><br />-=Workflow=-
<br /><br />*
<br />- Read config model in def files for quick navigation between model's sequences. 
<br />- Display names of bones in a short list dialog to select bones and highlightning the bone selected in viewport's model viewer, i suggest a new tab called Bones. 
<br /><br />**
<br />- Move to player view for better preview weapons animation.
<br /><br /><br />-=Render=-
<br /><br />*
<br />- Sketch render (uniform lightning) like this : 
<br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://redeye.free.fr/sketch_view.jpg" alt="Image" /><br />- Hide geometry for better understanding rigging model (bones only)
<br /><br />**
<br />- Display influence Bones (weight map)
<br /><br /><br />-=Textures=-
<br /><br />**
<br />- New Materials tab to display model's texture on model viewer viewport.
<br /><br /><br />If you have any other suggest for improve model viewer you can post it here =)
<br /><br />Bye!</div>

I hope it´s self-explanatory. And you guys just LOVE anything that looks like a ascii-script, right? ;-D<br /><br />Sorry for the shitty specular lighting... it´s difficult to do that in a optically correct way with 4 texture units and using no NV or ATI extension.

<br /><br />Sorry, no focus switching yet...
<br /><br />Sorry, the problem with pinky is very simple to solve.
<br />For pinky´s "modelname" attribute in the scene file, use "maps\fred\bathroom/scene1pinkymesh.md5mesh"
<br /><br />The background for the sidenote that I wrote into the scene.txt is that pinky´s texture cannot be found in all the other pinky meshes that exist in the alpha, only this scene1pinkymesh.md5mesh works. That´s because the texture name in the meshfile is "wrong" for all the other pinky-meshes. Doom3 doesn´t care about that texture name since it reads the mtr file to see what textures to use for pinky, but my viewer doesn´t bother looking up the mtr file but tries to find the texture that´s written there in the mesh.
<br /><br />I found out that there´s a pinky mesh with the correct texture name just now, sorry. I always used a edited version of one of the other pinky-meshes.
<br /><br />By the way, if you want to see the scene with the two security guys and the scientist that bumps into one of them, put this into your scene.txt (instead of all the other modelstuff there):
<br /><br />nummodels 3 
<br /><br />model 0
<br />modelname "models\md5\meshes/scientist1.md5mesh"
<br />modelanim "models\md5\anims\cinematics/cin_lobby_sci.md5anim"
<br />modelpos 195.791 -102.819 0

Not even if you put the pathnames in " " ...
<br /><br />In the included scene.txt, you can just make two changes and you´ll see pinky breaking through the walls (if you have the alpha ofcourse):
<br />- change the first line that says <span style="font-weight: bold">basepath</span>, to point to the base dir of the alpha.
<br />- change the line that says "nummodels 3" to "nummodels 5". The models number 3 and 4 (count starts at zero so it´s 5 models then) are pinky and the wall. The other models (number 0, 1 and 2) will still be there.
<br />Yeah this is inconvenient, it would be easier to handle if the numbers were just left out and all the models in the scene.txt would be read. Ofcourse the best thing would be on the fly model loading like rich pointed out.

I'm trying a similar normal-mapped app myself, and since I got the doom3 models &amp; normal maps I figured I'd use them to learn how to do it. So I have a few technical questions if you don't mind! (that is if you still hang around here..)
<br /><br />Are you using tangent-space bump-mapping? This is what I've been trying, but I haven't been having too much success. I'm using a vertex program to set it up, and then register combiners to do the dot product. However it all seems to be far too bright, compared with just standard opengl lighting. Also, the diffuse map seems to be very washed out - the model doesn't show up half the detail that should be there. I know this is a little vague, and if you're willing to answer a few questions I'll go into greater detail, but I just thought you might have come across the same sort of problems as me, and might be able to point me in the right direction!
<br /><br />I'm not doing specular yet, since once I have this figured out then it shouldnt be too hard to extend it to include a gloss map. And I'm not using the height map texture either, just the base texture map and the normal map - would this be something to do with my problems?
<br /><br />Here's an example:...

<br /><br />Sorry, no focus switching yet...
<br /><br />Sorry, the problem with pinky is very simple to solve.
<br />For pinky´s "modelname" attribute in the scene file, use "maps\fred\bathroom/scene1pinkymesh.md5mesh"
<br /><br />The background for the sidenote that I wrote into the scene.txt is that pinky´s texture cannot be found in all the other pinky meshes that exist in the alpha, only this scene1pinkymesh.md5mesh works. That´s because the texture name in the meshfile is "wrong" for all the other pinky-meshes. Doom3 doesn´t care about that texture name since it reads the mtr file to see what textures to use for pinky, but my viewer doesn´t bother looking up the mtr file but tries to find the texture that´s written there in the mesh.
<br /><br />I found out that there´s a pinky mesh with the correct texture name just now, sorry. I always used a edited version of one of the other pinky-meshes.
<br /><br />By the way, if you want to see the scene with the two security guys and the scientist that bumps into one of them, put this into your scene.txt (instead of all the other modelstuff there):
<br /><br />nummodels 3 
<br /><br />model 0
<br />modelname "models\md5\meshes/scientist1.md5mesh"
<br />modelanim "models\md5\anims\cinematics/cin_lobby_sci.md5anim"
<br />modelpos 195.791 -102.819 0
<br /><br />model 1
<br />modelname "models\md5\meshes/security.md5mesh"
<br />modelanim "models\md5\anims\cinematics/cin_lobby_sec1.md5anim"
<br />modelpos -145.609 193.743 0

Not even if you put the pathnames in " " ...
<br /><br />In the included scene.txt, you can just make two changes and you´ll see pinky breaking through the walls (if you have the alpha ofcourse):
<br />- change the first line that says <span style="font-weight: bold">basepath</span>, to point to the base dir of the alpha.
<br />- change the line that says "nummodels 3" to "nummodels 5". The models number 3 and 4 (count starts at zero so it´s 5 models then) are pinky and the wall. The other models (number 0, 1 and 2) will still be there.
<br />Yeah this is inconvenient, it would be easier to handle if the numbers were just left out and all the models in the scene.txt would be read. Ofcourse the best thing would be on the fly model loading like rich pointed out.

How do you switch the object in focus?</div>&#13;<br /><br />Sorry, no focus switching yet...&#13;<br /><br />Sorry, the problem with pinky is very simple to solve.&#13;<br />For pinky´s "modelname" attribute in the scene file, use "maps\fred\bathroom/scene1pinkymesh.md5mesh"&#13;<br /><br />The background for the sidenote that I wrote into the scene.txt is that pinky´s texture cannot be found in all the other pinky meshes that exist in the alpha, only this scene1pinkymesh.md5mesh works. That´s because the texture name in the meshfile is "wrong" for all the other pinky-meshes. Doom3 doesn´t care about that texture name since it reads the mtr file to see what textures to use for pinky, but my viewer doesn´t bother looking up the mtr file but tries to find the texture that´s written there in the mesh.&#13;<br /><br />I found out that there´s a pinky mesh with the correct texture name just now, sorry. I always used a edited version of one of the other pinky-meshes.&#13;<br /><br />By the way, if you want to see the scene with the two security guys and the scientist that bumps into one of them, put this into your scene.txt (instead of all the other modelstuff there):&#13;<br /><br />nummodels 3 &#13;<br /><br />model 0&#13;<br />modelname "models\md5\meshes/scientist1.md5mesh"&#13;<br />modelanim "models\md5\anims\cinematics/cin_lobby_sci.md5anim"&#13;<br />modelpos 195.791 -102.819 0&#13;<br /><br />model 1&#13;<br />modelname "models\md5\meshes/security.md5mesh"&#13;<br />modelanim "models\md5\anims\cinematics/cin_lobby_sec1.md5anim"&#13;<br />modelpos -145.609 193.743 0&#13;<br /><br />model 2&#13;<br />modelname "models\md5\meshes/security.md5mesh"&#13;<br />modelanim "models\md5\anims\cinematics/cin_lobby_sec2.md5anim"&#13;<br />modelangle 0&#13;<br />modelpos 219.212 36.194 0</div>]]></body></post><post id="p14299" date="Posted: Thu Oct 16, 2003 12:18 am "><author>der_ton</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">There´s a new version,&#13;<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/doom3/der_ton/modelviewer.zip">http://www.doom3world.org/doom3/der_ton/modelviewer.zip</a><!-- m -->&#13;<br /><br />-improved specular lighting on Geforce3+&#13;<br />-switch the object in focus (thanks rich)&#13;<br />-improved flexibility for camera movement&#13;<br />-can draw character skeletons&#13;<br />-reads obj and ase models, too&#13;<br /><br />Nothing stunning, but I felt like improving it a little more. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p14308" date="Posted: Thu Oct 16, 2003 2:30 am "><author>kat</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">downloaded for a looksee..</div>]]></body></post><post id="p14309" date="Posted: Thu Oct 16, 2003 4:00 am "><author>rich_is_bored</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">You know what would be real nice is if you could change the models/animations being rendered without editing the scene.txt.

Not even if you put the pathnames in " " ...&#13;<br /><br />In the included scene.txt, you can just make two changes and you´ll see pinky breaking through the walls (if you have the alpha ofcourse):&#13;<br />- change the first line that says <span style="font-weight: bold">basepath</span>, to point to the base dir of the alpha.&#13;<br />- change the line that says "nummodels 3" to "nummodels 5". The models number 3 and 4 (count starts at zero so it´s 5 models then) are pinky and the wall. The other models (number 0, 1 and 2) will still be there.&#13;<br />Yeah this is inconvenient, it would be easier to handle if the numbers were just left out and all the models in the scene.txt would be read. Ofcourse the best thing would be on the fly model loading like rich pointed out.&#13;<br /><br />matt, what exactly do you mean with the "skinless" pinky? is it white, completely without textures?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p14409" date="Posted: Fri Oct 17, 2003 10:52 pm "><author>rich_is_bored</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Oh, I just had another idea.

I'm trying a similar normal-mapped app myself, and since I got the doom3 models &amp; normal maps I figured I'd use them to learn how to do it. So I have a few technical questions if you don't mind! (that is if you still hang around here..)&#13;<br /><br />Are you using tangent-space bump-mapping? This is what I've been trying, but I haven't been having too much success. I'm using a vertex program to set it up, and then register combiners to do the dot product. However it all seems to be far too bright, compared with just standard opengl lighting. Also, the diffuse map seems to be very washed out - the model doesn't show up half the detail that should be there. I know this is a little vague, and if you're willing to answer a few questions I'll go into greater detail, but I just thought you might have come across the same sort of problems as me, and might be able to point me in the right direction!&#13;<br /><br />I'm not doing specular yet, since once I have this figured out then it shouldnt be too hard to extend it to include a gloss map. And I'm not using the height map texture either, just the base texture map and the normal map - would this be something to do with my problems?&#13;<br /><br />Here's an example:...&#13;<br /><span style="font-style: italic">&lt;&lt;screenshot removed&gt;&gt;</span>&#13;<br /><br /><br />Thanks!&#13;<br />satch</div>]]></body></post><post id="p16624" date="Posted: Mon Dec 15, 2003 7:54 pm "><author>Burrito</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Hi satchmo,&#13;<br /><br />welcome to the board.

I hope it´s self-explanatory. And you guys just LOVE anything that looks like a ascii-script, right? ;-D<br /><br />Sorry for the shitty specular lighting... it´s difficult to do that in a optically correct way with 4 texture units and using no NV or ATI extension. I´ll either add a codepath for NV_register_combiner extension, or add support for 8 texture units, or I´ll go all the way to ARB_fragment_program.<br /><br />The framerate is not good, I know, but this is not optimized yet. And I don´t have any assembly language inner loops, not to mention MMX/SSE stuff. And it doesn´t use vertex programs (yet), so all the math is done by the CPU. <br />And the framerate used to be twice as high, until I had to restructure the tangent space calculation because of the symmetry seam issue.<br /><br />There was so much more that I wanted to mention about the program, but let´s do it the other way round, just ask questions of what you want to know. I´m switching to lazy mode now. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />der_ton</div>

						<div class="postbody">yes I know that when you let the animation run backwards, at some point the absolute animation time becomes negative, and the animation time is clamped to 0.&#13;<br />I thought that that´s the most reasonable behaviour for the animation.&#13;<br /><br />Yes I know, the font rendering is really poopy... <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />  But I didn´t really want to concentrate on that boring stuff too much, so I chose to get some example code from some tutorial and if it works I won´t touch it.&#13;<br /><br /><br />So has anyone tried it out with the Doom3 Models? Don´t forget to set the path variable in the scene.txt file to your D3-base-directory.&#13;<br /><br />And then you can try setting the nummodels to 7 (was 5 in the original scene.txt). Maybe you´ve noticed that the scene.txt contains two more models, #5 and #6, that have been ignored. That´s kind of an easter egg... lol.</div>

How do you switch the object in focus?</div>&#13;<br /><br />Sorry, no focus switching yet...&#13;<br /><br />Sorry, the problem with pinky is very simple to solve.&#13;<br />For pinky´s "modelname" attribute in the scene file, use "maps\fred\bathroom/scene1pinkymesh.md5mesh"&#13;<br /><br />The background for the sidenote that I wrote into the scene.txt is that pinky´s texture cannot be found in all the other pinky meshes that exist in the alpha, only this scene1pinkymesh.md5mesh works. That´s because the texture name in the meshfile is "wrong" for all the other pinky-meshes. Doom3 doesn´t care about that texture name since it reads the mtr file to see what textures to use for pinky, but my viewer doesn´t bother looking up the mtr file but tries to find the texture that´s written there in the mesh.&#13;<br /><br />I found out that there´s a pinky mesh with the correct texture name just now, sorry. I always used a edited version of one of the other pinky-meshes.&#13;<br /><br />By the way, if you want to see the scene with the two security guys and the scientist that bumps into one of them, put this into your scene.txt (instead of all the other modelstuff there):&#13;<br /><br />nummodels 3 &#13;<br /><br />model 0&#13;<br />modelname "models\md5\meshes/scientist1.md5mesh"&#13;<br />modelanim "models\md5\anims\cinematics/cin_lobby_sci.md5anim"&#13;<br />modelpos 195.791 -102.819 0&#13;<br /><br />model 1&#13;<br />modelname "models\md5\meshes/security.md5mesh"&#13;<br />modelanim "models\md5\anims\cinematics/cin_lobby_sec1.md5anim"&#13;<br />modelpos -145.609 193.743 0&#13;<br /><br />model 2&#13;<br />modelname "models\md5\meshes/security.md5mesh"&#13;<br />modelanim "models\md5\anims\cinematics/cin_lobby_sec2.md5anim"&#13;<br />modelangle 0&#13;<br />modelpos 219.212 36.194 0</div>

						<div class="postbody">You know what would be real nice is if you could change the models/animations being rendered without editing the scene.txt. Perhaps a shortcut key to bring up a browse window for the model in focus which allows you to select a md5 model or animation. Then the selected model or animation would replace the model or animation in focus.&#13;<br /><br />It's still a great piece of software der_ton. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>

						<div class="postbody">Thank you guys for all the feedback. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />First of all, don´t use paths with spaces in them. Not even if you put the pathnames in " " ...&#13;<br /><br />In the included scene.txt, you can just make two changes and you´ll see pinky breaking through the walls (if you have the alpha ofcourse):&#13;<br />- change the first line that says <span style="font-weight: bold">basepath</span>, to point to the base dir of the alpha.&#13;<br />- change the line that says "nummodels 3" to "nummodels 5". The models number 3 and 4 (count starts at zero so it´s 5 models then) are pinky and the wall. The other models (number 0, 1 and 2) will still be there.&#13;<br />Yeah this is inconvenient, it would be easier to handle if the numbers were just left out and all the models in the scene.txt would be read. Ofcourse the best thing would be on the fly model loading like rich pointed out.&#13;<br /><br />matt, what exactly do you mean with the "skinless" pinky? is it white, completely without textures?</div>

						<div class="postbody">That's a great little app der_ton, very impressive - definitely the best one I've seen so far. I'm trying a similar normal-mapped app myself, and since I got the doom3 models &amp; normal maps I figured I'd use them to learn how to do it. So I have a few technical questions if you don't mind! (that is if you still hang around here..)&#13;<br /><br />Are you using tangent-space bump-mapping? This is what I've been trying, but I haven't been having too much success. I'm using a vertex program to set it up, and then register combiners to do the dot product. However it all seems to be far too bright, compared with just standard opengl lighting. Also, the diffuse map seems to be very washed out - the model doesn't show up half the detail that should be there. I know this is a little vague, and if you're willing to answer a few questions I'll go into greater detail, but I just thought you might have come across the same sort of problems as me, and might be able to point me in the right direction!&#13;<br /><br />I'm not doing specular yet, since once I have this figured out then it shouldnt be too hard to extend it to include a gloss map. And I'm not using the height map texture either, just the base texture map and the normal map - would this be something to do with my problems?&#13;<br /><br />Here's an example:...&#13;<br /><span style="font-style: italic">&lt;&lt;screenshot removed&gt;&gt;</span>&#13;<br /><br /><br />Thanks!&#13;<br />satch</div>

I hope it´s self-explanatory. And you guys just LOVE anything that looks like a ascii-script, right? ;-D<br /><br />Sorry for the shitty specular lighting... it´s difficult to do that in a optically correct way with 4 texture units and using no NV or ATI extension. I´ll either add a codepath for NV_register_combiner extension, or add support for 8 texture units, or I´ll go all the way to ARB_fragment_program.<br /><br />The framerate is not good, I know, but this is not optimized yet. And I don´t have any assembly language inner loops, not to mention MMX/SSE stuff. And it doesn´t use vertex programs (yet), so all the math is done by the CPU. <br />And the framerate used to be twice as high, until I had to restructure the tangent space calculation because of the symmetry seam issue.<br /><br />There was so much more that I wanted to mention about the program, but let´s do it the other way round, just ask questions of what you want to know. I´m switching to lazy mode now. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />der_ton</div>]]></body></post><post id="p11105" date="Posted: Thu Aug 07, 2003 7:50 am "><author>_shank</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">neat...dont know much bout it...but just appreciating the effort u put in

<br /><br />And then you can try setting the nummodels to 7 (was 5 in the original scene.txt). Maybe you´ve noticed that the scene.txt contains two more models, #5 and #6, that have been ignored.

<br /><br />Sorry, no focus switching yet...
<br /><br />Sorry, the problem with pinky is very simple to solve.
<br />For pinky´s "modelname" attribute in the scene file, use "maps\fred\bathroom/scene1pinkymesh.md5mesh"
<br /><br />The background for the sidenote that I wrote into the scene.txt is that pinky´s texture cannot be found in all the other pinky meshes that exist in the alpha, only this scene1pinkymesh.md5mesh works. That´s because the texture name in the meshfile is "wrong" for all the other pinky-meshes. Doom3 doesn´t care about that texture name since it reads the mtr file to see what textures to use for pinky, but my viewer doesn´t bother looking up the mtr file but tries to find the texture that´s written there in the mesh.
<br /><br />I found out that there´s a pinky mesh with the correct texture name just now, sorry. I always used a edited version of one of the other pinky-meshes.
<br /><br />By the way, if you want to see the scene with the two security guys and the scientist that bumps into one of them, put this into your scene.txt (instead of all the other modelstuff there):
<br /><br />nummodels 3 
<br /><br />model 0
<br />modelname "models\md5\meshes/scientist1.md5mesh"
<br />modelanim "models\md5\anims\cinematics/cin_lobby_sci.md5anim"
<br />modelpos 195.791 -102.819 0

Not even if you put the pathnames in " " ...
<br /><br />In the included scene.txt, you can just make two changes and you´ll see pinky breaking through the walls (if you have the alpha ofcourse):
<br />- change the first line that says <span style="font-weight: bold">basepath</span>, to point to the base dir of the alpha.
<br />- change the line that says "nummodels 3" to "nummodels 5". The models number 3 and 4 (count starts at zero so it´s 5 models then) are pinky and the wall. The other models (number 0, 1 and 2) will still be there.
<br />Yeah this is inconvenient, it would be easier to handle if the numbers were just left out and all the models in the scene.txt would be read. Ofcourse the best thing would be on the fly model loading like rich pointed out.

I'm trying a similar normal-mapped app myself, and since I got the doom3 models &amp; normal maps I figured I'd use them to learn how to do it. So I have a few technical questions if you don't mind! (that is if you still hang around here..)
<br /><br />Are you using tangent-space bump-mapping? This is what I've been trying, but I haven't been having too much success. I'm using a vertex program to set it up, and then register combiners to do the dot product. However it all seems to be far too bright, compared with just standard opengl lighting. Also, the diffuse map seems to be very washed out - the model doesn't show up half the detail that should be there. I know this is a little vague, and if you're willing to answer a few questions I'll go into greater detail, but I just thought you might have come across the same sort of problems as me, and might be able to point me in the right direction!
<br /><br />I'm not doing specular yet, since once I have this figured out then it shouldnt be too hard to extend it to include a gloss map. And I'm not using the height map texture either, just the base texture map and the normal map - would this be something to do with my problems?

I hope it´s self-explanatory. And you guys just LOVE anything that looks like a ascii-script, right? ;-D<br /><br />Sorry for the shitty specular lighting... it´s difficult to do that in a optically correct way with 4 texture units and using no NV or ATI extension. I´ll either add a codepath for NV_register_combiner extension, or add support for 8 texture units, or I´ll go all the way to ARB_fragment_program.<br /><br />The framerate is not good, I know, but this is not optimized yet. And I don´t have any assembly language inner loops, not to mention MMX/SSE stuff. And it doesn´t use vertex programs (yet), so all the math is done by the CPU. <br />And the framerate used to be twice as high, until I had to restructure the tangent space calculation because of the symmetry seam issue.<br /><br />There was so much more that I wanted to mention about the program, but let´s do it the other way round, just ask questions of what you want to know.

<br /><br /><br />So has anyone tried it out with the Doom3 Models? Don´t forget to set the path variable in the scene.txt file to your D3-base-directory.
<br /><br />And then you can try setting the nummodels to 7 (was 5 in the original scene.txt). Maybe you´ve noticed that the scene.txt contains two more models, #5 and #6, that have been ignored.

<br /><br />Sorry, no focus switching yet...
<br /><br />Sorry, the problem with pinky is very simple to solve.
<br />For pinky´s "modelname" attribute in the scene file, use "maps\fred\bathroom/scene1pinkymesh.md5mesh"
<br /><br />The background for the sidenote that I wrote into the scene.txt is that pinky´s texture cannot be found in all the other pinky meshes that exist in the alpha, only this scene1pinkymesh.md5mesh works. That´s because the texture name in the meshfile is "wrong" for all the other pinky-meshes. Doom3 doesn´t care about that texture name since it reads the mtr file to see what textures to use for pinky, but my viewer doesn´t bother looking up the mtr file but tries to find the texture that´s written there in the mesh.
<br /><br />I found out that there´s a pinky mesh with the correct texture name just now, sorry. I always used a edited version of one of the other pinky-meshes.
<br /><br />By the way, if you want to see the scene with the two security guys and the scientist that bumps into one of them, put this into your scene.txt (instead of all the other modelstuff there):
<br /><br />nummodels 3 
<br /><br />model 0
<br />modelname "models\md5\meshes/scientist1.md5mesh"
<br />modelanim "models\md5\anims\cinematics/cin_lobby_sci.md5anim"
<br />modelpos 195.791 -102.819 0

I hope it´s self-explanatory. And you guys just LOVE anything that looks like a ascii-script, right? ;-D<br /><br />Sorry for the shitty specular lighting... it´s difficult to do that in a optically correct way with 4 texture units and using no NV or ATI extension. I´ll either add a codepath for NV_register_combiner extension, or add support for 8 texture units, or I´ll go all the way to ARB_fragment_program.<br /><br />The framerate is not good, I know, but this is not optimized yet. And I don´t have any assembly language inner loops, not to mention MMX/SSE stuff. And it doesn´t use vertex programs (yet), so all the math is done by the CPU. <br />And the framerate used to be twice as high, until I had to restructure the tangent space calculation because of the symmetry seam issue.<br /><br />There was so much more that I wanted to mention about the program, but let´s do it the other way round, just ask questions of what you want to know.

<br /><br />And then you can try setting the nummodels to 7 (was 5 in the original scene.txt). Maybe you´ve noticed that the scene.txt contains two more models, #5 and #6, that have been ignored.

<br /><br />Sorry, no focus switching yet...
<br /><br />Sorry, the problem with pinky is very simple to solve.
<br />For pinky´s "modelname" attribute in the scene file, use "maps\fred\bathroom/scene1pinkymesh.md5mesh"
<br /><br />The background for the sidenote that I wrote into the scene.txt is that pinky´s texture cannot be found in all the other pinky meshes that exist in the alpha, only this scene1pinkymesh.md5mesh works. That´s because the texture name in the meshfile is "wrong" for all the other pinky-meshes. Doom3 doesn´t care about that texture name since it reads the mtr file to see what textures to use for pinky, but my viewer doesn´t bother looking up the mtr file but tries to find the texture that´s written there in the mesh.
<br /><br />I found out that there´s a pinky mesh with the correct texture name just now, sorry. I always used a edited version of one of the other pinky-meshes.
<br /><br />By the way, if you want to see the scene with the two security guys and the scientist that bumps into one of them, put this into your scene.txt (instead of all the other modelstuff there):
<br /><br />nummodels 3 
<br /><br />model 0
<br />modelname "models\md5\meshes/scientist1.md5mesh"
<br />modelanim "models\md5\anims\cinematics/cin_lobby_sci.md5anim"
<br />modelpos 195.791 -102.819 0
<br /><br />model 1

Not even if you put the pathnames in " " ...
<br /><br />In the included scene.txt, you can just make two changes and you´ll see pinky breaking through the walls (if you have the alpha ofcourse):
<br />- change the first line that says <span style="font-weight: bold">basepath</span>, to point to the base dir of the alpha.
<br />- change the line that says "nummodels 3" to "nummodels 5". The models number 3 and 4 (count starts at zero so it´s 5 models then) are pinky and the wall. The other models (number 0, 1 and 2) will still be there.
<br />Yeah this is inconvenient, it would be easier to handle if the numbers were just left out and all the models in the scene.txt would be read. Ofcourse the best thing would be on the fly model loading like rich pointed out.

I'm trying a similar normal-mapped app myself, and since I got the doom3 models &amp; normal maps I figured I'd use them to learn how to do it. So I have a few technical questions if you don't mind! (that is if you still hang around here..)
<br /><br />Are you using tangent-space bump-mapping? This is what I've been trying, but I haven't been having too much success. I'm using a vertex program to set it up, and then register combiners to do the dot product. However it all seems to be far too bright, compared with just standard opengl lighting. Also, the diffuse map seems to be very washed out - the model doesn't show up half the detail that should be there. I know this is a little vague, and if you're willing to answer a few questions I'll go into greater detail, but I just thought you might have come across the same sort of problems as me, and might be able to point me in the right direction!
<br /><br />I'm not doing specular yet, since once I have this figured out then it shouldnt be too hard to extend it to include a gloss map. And I'm not using the height map texture either, just the base texture map and the normal map - would this be something to do with my problems?
<br /><br />Here's an example:...

<br />About projected spotlights, just bind it in 4th texUnit

<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">tex#1</span>: Cubemap for NormalMap
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">tex#2</span>: Diffusemap (then Specularmap at second pass)

<br />Need more twice pass as above. 
<br />tex#0,#1 at first pass to alpha-buffer
<br />tex#2,#3 at second pass to blend with alpha-buffer.
<br />Then do again for specularmap
<br /><br />About Cull, sure! Mesh would be culled if outside light's frustum or outside camera's frustum.
<br /><br />I also have many improvement to do in the future. Such as:
<br />a. use fragment program to do single pass(w/diffuse, specular) per light

When it looks deformed, I guess that the UV layouts of the texture and the model don't match.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">rich_is_bored wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Smoothing doesn't appear to be working on *.LWO models where as it does in Doom 3.</div>
<br />Can you tell me which LWO, and maybe take a screenshot?

<br /><br />I'll send it VIA email.
<br /><br />Just keep in mind that the model has a dummy shader name.

<br /><br />There is a material named "models/characters/player/body2" that references the same textures as the shader "models/characters/player/body" material, and these textures are the files "models/characters/player/body.tga", "..._local.tga" and so on.

<br /><br />I have to suggest some new features for der_ton model viewer to improve a better workflow when you work with it.
<br /><br />*  priority
<br />** secondary 
<br /><br />-=Workflow=-
<br /><br />*
<br />- Read config model in def files for quick navigation between model's sequences. 
<br />- Display names of bones in a short list dialog to select bones and highlightning the bone selected in viewport's model viewer, i suggest a new tab called Bones. 
<br /><br />**
<br />- Move to player view for better preview weapons animation.
<br /><br /><br />-=Render=-
<br /><br />*
<br />- Sketch render (uniform lightning) like this : 
<br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://redeye.free.fr/sketch_view.jpg" alt="Image" /><br />- Hide geometry for better understanding rigging model (bones only)
<br /><br />**
<br />- Display influence Bones (weight map)
<br /><br /><br />-=Textures=-
<br /><br />**
<br />- New Materials tab to display model's texture on model viewer viewport.
<br /><br /><br />If you have any other suggest for improve model viewer you can post it here =)
<br /><br />Bye!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p114647" date="Posted: Sun Oct 02, 2005 2:03 am "><author>Yak</author><body><![CDATA[<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>

						<div class="postbody">Hi, I also write a md5mesh viewer at
<br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.geocities.com/macbearchen/data/md5mesh_macbear.zip" class="postlink">md5mesh_macbear.zip</a>
<br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.geocities.com/macbearchen/data/md5mesh.jpg" alt="Image" /><br />The program is use to demo the bumpmap, perpixel lighting via real-time 3D graphics
<br /><br />=== 3D Graphics technology ===
<br />1. shadow-volume
<br />2. many dynamic lights, and single ambient light
<br />3. bumpmap with diffuse and specular map
<br />4. Support 3D model by md5mesh format (used in DOOM3), and md5anim animation file
<br />5. Support 3D model by ASE format (3DSMAX ASE file export)
<br /><br />=== System requirement ===
<br />* Windows XP/2000/98/ME Traditional Chinese with OpenGL 1.3 ICD
<br />* 3D card:
<br />     nVidia Geforce Card from Geforce/Geforce2/2MX/3Ti/4200Ti or later
<br />     ATi Radeon 7x00/8500/9x00 or later
<br />-----------------------------------------
<br />I use some render-path for different Graphics cards:
<br /><span style="font-style: italic">2 texture-units card: use alpha buffer to temporary store bumpmap, then blend with diffuse and do specular pass</span>
<br /><span style="font-style: italic">4 texture-units card: render-path for specular pass via ATi and nVidia</span>
<br /><br />I read many useful posts here, and write the program.
<br />Any comment is welcome.
<br /><br />ps: The file is located on geocities, data transfer quota is limited.
<br />     So if you can't download it right now, try again later. Sorry...</div>

<br />And it's a bit faster than my viewer. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br />About the system requirements: it worked for me even though I don't have a Traditional Chinese Windows.

<br />About projected spotlights, just bind it in 4th texUnit
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">tex#0</span>: NormalMap
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">tex#1</span>: Cubemap for NormalMap
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">tex#2</span>: Diffusemap (then Specularmap at second pass)
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">tex#3</span>: 2D Spotlights map (3D tex is workable if you care about vertical attenuation by light)
<br />For 2 texUnits card:
<br />Need more twice pass as above. 
<br />tex#0,#1 at first pass to alpha-buffer
<br />tex#2,#3 at second pass to blend with alpha-buffer.
<br />Then do again for specularmap
<br /><br />About Cull, sure! Mesh would be culled if outside light's frustum or outside camera's frustum.
<br /><br />I also have many improvement to do in the future. Such as:
<br />a. use fragment program to do single pass(w/diffuse, specular) per light 
<br />b. use two-side stencil (UltraShadow via nVidia)
<br />c. use vertex program
<br />d. etc...</div>

						<div class="postbody">Doom3 uses a material system to get the correct look and the location of the texture files. My viewer doesn't, for simplicity's sake.
<br /><br />You will have to extract the textures from pak002.pk4, and then edit the "shader" lines in a .md5mesh file to point directly to the correct textures.
<br /><br />There are a couple of explanations on page 4 of this thread, too. I hope that helps.</div>

						<div class="postbody">Hi all!
<br /><br />I have to suggest some new features for der_ton model viewer to improve a better workflow when you work with it.
<br /><br />*  priority
<br />** secondary 
<br /><br />-=Workflow=-
<br /><br />*
<br />- Read config model in def files for quick navigation between model's sequences. 
<br />- Display names of bones in a short list dialog to select bones and highlightning the bone selected in viewport's model viewer, i suggest a new tab called Bones. 
<br /><br />**
<br />- Move to player view for better preview weapons animation.
<br /><br /><br />-=Render=-
<br /><br />*
<br />- Sketch render (uniform lightning) like this : 
<br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://redeye.free.fr/sketch_view.jpg" alt="Image" /><br />- Hide geometry for better understanding rigging model (bones only)
<br /><br />**
<br />- Display influence Bones (weight map)
<br /><br /><br />-=Textures=-
<br /><br />**
<br />- New Materials tab to display model's texture on model viewer viewport.
<br /><br /><br />If you have any other suggest for improve model viewer you can post it here =)
<br /><br />Bye!</div>

<br /><br />And then you can try setting the nummodels to 7 (was 5 in the original scene.txt). Maybe you´ve noticed that the scene.txt contains two more models, #5 and #6, that have been ignored.

<br /><br />Sorry, no focus switching yet...
<br /><br />Sorry, the problem with pinky is very simple to solve.
<br />For pinky´s "modelname" attribute in the scene file, use "maps\fred\bathroom/scene1pinkymesh.md5mesh"
<br /><br />The background for the sidenote that I wrote into the scene.txt is that pinky´s texture cannot be found in all the other pinky meshes that exist in the alpha, only this scene1pinkymesh.md5mesh works. That´s because the texture name in the meshfile is "wrong" for all the other pinky-meshes. Doom3 doesn´t care about that texture name since it reads the mtr file to see what textures to use for pinky, but my viewer doesn´t bother looking up the mtr file but tries to find the texture that´s written there in the mesh.
<br /><br />I found out that there´s a pinky mesh with the correct texture name just now, sorry. I always used a edited version of one of the other pinky-meshes.
<br /><br />By the way, if you want to see the scene with the two security guys and the scientist that bumps into one of them, put this into your scene.txt (instead of all the other modelstuff there):
<br /><br />nummodels 3 
<br /><br />model 0
<br />modelname "models\md5\meshes/scientist1.md5mesh"
<br />modelanim "models\md5\anims\cinematics/cin_lobby_sci.md5anim"
<br />modelpos 195.791 -102.819 0
<br /><br />model 1

Not even if you put the pathnames in " " ...
<br /><br />In the included scene.txt, you can just make two changes and you´ll see pinky breaking through the walls (if you have the alpha ofcourse):
<br />- change the first line that says <span style="font-weight: bold">basepath</span>, to point to the base dir of the alpha.
<br />- change the line that says "nummodels 3" to "nummodels 5". The models number 3 and 4 (count starts at zero so it´s 5 models then) are pinky and the wall. The other models (number 0, 1 and 2) will still be there.
<br />Yeah this is inconvenient, it would be easier to handle if the numbers were just left out and all the models in the scene.txt would be read. Ofcourse the best thing would be on the fly model loading like rich pointed out.

I'm trying a similar normal-mapped app myself, and since I got the doom3 models &amp; normal maps I figured I'd use them to learn how to do it. So I have a few technical questions if you don't mind! (that is if you still hang around here..)
<br /><br />Are you using tangent-space bump-mapping? This is what I've been trying, but I haven't been having too much success. I'm using a vertex program to set it up, and then register combiners to do the dot product. However it all seems to be far too bright, compared with just standard opengl lighting. Also, the diffuse map seems to be very washed out - the model doesn't show up half the detail that should be there. I know this is a little vague, and if you're willing to answer a few questions I'll go into greater detail, but I just thought you might have come across the same sort of problems as me, and might be able to point me in the right direction!
<br /><br />I'm not doing specular yet, since once I have this figured out then it shouldnt be too hard to extend it to include a gloss map. And I'm not using the height map texture either, just the base texture map and the normal map - would this be something to do with my problems?
<br /><br />Here's an example:...

<br /><br />Sorry, no focus switching yet...
<br /><br />Sorry, the problem with pinky is very simple to solve.
<br />For pinky´s "modelname" attribute in the scene file, use "maps\fred\bathroom/scene1pinkymesh.md5mesh"
<br /><br />The background for the sidenote that I wrote into the scene.txt is that pinky´s texture cannot be found in all the other pinky meshes that exist in the alpha, only this scene1pinkymesh.md5mesh works. That´s because the texture name in the meshfile is "wrong" for all the other pinky-meshes. Doom3 doesn´t care about that texture name since it reads the mtr file to see what textures to use for pinky, but my viewer doesn´t bother looking up the mtr file but tries to find the texture that´s written there in the mesh.
<br /><br />I found out that there´s a pinky mesh with the correct texture name just now, sorry. I always used a edited version of one of the other pinky-meshes.
<br /><br />By the way, if you want to see the scene with the two security guys and the scientist that bumps into one of them, put this into your scene.txt (instead of all the other modelstuff there):
<br /><br />nummodels 3 
<br /><br />model 0
<br />modelname "models\md5\meshes/scientist1.md5mesh"
<br />modelanim "models\md5\anims\cinematics/cin_lobby_sci.md5anim"

Not even if you put the pathnames in " " ...
<br /><br />In the included scene.txt, you can just make two changes and you´ll see pinky breaking through the walls (if you have the alpha ofcourse):
<br />- change the first line that says <span style="font-weight: bold">basepath</span>, to point to the base dir of the alpha.
<br />- change the line that says "nummodels 3" to "nummodels 5". The models number 3 and 4 (count starts at zero so it´s 5 models then) are pinky and the wall. The other models (number 0, 1 and 2) will still be there.
<br />Yeah this is inconvenient, it would be easier to handle if the numbers were just left out and all the models in the scene.txt would be read. Ofcourse the best thing would be on the fly model loading like rich pointed out.
<br /><br />matt, what exactly do you mean with the "skinless" pinky? is it white, completely without textures?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p14409" date="Posted: Fri Oct 17, 2003 10:52 pm "><author>rich_is_bored</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Oh, I just had another idea.

I'm trying a similar normal-mapped app myself, and since I got the doom3 models &amp; normal maps I figured I'd use them to learn how to do it. So I have a few technical questions if you don't mind! (that is if you still hang around here..)
<br /><br />Are you using tangent-space bump-mapping? This is what I've been trying, but I haven't been having too much success. I'm using a vertex program to set it up, and then register combiners to do the dot product. However it all seems to be far too bright, compared with just standard opengl lighting. Also, the diffuse map seems to be very washed out - the model doesn't show up half the detail that should be there. I know this is a little vague, and if you're willing to answer a few questions I'll go into greater detail, but I just thought you might have come across the same sort of problems as me, and might be able to point me in the right direction!
<br /><br />I'm not doing specular yet, since once I have this figured out then it shouldnt be too hard to extend it to include a gloss map. And I'm not using the height map texture either, just the base texture map and the normal map - would this be something to do with my problems?
<br /><br />Here's an example:...

I always used a edited version of one of the other pinky-meshes.&#13;<br /><br />By the way, if you want to see the scene with the two security guys and the scientist that bumps into one of them, put this into your scene.txt (instead of all the other modelstuff there):&#13;<br /><br />nummodels 3 &#13;<br /><br />model 0&#13;<br />modelname "models\md5\meshes/scientist1.md5mesh"&#13;<br />modelanim "models\md5\anims\cinematics/cin_lobby_sci.md5anim"&#13;<br />modelpos 195.791 -102.819 0&#13;<br /><br />model 1&#13;<br />modelname "models\md5\meshes/security.md5mesh"&#13;<br />modelanim "models\md5\anims\cinematics/cin_lobby_sec1.md5anim"&#13;<br />modelpos -145.609 193.743 0&#13;<br /><br />model 2&#13;<br />modelname "models\md5\meshes/security.md5mesh"&#13;<br />modelanim "models\md5\anims\cinematics/cin_lobby_sec2.md5anim"&#13;<br />modelangle 0&#13;<br />modelpos 219.212 36.194 0</div>]]></body></post><post id="p14299" date="Posted: Thu Oct 16, 2003 12:18 am "><author>der_ton</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">There´s a new version,&#13;<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/doom3/der_ton/modelviewer.zip">http://www.doom3world.org/doom3/der_ton/modelviewer.zip</a><!-- m -->&#13;<br /><br />-improved specular lighting on Geforce3+&#13;<br />-switch the object in focus (thanks rich)&#13;<br />-improved flexibility for camera movement&#13;<br />-can draw character skeletons&#13;<br />-reads obj and ase models, too&#13;<br /><br />Nothing stunning, but I felt like improving it a little more. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p14308" date="Posted: Thu Oct 16, 2003 2:30 am "><author>kat</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">downloaded for a looksee..</div>]]></body></post><post id="p14309" date="Posted: Thu Oct 16, 2003 4:00 am "><author>rich_is_bored</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">You know what would be real nice is if you could change the models/animations being rendered without editing the scene.txt. Perhaps a shortcut key to bring up a browse window for the model in focus which allows you to select a md5 model or animation.

Not even if you put the pathnames in " " ...&#13;<br /><br />In the included scene.txt, you can just make two changes and you´ll see pinky breaking through the walls (if you have the alpha ofcourse):&#13;<br />- change the first line that says <span style="font-weight: bold">basepath</span>, to point to the base dir of the alpha.&#13;<br />- change the line that says "nummodels 3" to "nummodels 5". The models number 3 and 4 (count starts at zero so it´s 5 models then) are pinky and the wall. The other models (number 0, 1 and 2) will still be there.&#13;<br />Yeah this is inconvenient, it would be easier to handle if the numbers were just left out and all the models in the scene.txt would be read. Ofcourse the best thing would be on the fly model loading like rich pointed out.&#13;<br /><br />matt, what exactly do you mean with the "skinless" pinky? is it white, completely without textures?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p14409" date="Posted: Fri Oct 17, 2003 10:52 pm "><author>rich_is_bored</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Oh, I just had another idea.

I'm trying a similar normal-mapped app myself, and since I got the doom3 models &amp; normal maps I figured I'd use them to learn how to do it. So I have a few technical questions if you don't mind! (that is if you still hang around here..)&#13;<br /><br />Are you using tangent-space bump-mapping? This is what I've been trying, but I haven't been having too much success. I'm using a vertex program to set it up, and then register combiners to do the dot product. However it all seems to be far too bright, compared with just standard opengl lighting. Also, the diffuse map seems to be very washed out - the model doesn't show up half the detail that should be there. I know this is a little vague, and if you're willing to answer a few questions I'll go into greater detail, but I just thought you might have come across the same sort of problems as me, and might be able to point me in the right direction!&#13;<br /><br />I'm not doing specular yet, since once I have this figured out then it shouldnt be too hard to extend it to include a gloss map. And I'm not using the height map texture either, just the base texture map and the normal map - would this be something to do with my problems?&#13;<br /><br />Here's an example:...&#13;<br /><span style="font-style: italic">&lt;&lt;screenshot removed&gt;&gt;</span>&#13;<br /><br /><br />Thanks!&#13;<br />satch</div>]]></body></post><post id="p16624" date="Posted: Mon Dec 15, 2003 7:54 pm "><author>Burrito</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Hi satchmo,&#13;<br /><br />welcome to the board.

I hope it´s self-explanatory. And you guys just LOVE anything that looks like a ascii-script, right? ;-D<br /><br />Sorry for the shitty specular lighting... it´s difficult to do that in a optically correct way with 4 texture units and using no NV or ATI extension. I´ll either add a codepath for NV_register_combiner extension, or add support for 8 texture units, or I´ll go all the way to ARB_fragment_program.<br /><br />The framerate is not good, I know, but this is not optimized yet. And I don´t have any assembly language inner loops, not to mention MMX/SSE stuff. And it doesn´t use vertex programs (yet), so all the math is done by the CPU. <br />And the framerate used to be twice as high, until I had to restructure the tangent space calculation because of the symmetry seam issue.<br /><br />There was so much more that I wanted to mention about the program, but let´s do it the other way round, just ask questions of what you want to know. I´m switching to lazy mode now. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />der_ton</div>

						<div class="postbody">yes I know that when you let the animation run backwards, at some point the absolute animation time becomes negative, and the animation time is clamped to 0.&#13;<br />I thought that that´s the most reasonable behaviour for the animation.&#13;<br /><br />Yes I know, the font rendering is really poopy... <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />  But I didn´t really want to concentrate on that boring stuff too much, so I chose to get some example code from some tutorial and if it works I won´t touch it.&#13;<br /><br /><br />So has anyone tried it out with the Doom3 Models? Don´t forget to set the path variable in the scene.txt file to your D3-base-directory.&#13;<br /><br />And then you can try setting the nummodels to 7 (was 5 in the original scene.txt). Maybe you´ve noticed that the scene.txt contains two more models, #5 and #6, that have been ignored. That´s kind of an easter egg... lol.</div>

How do you switch the object in focus?</div>&#13;<br /><br />Sorry, no focus switching yet...&#13;<br /><br />Sorry, the problem with pinky is very simple to solve.&#13;<br />For pinky´s "modelname" attribute in the scene file, use "maps\fred\bathroom/scene1pinkymesh.md5mesh"&#13;<br /><br />The background for the sidenote that I wrote into the scene.txt is that pinky´s texture cannot be found in all the other pinky meshes that exist in the alpha, only this scene1pinkymesh.md5mesh works. That´s because the texture name in the meshfile is "wrong" for all the other pinky-meshes. Doom3 doesn´t care about that texture name since it reads the mtr file to see what textures to use for pinky, but my viewer doesn´t bother looking up the mtr file but tries to find the texture that´s written there in the mesh.&#13;<br /><br />I found out that there´s a pinky mesh with the correct texture name just now, sorry. I always used a edited version of one of the other pinky-meshes.&#13;<br /><br />By the way, if you want to see the scene with the two security guys and the scientist that bumps into one of them, put this into your scene.txt (instead of all the other modelstuff there):&#13;<br /><br />nummodels 3 &#13;<br /><br />model 0&#13;<br />modelname "models\md5\meshes/scientist1.md5mesh"&#13;<br />modelanim "models\md5\anims\cinematics/cin_lobby_sci.md5anim"&#13;<br />modelpos 195.791 -102.819 0&#13;<br /><br />model 1&#13;<br />modelname "models\md5\meshes/security.md5mesh"&#13;<br />modelanim "models\md5\anims\cinematics/cin_lobby_sec1.md5anim"&#13;<br />modelpos -145.609 193.743 0&#13;<br /><br />model 2&#13;<br />modelname "models\md5\meshes/security.md5mesh"&#13;<br />modelanim "models\md5\anims\cinematics/cin_lobby_sec2.md5anim"&#13;<br />modelangle 0&#13;<br />modelpos 219.212 36.194 0</div>

						<div class="postbody">You know what would be real nice is if you could change the models/animations being rendered without editing the scene.txt. Perhaps a shortcut key to bring up a browse window for the model in focus which allows you to select a md5 model or animation. Then the selected model or animation would replace the model or animation in focus.&#13;<br /><br />It's still a great piece of software der_ton. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>

						<div class="postbody">Thank you guys for all the feedback. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />First of all, don´t use paths with spaces in them. Not even if you put the pathnames in " " ...&#13;<br /><br />In the included scene.txt, you can just make two changes and you´ll see pinky breaking through the walls (if you have the alpha ofcourse):&#13;<br />- change the first line that says <span style="font-weight: bold">basepath</span>, to point to the base dir of the alpha.&#13;<br />- change the line that says "nummodels 3" to "nummodels 5". The models number 3 and 4 (count starts at zero so it´s 5 models then) are pinky and the wall. The other models (number 0, 1 and 2) will still be there.&#13;<br />Yeah this is inconvenient, it would be easier to handle if the numbers were just left out and all the models in the scene.txt would be read. Ofcourse the best thing would be on the fly model loading like rich pointed out.&#13;<br /><br />matt, what exactly do you mean with the "skinless" pinky? is it white, completely without textures?</div>

						<div class="postbody">That's a great little app der_ton, very impressive - definitely the best one I've seen so far. I'm trying a similar normal-mapped app myself, and since I got the doom3 models &amp; normal maps I figured I'd use them to learn how to do it. So I have a few technical questions if you don't mind! (that is if you still hang around here..)&#13;<br /><br />Are you using tangent-space bump-mapping? This is what I've been trying, but I haven't been having too much success. I'm using a vertex program to set it up, and then register combiners to do the dot product. However it all seems to be far too bright, compared with just standard opengl lighting. Also, the diffuse map seems to be very washed out - the model doesn't show up half the detail that should be there. I know this is a little vague, and if you're willing to answer a few questions I'll go into greater detail, but I just thought you might have come across the same sort of problems as me, and might be able to point me in the right direction!&#13;<br /><br />I'm not doing specular yet, since once I have this figured out then it shouldnt be too hard to extend it to include a gloss map. And I'm not using the height map texture either, just the base texture map and the normal map - would this be something to do with my problems?&#13;<br /><br />Here's an example:...&#13;<br /><span style="font-style: italic">&lt;&lt;screenshot removed&gt;&gt;</span>&#13;<br /><br /><br />Thanks!&#13;<br />satch</div>

I hope it´s self-explanatory. And you guys just LOVE anything that looks like a ascii-script, right? ;-D<br /><br />Sorry for the shitty specular lighting... it´s difficult to do that in a optically correct way with 4 texture units and using no NV or ATI extension. I´ll either add a codepath for NV_register_combiner extension, or add support for 8 texture units, or I´ll go all the way to ARB_fragment_program.<br /><br />The framerate is not good, I know, but this is not optimized yet. And I don´t have any assembly language inner loops, not to mention MMX/SSE stuff. And it doesn´t use vertex programs (yet), so all the math is done by the CPU. <br />And the framerate used to be twice as high, until I had to restructure the tangent space calculation because of the symmetry seam issue.<br /><br />There was so much more that I wanted to mention about the program, but let´s do it the other way round, just ask questions of what you want to know. I´m switching to lazy mode now. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />der_ton</div>]]></body></post><post id="p11105" date="Posted: Thu Aug 07, 2003 7:50 am "><author>_shank</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">neat...dont know much bout it...but just appreciating the effort u put in

<br /><br />And then you can try setting the nummodels to 7 (was 5 in the original scene.txt). Maybe you´ve noticed that the scene.txt contains two more models, #5 and #6, that have been ignored.

<br /><br />Sorry, no focus switching yet...
<br /><br />Sorry, the problem with pinky is very simple to solve.
<br />For pinky´s "modelname" attribute in the scene file, use "maps\fred\bathroom/scene1pinkymesh.md5mesh"
<br /><br />The background for the sidenote that I wrote into the scene.txt is that pinky´s texture cannot be found in all the other pinky meshes that exist in the alpha, only this scene1pinkymesh.md5mesh works. That´s because the texture name in the meshfile is "wrong" for all the other pinky-meshes. Doom3 doesn´t care about that texture name since it reads the mtr file to see what textures to use for pinky, but my viewer doesn´t bother looking up the mtr file but tries to find the texture that´s written there in the mesh.
<br /><br />I found out that there´s a pinky mesh with the correct texture name just now, sorry. I always used a edited version of one of the other pinky-meshes.
<br /><br />By the way, if you want to see the scene with the two security guys and the scientist that bumps into one of them, put this into your scene.txt (instead of all the other modelstuff there):
<br /><br />nummodels 3 
<br /><br />model 0
<br />modelname "models\md5\meshes/scientist1.md5mesh"
<br />modelanim "models\md5\anims\cinematics/cin_lobby_sci.md5anim"

Not even if you put the pathnames in " " ...
<br /><br />In the included scene.txt, you can just make two changes and you´ll see pinky breaking through the walls (if you have the alpha ofcourse):
<br />- change the first line that says <span style="font-weight: bold">basepath</span>, to point to the base dir of the alpha.
<br />- change the line that says "nummodels 3" to "nummodels 5". The models number 3 and 4 (count starts at zero so it´s 5 models then) are pinky and the wall. The other models (number 0, 1 and 2) will still be there.
<br />Yeah this is inconvenient, it would be easier to handle if the numbers were just left out and all the models in the scene.txt would be read. Ofcourse the best thing would be on the fly model loading like rich pointed out.

I'm trying a similar normal-mapped app myself, and since I got the doom3 models &amp; normal maps I figured I'd use them to learn how to do it. So I have a few technical questions if you don't mind! (that is if you still hang around here..)
<br /><br />Are you using tangent-space bump-mapping? This is what I've been trying, but I haven't been having too much success. I'm using a vertex program to set it up, and then register combiners to do the dot product. However it all seems to be far too bright, compared with just standard opengl lighting. Also, the diffuse map seems to be very washed out - the model doesn't show up half the detail that should be there. I know this is a little vague, and if you're willing to answer a few questions I'll go into greater detail, but I just thought you might have come across the same sort of problems as me, and might be able to point me in the right direction!
<br /><br />I'm not doing specular yet, since once I have this figured out then it shouldnt be too hard to extend it to include a gloss map. And I'm not using the height map texture either, just the base texture map and the normal map - would this be something to do with my problems?
<br /><br />Here's an example:...

I hope it´s self-explanatory. And you guys just LOVE anything that looks like a ascii-script, right? ;-D<br /><br />Sorry for the shitty specular lighting... it´s difficult to do that in a optically correct way with 4 texture units and using no NV or ATI extension. I´ll either add a codepath for NV_register_combiner extension, or add support for 8 texture units, or I´ll go all the way to ARB_fragment_program.<br /><br />The framerate is not good, I know, but this is not optimized yet. And I don´t have any assembly language inner loops, not to mention MMX/SSE stuff. And it doesn´t use vertex programs (yet), so all the math is done by the CPU. <br />And the framerate used to be twice as high, until I had to restructure the tangent space calculation because of the symmetry seam issue.<br /><br />There was so much more that I wanted to mention about the program, but let´s do it the other way round, just ask questions of what you want to know. I´m switching to lazy mode now. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />der_ton</div>]]></body></post><post id="p11105" date="Posted: Thu Aug 07, 2003 7:50 am "><author>_shank</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">neat...dont know much bout it...but just appreciating the effort u put in&#13;<br /><br />the butterfly stopped flapping after i did shift + x(after the initial fast flapping)</div>]]></body></post><post id="p11110" date="Posted: Thu Aug 07, 2003 9:18 am "><author>KPixel</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Really nice !&#13;<br /><br />On side note : The rendering of font (when rendering help) really kill FPS <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p11117" date="Posted: Thu Aug 07, 2003 10:48 am "><author>der_ton</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">yes I know that when you let the animation run backwards, at some point the absolute animation time becomes negative, and the animation time is clamped to 0.&#13;<br />I thought that that´s the most reasonable behaviour for the animation.&#13;<br /><br />Yes I know, the font rendering is really poopy... <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />  But I didn´t really want to concentrate on that boring stuff too much, so I chose to get some example code from some tutorial and if it works I won´t touch it.&#13;<br /><br /><br />So has anyone tried it out with the Doom3 Models?

How do you switch the object in focus?</div>&#13;<br /><br />Sorry, no focus switching yet...&#13;<br /><br />Sorry, the problem with pinky is very simple to solve.&#13;<br />For pinky´s "modelname" attribute in the scene file, use "maps\fred\bathroom/scene1pinkymesh.md5mesh"&#13;<br /><br />The background for the sidenote that I wrote into the scene.txt is that pinky´s texture cannot be found in all the other pinky meshes that exist in the alpha, only this scene1pinkymesh.md5mesh works. That´s because the texture name in the meshfile is "wrong" for all the other pinky-meshes. Doom3 doesn´t care about that texture name since it reads the mtr file to see what textures to use for pinky, but my viewer doesn´t bother looking up the mtr file but tries to find the texture that´s written there in the mesh.&#13;<br /><br />I found out that there´s a pinky mesh with the correct texture name just now, sorry. I always used a edited version of one of the other pinky-meshes.&#13;<br /><br />By the way, if you want to see the scene with the two security guys and the scientist that bumps into one of them, put this into your scene.txt (instead of all the other modelstuff there):&#13;<br /><br />nummodels 3 &#13;<br /><br />model 0&#13;<br />modelname "models\md5\meshes/scientist1.md5mesh"&#13;<br />modelanim "models\md5\anims\cinematics/cin_lobby_sci.md5anim"&#13;<br />modelpos 195.791 -102.819 0&#13;<br /><br />model 1&#13;<br />modelname "models\md5\meshes/security.md5mesh"&#13;<br />modelanim "models\md5\anims\cinematics/cin_lobby_sec1.md5anim"&#13;<br />modelpos -145.609 193.743 0&#13;<br /><br />model 2&#13;<br />modelname "models\md5\meshes/security.md5mesh"&#13;<br />modelanim "models\md5\anims\cinematics/cin_lobby_sec2.md5anim"&#13;<br />modelangle 0&#13;<br />modelpos 219.212 36.194 0</div>]]></body></post><post id="p14299" date="Posted: Thu Oct 16, 2003 12:18 am "><author>der_ton</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">There´s a new version,&#13;<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/doom3/der_ton/modelviewer.zip">http://www.doom3world.org/doom3/der_ton/modelviewer.zip</a><!-- m -->&#13;<br /><br />-improved specular lighting on Geforce3+&#13;<br />-switch the object in focus (thanks rich)&#13;<br />-improved flexibility for camera movement&#13;<br />-can draw character skeletons&#13;<br />-reads obj and ase models, too&#13;<br /><br />Nothing stunning, but I felt like improving it a little more. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p14308" date="Posted: Thu Oct 16, 2003 2:30 am "><author>kat</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">downloaded for a looksee..</div>]]></body></post><post id="p14309" date="Posted: Thu Oct 16, 2003 4:00 am "><author>rich_is_bored</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">You know what would be real nice is if you could change the models/animations being rendered without editing the scene.txt.

I hope it´s self-explanatory. And you guys just LOVE anything that looks like a ascii-script, right? ;-D<br /><br />Sorry for the shitty specular lighting... it´s difficult to do that in a optically correct way with 4 texture units and using no NV or ATI extension. I´ll either add a codepath for NV_register_combiner extension, or add support for 8 texture units, or I´ll go all the way to ARB_fragment_program.<br /><br />The framerate is not good, I know, but this is not optimized yet. And I don´t have any assembly language inner loops, not to mention MMX/SSE stuff. And it doesn´t use vertex programs (yet), so all the math is done by the CPU. <br />And the framerate used to be twice as high, until I had to restructure the tangent space calculation because of the symmetry seam issue.<br /><br />There was so much more that I wanted to mention about the program, but let´s do it the other way round, just ask questions of what you want to know. I´m switching to lazy mode now. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />der_ton</div>

						<div class="postbody">yes I know that when you let the animation run backwards, at some point the absolute animation time becomes negative, and the animation time is clamped to 0.&#13;<br />I thought that that´s the most reasonable behaviour for the animation.&#13;<br /><br />Yes I know, the font rendering is really poopy... <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />  But I didn´t really want to concentrate on that boring stuff too much, so I chose to get some example code from some tutorial and if it works I won´t touch it.&#13;<br /><br /><br />So has anyone tried it out with the Doom3 Models? Don´t forget to set the path variable in the scene.txt file to your D3-base-directory.&#13;<br /><br />And then you can try setting the nummodels to 7 (was 5 in the original scene.txt). Maybe you´ve noticed that the scene.txt contains two more models, #5 and #6, that have been ignored. That´s kind of an easter egg... lol.</div>

How do you switch the object in focus?</div>&#13;<br /><br />Sorry, no focus switching yet...&#13;<br /><br />Sorry, the problem with pinky is very simple to solve.&#13;<br />For pinky´s "modelname" attribute in the scene file, use "maps\fred\bathroom/scene1pinkymesh.md5mesh"&#13;<br /><br />The background for the sidenote that I wrote into the scene.txt is that pinky´s texture cannot be found in all the other pinky meshes that exist in the alpha, only this scene1pinkymesh.md5mesh works. That´s because the texture name in the meshfile is "wrong" for all the other pinky-meshes. Doom3 doesn´t care about that texture name since it reads the mtr file to see what textures to use for pinky, but my viewer doesn´t bother looking up the mtr file but tries to find the texture that´s written there in the mesh.&#13;<br /><br />I found out that there´s a pinky mesh with the correct texture name just now, sorry. I always used a edited version of one of the other pinky-meshes.&#13;<br /><br />By the way, if you want to see the scene with the two security guys and the scientist that bumps into one of them, put this into your scene.txt (instead of all the other modelstuff there):&#13;<br /><br />nummodels 3 &#13;<br /><br />model 0&#13;<br />modelname "models\md5\meshes/scientist1.md5mesh"&#13;<br />modelanim "models\md5\anims\cinematics/cin_lobby_sci.md5anim"&#13;<br />modelpos 195.791 -102.819 0&#13;<br /><br />model 1&#13;<br />modelname "models\md5\meshes/security.md5mesh"&#13;<br />modelanim "models\md5\anims\cinematics/cin_lobby_sec1.md5anim"&#13;<br />modelpos -145.609 193.743 0&#13;<br /><br />model 2&#13;<br />modelname "models\md5\meshes/security.md5mesh"&#13;<br />modelanim "models\md5\anims\cinematics/cin_lobby_sec2.md5anim"&#13;<br />modelangle 0&#13;<br />modelpos 219.212 36.194 0</div>

						<div class="postbody">Thank you guys for all the feedback. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />First of all, don´t use paths with spaces in them. Not even if you put the pathnames in " " ...&#13;<br /><br />In the included scene.txt, you can just make two changes and you´ll see pinky breaking through the walls (if you have the alpha ofcourse):&#13;<br />- change the first line that says <span style="font-weight: bold">basepath</span>, to point to the base dir of the alpha.&#13;<br />- change the line that says "nummodels 3" to "nummodels 5". The models number 3 and 4 (count starts at zero so it´s 5 models then) are pinky and the wall. The other models (number 0, 1 and 2) will still be there.&#13;<br />Yeah this is inconvenient, it would be easier to handle if the numbers were just left out and all the models in the scene.txt would be read. Ofcourse the best thing would be on the fly model loading like rich pointed out.&#13;<br /><br />matt, what exactly do you mean with the "skinless" pinky? is it white, completely without textures?</div>

						<div class="postbody">That's a great little app der_ton, very impressive - definitely the best one I've seen so far. I'm trying a similar normal-mapped app myself, and since I got the doom3 models &amp; normal maps I figured I'd use them to learn how to do it. So I have a few technical questions if you don't mind! (that is if you still hang around here..)&#13;<br /><br />Are you using tangent-space bump-mapping? This is what I've been trying, but I haven't been having too much success. I'm using a vertex program to set it up, and then register combiners to do the dot product. However it all seems to be far too bright, compared with just standard opengl lighting. Also, the diffuse map seems to be very washed out - the model doesn't show up half the detail that should be there. I know this is a little vague, and if you're willing to answer a few questions I'll go into greater detail, but I just thought you might have come across the same sort of problems as me, and might be able to point me in the right direction!&#13;<br /><br />I'm not doing specular yet, since once I have this figured out then it shouldnt be too hard to extend it to include a gloss map. And I'm not using the height map texture either, just the base texture map and the normal map - would this be something to do with my problems?&#13;<br /><br />Here's an example:...&#13;<br /><span style="font-style: italic">&lt;&lt;screenshot removed&gt;&gt;</span>&#13;<br /><br /><br />Thanks!&#13;<br />satch</div>

<br /><br /><br />So has anyone tried it out with the Doom3 Models? Don´t forget to set the path variable in the scene.txt file to your D3-base-directory.
<br /><br />And then you can try setting the nummodels to 7 (was 5 in the original scene.txt). Maybe you´ve noticed that the scene.txt contains two more models, #5 and #6, that have been ignored.

<br /><br />Sorry, no focus switching yet...
<br /><br />Sorry, the problem with pinky is very simple to solve.
<br />For pinky´s "modelname" attribute in the scene file, use "maps\fred\bathroom/scene1pinkymesh.md5mesh"
<br /><br />The background for the sidenote that I wrote into the scene.txt is that pinky´s texture cannot be found in all the other pinky meshes that exist in the alpha, only this scene1pinkymesh.md5mesh works. That´s because the texture name in the meshfile is "wrong" for all the other pinky-meshes. Doom3 doesn´t care about that texture name since it reads the mtr file to see what textures to use for pinky, but my viewer doesn´t bother looking up the mtr file but tries to find the texture that´s written there in the mesh.
<br /><br />I found out that there´s a pinky mesh with the correct texture name just now, sorry. I always used a edited version of one of the other pinky-meshes.
<br /><br />By the way, if you want to see the scene with the two security guys and the scientist that bumps into one of them, put this into your scene.txt (instead of all the other modelstuff there):
<br /><br />nummodels 3 
<br /><br />model 0
<br />modelname "models\md5\meshes/scientist1.md5mesh"
<br />modelanim "models\md5\anims\cinematics/cin_lobby_sci.md5anim"
<br />modelpos 195.791 -102.819 0
<br /><br />model 1

Not even if you put the pathnames in " " ...
<br /><br />In the included scene.txt, you can just make two changes and you´ll see pinky breaking through the walls (if you have the alpha ofcourse):
<br />- change the first line that says <span style="font-weight: bold">basepath</span>, to point to the base dir of the alpha.
<br />- change the line that says "nummodels 3" to "nummodels 5". The models number 3 and 4 (count starts at zero so it´s 5 models then) are pinky and the wall. The other models (number 0, 1 and 2) will still be there.
<br />Yeah this is inconvenient, it would be easier to handle if the numbers were just left out and all the models in the scene.txt would be read. Ofcourse the best thing would be on the fly model loading like rich pointed out.

I'm trying a similar normal-mapped app myself, and since I got the doom3 models &amp; normal maps I figured I'd use them to learn how to do it. So I have a few technical questions if you don't mind! (that is if you still hang around here..)
<br /><br />Are you using tangent-space bump-mapping? This is what I've been trying, but I haven't been having too much success. I'm using a vertex program to set it up, and then register combiners to do the dot product. However it all seems to be far too bright, compared with just standard opengl lighting. Also, the diffuse map seems to be very washed out - the model doesn't show up half the detail that should be there. I know this is a little vague, and if you're willing to answer a few questions I'll go into greater detail, but I just thought you might have come across the same sort of problems as me, and might be able to point me in the right direction!
<br /><br />I'm not doing specular yet, since once I have this figured out then it shouldnt be too hard to extend it to include a gloss map. And I'm not using the height map texture either, just the base texture map and the normal map - would this be something to do with my problems?
<br /><br />Here's an example:...

<br /><br />Sorry, no focus switching yet...
<br /><br />Sorry, the problem with pinky is very simple to solve.
<br />For pinky´s "modelname" attribute in the scene file, use "maps\fred\bathroom/scene1pinkymesh.md5mesh"
<br /><br />The background for the sidenote that I wrote into the scene.txt is that pinky´s texture cannot be found in all the other pinky meshes that exist in the alpha, only this scene1pinkymesh.md5mesh works. That´s because the texture name in the meshfile is "wrong" for all the other pinky-meshes. Doom3 doesn´t care about that texture name since it reads the mtr file to see what textures to use for pinky, but my viewer doesn´t bother looking up the mtr file but tries to find the texture that´s written there in the mesh.
<br /><br />I found out that there´s a pinky mesh with the correct texture name just now, sorry. I always used a edited version of one of the other pinky-meshes.
<br /><br />By the way, if you want to see the scene with the two security guys and the scientist that bumps into one of them, put this into your scene.txt (instead of all the other modelstuff there):
<br /><br />nummodels 3 
<br /><br />model 0
<br />modelname "models\md5\meshes/scientist1.md5mesh"
<br />modelanim "models\md5\anims\cinematics/cin_lobby_sci.md5anim"
<br />modelpos 195.791 -102.819 0

Not even if you put the pathnames in " " ...
<br /><br />In the included scene.txt, you can just make two changes and you´ll see pinky breaking through the walls (if you have the alpha ofcourse):
<br />- change the first line that says <span style="font-weight: bold">basepath</span>, to point to the base dir of the alpha.
<br />- change the line that says "nummodels 3" to "nummodels 5". The models number 3 and 4 (count starts at zero so it´s 5 models then) are pinky and the wall. The other models (number 0, 1 and 2) will still be there.
<br />Yeah this is inconvenient, it would be easier to handle if the numbers were just left out and all the models in the scene.txt would be read. Ofcourse the best thing would be on the fly model loading like rich pointed out.

I'm trying a similar normal-mapped app myself, and since I got the doom3 models &amp; normal maps I figured I'd use them to learn how to do it. So I have a few technical questions if you don't mind! (that is if you still hang around here..)
<br /><br />Are you using tangent-space bump-mapping? This is what I've been trying, but I haven't been having too much success. I'm using a vertex program to set it up, and then register combiners to do the dot product. However it all seems to be far too bright, compared with just standard opengl lighting. Also, the diffuse map seems to be very washed out - the model doesn't show up half the detail that should be there. I know this is a little vague, and if you're willing to answer a few questions I'll go into greater detail, but I just thought you might have come across the same sort of problems as me, and might be able to point me in the right direction!
<br /><br />I'm not doing specular yet, since once I have this figured out then it shouldnt be too hard to extend it to include a gloss map. And I'm not using the height map texture either, just the base texture map and the normal map - would this be something to do with my problems?
<br /><br />Here's an example:...

I'm trying a similar normal-mapped app myself, and since I got the doom3 models &amp; normal maps I figured I'd use them to learn how to do it. So I have a few technical questions if you don't mind! (that is if you still hang around here..)&#13;<br /><br />Are you using tangent-space bump-mapping? This is what I've been trying, but I haven't been having too much success. I'm using a vertex program to set it up, and then register combiners to do the dot product. However it all seems to be far too bright, compared with just standard opengl lighting. Also, the diffuse map seems to be very washed out - the model doesn't show up half the detail that should be there. I know this is a little vague, and if you're willing to answer a few questions I'll go into greater detail, but I just thought you might have come across the same sort of problems as me, and might be able to point me in the right direction!&#13;<br /><br />I'm not doing specular yet, since once I have this figured out then it shouldnt be too hard to extend it to include a gloss map. And I'm not using the height map texture either, just the base texture map and the normal map - would this be something to do with my problems?&#13;<br /><br />Here's an example:...&#13;<br /><span style="font-style: italic">&lt;&lt;screenshot removed&gt;&gt;</span>&#13;<br /><br /><br />Thanks!&#13;<br />satch</div>]]></body></post><post id="p16624" date="Posted: Mon Dec 15, 2003 7:54 pm "><author>Burrito</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Hi satchmo,&#13;<br /><br />welcome to the board.

I hope it´s self-explanatory. And you guys just LOVE anything that looks like a ascii-script, right? ;-D<br /><br />Sorry for the shitty specular lighting... it´s difficult to do that in a optically correct way with 4 texture units and using no NV or ATI extension. I´ll either add a codepath for NV_register_combiner extension, or add support for 8 texture units, or I´ll go all the way to ARB_fragment_program.<br /><br />The framerate is not good, I know, but this is not optimized yet. And I don´t have any assembly language inner loops, not to mention MMX/SSE stuff. And it doesn´t use vertex programs (yet), so all the math is done by the CPU. <br />And the framerate used to be twice as high, until I had to restructure the tangent space calculation because of the symmetry seam issue.<br /><br />There was so much more that I wanted to mention about the program, but let´s do it the other way round, just ask questions of what you want to know. I´m switching to lazy mode now. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />der_ton</div>

						<div class="postbody">yes I know that when you let the animation run backwards, at some point the absolute animation time becomes negative, and the animation time is clamped to 0.&#13;<br />I thought that that´s the most reasonable behaviour for the animation.&#13;<br /><br />Yes I know, the font rendering is really poopy... <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />  But I didn´t really want to concentrate on that boring stuff too much, so I chose to get some example code from some tutorial and if it works I won´t touch it.&#13;<br /><br /><br />So has anyone tried it out with the Doom3 Models? Don´t forget to set the path variable in the scene.txt file to your D3-base-directory.&#13;<br /><br />And then you can try setting the nummodels to 7 (was 5 in the original scene.txt). Maybe you´ve noticed that the scene.txt contains two more models, #5 and #6, that have been ignored. That´s kind of an easter egg... lol.</div>

How do you switch the object in focus?</div>&#13;<br /><br />Sorry, no focus switching yet...&#13;<br /><br />Sorry, the problem with pinky is very simple to solve.&#13;<br />For pinky´s "modelname" attribute in the scene file, use "maps\fred\bathroom/scene1pinkymesh.md5mesh"&#13;<br /><br />The background for the sidenote that I wrote into the scene.txt is that pinky´s texture cannot be found in all the other pinky meshes that exist in the alpha, only this scene1pinkymesh.md5mesh works. That´s because the texture name in the meshfile is "wrong" for all the other pinky-meshes. Doom3 doesn´t care about that texture name since it reads the mtr file to see what textures to use for pinky, but my viewer doesn´t bother looking up the mtr file but tries to find the texture that´s written there in the mesh.&#13;<br /><br />I found out that there´s a pinky mesh with the correct texture name just now, sorry. I always used a edited version of one of the other pinky-meshes.&#13;<br /><br />By the way, if you want to see the scene with the two security guys and the scientist that bumps into one of them, put this into your scene.txt (instead of all the other modelstuff there):&#13;<br /><br />nummodels 3 &#13;<br /><br />model 0&#13;<br />modelname "models\md5\meshes/scientist1.md5mesh"&#13;<br />modelanim "models\md5\anims\cinematics/cin_lobby_sci.md5anim"&#13;<br />modelpos 195.791 -102.819 0&#13;<br /><br />model 1&#13;<br />modelname "models\md5\meshes/security.md5mesh"&#13;<br />modelanim "models\md5\anims\cinematics/cin_lobby_sec1.md5anim"&#13;<br />modelpos -145.609 193.743 0&#13;<br /><br />model 2&#13;<br />modelname "models\md5\meshes/security.md5mesh"&#13;<br />modelanim "models\md5\anims\cinematics/cin_lobby_sec2.md5anim"&#13;<br />modelangle 0&#13;<br />modelpos 219.212 36.194 0</div>

						<div class="postbody">Thank you guys for all the feedback. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />First of all, don´t use paths with spaces in them. Not even if you put the pathnames in " " ...&#13;<br /><br />In the included scene.txt, you can just make two changes and you´ll see pinky breaking through the walls (if you have the alpha ofcourse):&#13;<br />- change the first line that says <span style="font-weight: bold">basepath</span>, to point to the base dir of the alpha.&#13;<br />- change the line that says "nummodels 3" to "nummodels 5". The models number 3 and 4 (count starts at zero so it´s 5 models then) are pinky and the wall. The other models (number 0, 1 and 2) will still be there.&#13;<br />Yeah this is inconvenient, it would be easier to handle if the numbers were just left out and all the models in the scene.txt would be read. Ofcourse the best thing would be on the fly model loading like rich pointed out.&#13;<br /><br />matt, what exactly do you mean with the "skinless" pinky? is it white, completely without textures?</div>

I hope it´s self-explanatory. And you guys just LOVE anything that looks like a ascii-script, right? ;-D<br /><br />Sorry for the shitty specular lighting... it´s difficult to do that in a optically correct way with 4 texture units and using no NV or ATI extension. I´ll either add a codepath for NV_register_combiner extension, or add support for 8 texture units, or I´ll go all the way to ARB_fragment_program.<br /><br />The framerate is not good, I know, but this is not optimized yet. And I don´t have any assembly language inner loops, not to mention MMX/SSE stuff. And it doesn´t use vertex programs (yet), so all the math is done by the CPU. <br />And the framerate used to be twice as high, until I had to restructure the tangent space calculation because of the symmetry seam issue.<br /><br />There was so much more that I wanted to mention about the program, but let´s do it the other way round, just ask questions of what you want to know.

<br /><br /><br />So has anyone tried it out with the Doom3 Models? Don´t forget to set the path variable in the scene.txt file to your D3-base-directory.
<br /><br />And then you can try setting the nummodels to 7 (was 5 in the original scene.txt). Maybe you´ve noticed that the scene.txt contains two more models, #5 and #6, that have been ignored.

<br /><br />Sorry, no focus switching yet...
<br /><br />Sorry, the problem with pinky is very simple to solve.
<br />For pinky´s "modelname" attribute in the scene file, use "maps\fred\bathroom/scene1pinkymesh.md5mesh"
<br /><br />The background for the sidenote that I wrote into the scene.txt is that pinky´s texture cannot be found in all the other pinky meshes that exist in the alpha, only this scene1pinkymesh.md5mesh works. That´s because the texture name in the meshfile is "wrong" for all the other pinky-meshes. Doom3 doesn´t care about that texture name since it reads the mtr file to see what textures to use for pinky, but my viewer doesn´t bother looking up the mtr file but tries to find the texture that´s written there in the mesh.
<br /><br />I found out that there´s a pinky mesh with the correct texture name just now, sorry. I always used a edited version of one of the other pinky-meshes.
<br /><br />By the way, if you want to see the scene with the two security guys and the scientist that bumps into one of them, put this into your scene.txt (instead of all the other modelstuff there):
<br /><br />nummodels 3 
<br /><br />model 0
<br />modelname "models\md5\meshes/scientist1.md5mesh"
<br />modelanim "models\md5\anims\cinematics/cin_lobby_sci.md5anim"
<br />modelpos 195.791 -102.819 0
<br /><br />model 1

Not even if you put the pathnames in " " ...
<br /><br />In the included scene.txt, you can just make two changes and you´ll see pinky breaking through the walls (if you have the alpha ofcourse):
<br />- change the first line that says <span style="font-weight: bold">basepath</span>, to point to the base dir of the alpha.
<br />- change the line that says "nummodels 3" to "nummodels 5". The models number 3 and 4 (count starts at zero so it´s 5 models then) are pinky and the wall. The other models (number 0, 1 and 2) will still be there.
<br />Yeah this is inconvenient, it would be easier to handle if the numbers were just left out and all the models in the scene.txt would be read. Ofcourse the best thing would be on the fly model loading like rich pointed out.

I hope it´s self-explanatory. And you guys just LOVE anything that looks like a ascii-script, right? ;-D<br /><br />Sorry for the shitty specular lighting... it´s difficult to do that in a optically correct way with 4 texture units and using no NV or ATI extension. I´ll either add a codepath for NV_register_combiner extension, or add support for 8 texture units, or I´ll go all the way to ARB_fragment_program.<br /><br />The framerate is not good, I know, but this is not optimized yet. And I don´t have any assembly language inner loops, not to mention MMX/SSE stuff. And it doesn´t use vertex programs (yet), so all the math is done by the CPU. <br />And the framerate used to be twice as high, until I had to restructure the tangent space calculation because of the symmetry seam issue.<br /><br />There was so much more that I wanted to mention about the program, but let´s do it the other way round, just ask questions of what you want to know. I´m switching to lazy mode now. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />der_ton</div>]]></body></post><post id="p11105" date="Posted: Thu Aug 07, 2003 7:50 am "><author>_shank</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">neat...dont know much bout it...but just appreciating the effort u put in&#13;<br /><br />the butterfly stopped flapping after i did shift + x(after the initial fast flapping)</div>]]></body></post><post id="p11110" date="Posted: Thu Aug 07, 2003 9:18 am "><author>KPixel</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Really nice !&#13;<br /><br />On side note : The rendering of font (when rendering help) really kill FPS <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p11117" date="Posted: Thu Aug 07, 2003 10:48 am "><author>der_ton</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">yes I know that when you let the animation run backwards, at some point the absolute animation time becomes negative, and the animation time is clamped to 0.&#13;<br />I thought that that´s the most reasonable behaviour for the animation.&#13;<br /><br />Yes I know, the font rendering is really poopy... <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />  But I didn´t really want to concentrate on that boring stuff too much, so I chose to get some example code from some tutorial and if it works I won´t touch it.&#13;<br /><br /><br />So has anyone tried it out with the Doom3 Models?

How do you switch the object in focus?</div>&#13;<br /><br />Sorry, no focus switching yet...&#13;<br /><br />Sorry, the problem with pinky is very simple to solve.&#13;<br />For pinky´s "modelname" attribute in the scene file, use "maps\fred\bathroom/scene1pinkymesh.md5mesh"&#13;<br /><br />The background for the sidenote that I wrote into the scene.txt is that pinky´s texture cannot be found in all the other pinky meshes that exist in the alpha, only this scene1pinkymesh.md5mesh works. That´s because the texture name in the meshfile is "wrong" for all the other pinky-meshes. Doom3 doesn´t care about that texture name since it reads the mtr file to see what textures to use for pinky, but my viewer doesn´t bother looking up the mtr file but tries to find the texture that´s written there in the mesh.&#13;<br /><br />I found out that there´s a pinky mesh with the correct texture name just now, sorry. I always used a edited version of one of the other pinky-meshes.&#13;<br /><br />By the way, if you want to see the scene with the two security guys and the scientist that bumps into one of them, put this into your scene.txt (instead of all the other modelstuff there):&#13;<br /><br />nummodels 3 &#13;<br /><br />model 0&#13;<br />modelname "models\md5\meshes/scientist1.md5mesh"&#13;<br />modelanim "models\md5\anims\cinematics/cin_lobby_sci.md5anim"&#13;<br />modelpos 195.791 -102.819 0&#13;<br /><br />model 1&#13;<br />modelname "models\md5\meshes/security.md5mesh"&#13;<br />modelanim "models\md5\anims\cinematics/cin_lobby_sec1.md5anim"&#13;<br />modelpos -145.609 193.743 0&#13;<br /><br />model 2&#13;<br />modelname "models\md5\meshes/security.md5mesh"&#13;<br />modelanim "models\md5\anims\cinematics/cin_lobby_sec2.md5anim"&#13;<br />modelangle 0&#13;<br />modelpos 219.212 36.194 0</div>]]></body></post><post id="p14299" date="Posted: Thu Oct 16, 2003 12:18 am "><author>der_ton</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">There´s a new version,&#13;<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/doom3/der_ton/modelviewer.zip">http://www.doom3world.org/doom3/der_ton/modelviewer.zip</a><!-- m -->&#13;<br /><br />-improved specular lighting on Geforce3+&#13;<br />-switch the object in focus (thanks rich)&#13;<br />-improved flexibility for camera movement&#13;<br />-can draw character skeletons&#13;<br />-reads obj and ase models, too&#13;<br /><br />Nothing stunning, but I felt like improving it a little more. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p14308" date="Posted: Thu Oct 16, 2003 2:30 am "><author>kat</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">downloaded for a looksee..</div>]]></body></post><post id="p14309" date="Posted: Thu Oct 16, 2003 4:00 am "><author>rich_is_bored</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">You know what would be real nice is if you could change the models/animations being rendered without editing the scene.txt.

Not even if you put the pathnames in " " ...&#13;<br /><br />In the included scene.txt, you can just make two changes and you´ll see pinky breaking through the walls (if you have the alpha ofcourse):&#13;<br />- change the first line that says <span style="font-weight: bold">basepath</span>, to point to the base dir of the alpha.&#13;<br />- change the line that says "nummodels 3" to "nummodels 5". The models number 3 and 4 (count starts at zero so it´s 5 models then) are pinky and the wall. The other models (number 0, 1 and 2) will still be there.&#13;<br />Yeah this is inconvenient, it would be easier to handle if the numbers were just left out and all the models in the scene.txt would be read. Ofcourse the best thing would be on the fly model loading like rich pointed out.&#13;<br /><br />matt, what exactly do you mean with the "skinless" pinky? is it white, completely without textures?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p14409" date="Posted: Fri Oct 17, 2003 10:52 pm "><author>rich_is_bored</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Oh, I just had another idea.

I'm trying a similar normal-mapped app myself, and since I got the doom3 models &amp; normal maps I figured I'd use them to learn how to do it. So I have a few technical questions if you don't mind! (that is if you still hang around here..)&#13;<br /><br />Are you using tangent-space bump-mapping? This is what I've been trying, but I haven't been having too much success. I'm using a vertex program to set it up, and then register combiners to do the dot product. However it all seems to be far too bright, compared with just standard opengl lighting. Also, the diffuse map seems to be very washed out - the model doesn't show up half the detail that should be there. I know this is a little vague, and if you're willing to answer a few questions I'll go into greater detail, but I just thought you might have come across the same sort of problems as me, and might be able to point me in the right direction!&#13;<br /><br />I'm not doing specular yet, since once I have this figured out then it shouldnt be too hard to extend it to include a gloss map. And I'm not using the height map texture either, just the base texture map and the normal map - would this be something to do with my problems?&#13;<br /><br />Here's an example:...&#13;<br /><span style="font-style: italic">&lt;&lt;screenshot removed&gt;&gt;</span>&#13;<br /><br /><br />Thanks!&#13;<br />satch</div>]]></body></post><post id="p16624" date="Posted: Mon Dec 15, 2003 7:54 pm "><author>Burrito</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Hi satchmo,&#13;<br /><br />welcome to the board.

I hope it´s self-explanatory. And you guys just LOVE anything that looks like a ascii-script, right? ;-D<br /><br />Sorry for the shitty specular lighting... it´s difficult to do that in a optically correct way with 4 texture units and using no NV or ATI extension. I´ll either add a codepath for NV_register_combiner extension, or add support for 8 texture units, or I´ll go all the way to ARB_fragment_program.<br /><br />The framerate is not good, I know, but this is not optimized yet. And I don´t have any assembly language inner loops, not to mention MMX/SSE stuff. And it doesn´t use vertex programs (yet), so all the math is done by the CPU. <br />And the framerate used to be twice as high, until I had to restructure the tangent space calculation because of the symmetry seam issue.<br /><br />There was so much more that I wanted to mention about the program, but let´s do it the other way round, just ask questions of what you want to know. I´m switching to lazy mode now. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />der_ton</div>

						<div class="postbody">yes I know that when you let the animation run backwards, at some point the absolute animation time becomes negative, and the animation time is clamped to 0.&#13;<br />I thought that that´s the most reasonable behaviour for the animation.&#13;<br /><br />Yes I know, the font rendering is really poopy... <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />  But I didn´t really want to concentrate on that boring stuff too much, so I chose to get some example code from some tutorial and if it works I won´t touch it.&#13;<br /><br /><br />So has anyone tried it out with the Doom3 Models? Don´t forget to set the path variable in the scene.txt file to your D3-base-directory.&#13;<br /><br />And then you can try setting the nummodels to 7 (was 5 in the original scene.txt). Maybe you´ve noticed that the scene.txt contains two more models, #5 and #6, that have been ignored. That´s kind of an easter egg... lol.</div>

How do you switch the object in focus?</div>&#13;<br /><br />Sorry, no focus switching yet...&#13;<br /><br />Sorry, the problem with pinky is very simple to solve.&#13;<br />For pinky´s "modelname" attribute in the scene file, use "maps\fred\bathroom/scene1pinkymesh.md5mesh"&#13;<br /><br />The background for the sidenote that I wrote into the scene.txt is that pinky´s texture cannot be found in all the other pinky meshes that exist in the alpha, only this scene1pinkymesh.md5mesh works. That´s because the texture name in the meshfile is "wrong" for all the other pinky-meshes. Doom3 doesn´t care about that texture name since it reads the mtr file to see what textures to use for pinky, but my viewer doesn´t bother looking up the mtr file but tries to find the texture that´s written there in the mesh.&#13;<br /><br />I found out that there´s a pinky mesh with the correct texture name just now, sorry. I always used a edited version of one of the other pinky-meshes.&#13;<br /><br />By the way, if you want to see the scene with the two security guys and the scientist that bumps into one of them, put this into your scene.txt (instead of all the other modelstuff there):&#13;<br /><br />nummodels 3 &#13;<br /><br />model 0&#13;<br />modelname "models\md5\meshes/scientist1.md5mesh"&#13;<br />modelanim "models\md5\anims\cinematics/cin_lobby_sci.md5anim"&#13;<br />modelpos 195.791 -102.819 0&#13;<br /><br />model 1&#13;<br />modelname "models\md5\meshes/security.md5mesh"&#13;<br />modelanim "models\md5\anims\cinematics/cin_lobby_sec1.md5anim"&#13;<br />modelpos -145.609 193.743 0&#13;<br /><br />model 2&#13;<br />modelname "models\md5\meshes/security.md5mesh"&#13;<br />modelanim "models\md5\anims\cinematics/cin_lobby_sec2.md5anim"&#13;<br />modelangle 0&#13;<br />modelpos 219.212 36.194 0</div>

						<div class="postbody">Thank you guys for all the feedback. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />First of all, don´t use paths with spaces in them. Not even if you put the pathnames in " " ...&#13;<br /><br />In the included scene.txt, you can just make two changes and you´ll see pinky breaking through the walls (if you have the alpha ofcourse):&#13;<br />- change the first line that says <span style="font-weight: bold">basepath</span>, to point to the base dir of the alpha.&#13;<br />- change the line that says "nummodels 3" to "nummodels 5". The models number 3 and 4 (count starts at zero so it´s 5 models then) are pinky and the wall. The other models (number 0, 1 and 2) will still be there.&#13;<br />Yeah this is inconvenient, it would be easier to handle if the numbers were just left out and all the models in the scene.txt would be read. Ofcourse the best thing would be on the fly model loading like rich pointed out.&#13;<br /><br />matt, what exactly do you mean with the "skinless" pinky? is it white, completely without textures?</div>

						<div class="postbody">That's a great little app der_ton, very impressive - definitely the best one I've seen so far. I'm trying a similar normal-mapped app myself, and since I got the doom3 models &amp; normal maps I figured I'd use them to learn how to do it. So I have a few technical questions if you don't mind! (that is if you still hang around here..)&#13;<br /><br />Are you using tangent-space bump-mapping? This is what I've been trying, but I haven't been having too much success. I'm using a vertex program to set it up, and then register combiners to do the dot product. However it all seems to be far too bright, compared with just standard opengl lighting. Also, the diffuse map seems to be very washed out - the model doesn't show up half the detail that should be there. I know this is a little vague, and if you're willing to answer a few questions I'll go into greater detail, but I just thought you might have come across the same sort of problems as me, and might be able to point me in the right direction!&#13;<br /><br />I'm not doing specular yet, since once I have this figured out then it shouldnt be too hard to extend it to include a gloss map. And I'm not using the height map texture either, just the base texture map and the normal map - would this be something to do with my problems?&#13;<br /><br />Here's an example:...&#13;<br /><span style="font-style: italic">&lt;&lt;screenshot removed&gt;&gt;</span>&#13;<br /><br /><br />Thanks!&#13;<br />satch</div>

<br /><br />Sorry, no focus switching yet...
<br /><br />Sorry, the problem with pinky is very simple to solve.
<br />For pinky´s "modelname" attribute in the scene file, use "maps\fred\bathroom/scene1pinkymesh.md5mesh"
<br /><br />The background for the sidenote that I wrote into the scene.txt is that pinky´s texture cannot be found in all the other pinky meshes that exist in the alpha, only this scene1pinkymesh.md5mesh works. That´s because the texture name in the meshfile is "wrong" for all the other pinky-meshes. Doom3 doesn´t care about that texture name since it reads the mtr file to see what textures to use for pinky, but my viewer doesn´t bother looking up the mtr file but tries to find the texture that´s written there in the mesh.
<br /><br />I found out that there´s a pinky mesh with the correct texture name just now, sorry. I always used a edited version of one of the other pinky-meshes.
<br /><br />By the way, if you want to see the scene with the two security guys and the scientist that bumps into one of them, put this into your scene.txt (instead of all the other modelstuff there):
<br /><br />nummodels 3 
<br /><br />model 0
<br />modelname "models\md5\meshes/scientist1.md5mesh"
<br />modelanim "models\md5\anims\cinematics/cin_lobby_sci.md5anim"

Perhaps a shortcut key to bring up a browse window for the model in focus which allows you to select a md5 model or animation.

Not even if you put the pathnames in " " ...
<br /><br />In the included scene.txt, you can just make two changes and you´ll see pinky breaking through the walls (if you have the alpha ofcourse):
<br />- change the first line that says <span style="font-weight: bold">basepath</span>, to point to the base dir of the alpha.
<br />- change the line that says "nummodels 3" to "nummodels 5". The models number 3 and 4 (count starts at zero so it´s 5 models then) are pinky and the wall. The other models (number 0, 1 and 2) will still be there.
<br />Yeah this is inconvenient, it would be easier to handle if the numbers were just left out and all the models in the scene.txt would be read. Ofcourse the best thing would be on the fly model loading like rich pointed out.
<br /><br />matt, what exactly do you mean with the "skinless" pinky? is it white, completely without textures?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p14409" date="Posted: Fri Oct 17, 2003 10:52 pm "><author>rich_is_bored</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Oh, I just had another idea.

I'm trying a similar normal-mapped app myself, and since I got the doom3 models &amp; normal maps I figured I'd use them to learn how to do it. So I have a few technical questions if you don't mind! (that is if you still hang around here..)
<br /><br />Are you using tangent-space bump-mapping? This is what I've been trying, but I haven't been having too much success. I'm using a vertex program to set it up, and then register combiners to do the dot product. However it all seems to be far too bright, compared with just standard opengl lighting. Also, the diffuse map seems to be very washed out - the model doesn't show up half the detail that should be there. I know this is a little vague, and if you're willing to answer a few questions I'll go into greater detail, but I just thought you might have come across the same sort of problems as me, and might be able to point me in the right direction!
<br /><br />I'm not doing specular yet, since once I have this figured out then it shouldnt be too hard to extend it to include a gloss map. And I'm not using the height map texture either, just the base texture map and the normal map - would this be something to do with my problems?
<br /><br />Here's an example:...

Not even if you put the pathnames in " " ...&#13;<br /><br />In the included scene.txt, you can just make two changes and you´ll see pinky breaking through the walls (if you have the alpha ofcourse):&#13;<br />- change the first line that says <span style="font-weight: bold">basepath</span>, to point to the base dir of the alpha.&#13;<br />- change the line that says "nummodels 3" to "nummodels 5". The models number 3 and 4 (count starts at zero so it´s 5 models then) are pinky and the wall. The other models (number 0, 1 and 2) will still be there.&#13;<br />Yeah this is inconvenient, it would be easier to handle if the numbers were just left out and all the models in the scene.txt would be read. Ofcourse the best thing would be on the fly model loading like rich pointed out.&#13;<br /><br />matt, what exactly do you mean with the "skinless" pinky? is it white, completely without textures?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p14409" date="Posted: Fri Oct 17, 2003 10:52 pm "><author>rich_is_bored</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Oh, I just had another idea.

I'm trying a similar normal-mapped app myself, and since I got the doom3 models &amp; normal maps I figured I'd use them to learn how to do it. So I have a few technical questions if you don't mind! (that is if you still hang around here..)&#13;<br /><br />Are you using tangent-space bump-mapping? This is what I've been trying, but I haven't been having too much success. I'm using a vertex program to set it up, and then register combiners to do the dot product. However it all seems to be far too bright, compared with just standard opengl lighting. Also, the diffuse map seems to be very washed out - the model doesn't show up half the detail that should be there. I know this is a little vague, and if you're willing to answer a few questions I'll go into greater detail, but I just thought you might have come across the same sort of problems as me, and might be able to point me in the right direction!&#13;<br /><br />I'm not doing specular yet, since once I have this figured out then it shouldnt be too hard to extend it to include a gloss map. And I'm not using the height map texture either, just the base texture map and the normal map - would this be something to do with my problems?&#13;<br /><br />Here's an example:...&#13;<br /><span style="font-style: italic">&lt;&lt;screenshot removed&gt;&gt;</span>&#13;<br /><br /><br />Thanks!&#13;<br />satch</div>]]></body></post><post id="p16624" date="Posted: Mon Dec 15, 2003 7:54 pm "><author>Burrito</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Hi satchmo,&#13;<br /><br />welcome to the board.

I hope it´s self-explanatory. And you guys just LOVE anything that looks like a ascii-script, right? ;-D<br /><br />Sorry for the shitty specular lighting... it´s difficult to do that in a optically correct way with 4 texture units and using no NV or ATI extension. I´ll either add a codepath for NV_register_combiner extension, or add support for 8 texture units, or I´ll go all the way to ARB_fragment_program.<br /><br />The framerate is not good, I know, but this is not optimized yet. And I don´t have any assembly language inner loops, not to mention MMX/SSE stuff. And it doesn´t use vertex programs (yet), so all the math is done by the CPU. <br />And the framerate used to be twice as high, until I had to restructure the tangent space calculation because of the symmetry seam issue.<br /><br />There was so much more that I wanted to mention about the program, but let´s do it the other way round, just ask questions of what you want to know. I´m switching to lazy mode now. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />der_ton</div>

						<div class="postbody">yes I know that when you let the animation run backwards, at some point the absolute animation time becomes negative, and the animation time is clamped to 0.&#13;<br />I thought that that´s the most reasonable behaviour for the animation.&#13;<br /><br />Yes I know, the font rendering is really poopy... <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />  But I didn´t really want to concentrate on that boring stuff too much, so I chose to get some example code from some tutorial and if it works I won´t touch it.&#13;<br /><br /><br />So has anyone tried it out with the Doom3 Models? Don´t forget to set the path variable in the scene.txt file to your D3-base-directory.&#13;<br /><br />And then you can try setting the nummodels to 7 (was 5 in the original scene.txt). Maybe you´ve noticed that the scene.txt contains two more models, #5 and #6, that have been ignored. That´s kind of an easter egg... lol.</div>

How do you switch the object in focus?</div>&#13;<br /><br />Sorry, no focus switching yet...&#13;<br /><br />Sorry, the problem with pinky is very simple to solve.&#13;<br />For pinky´s "modelname" attribute in the scene file, use "maps\fred\bathroom/scene1pinkymesh.md5mesh"&#13;<br /><br />The background for the sidenote that I wrote into the scene.txt is that pinky´s texture cannot be found in all the other pinky meshes that exist in the alpha, only this scene1pinkymesh.md5mesh works. That´s because the texture name in the meshfile is "wrong" for all the other pinky-meshes. Doom3 doesn´t care about that texture name since it reads the mtr file to see what textures to use for pinky, but my viewer doesn´t bother looking up the mtr file but tries to find the texture that´s written there in the mesh.&#13;<br /><br />I found out that there´s a pinky mesh with the correct texture name just now, sorry. I always used a edited version of one of the other pinky-meshes.&#13;<br /><br />By the way, if you want to see the scene with the two security guys and the scientist that bumps into one of them, put this into your scene.txt (instead of all the other modelstuff there):&#13;<br /><br />nummodels 3 &#13;<br /><br />model 0&#13;<br />modelname "models\md5\meshes/scientist1.md5mesh"&#13;<br />modelanim "models\md5\anims\cinematics/cin_lobby_sci.md5anim"&#13;<br />modelpos 195.791 -102.819 0&#13;<br /><br />model 1&#13;<br />modelname "models\md5\meshes/security.md5mesh"&#13;<br />modelanim "models\md5\anims\cinematics/cin_lobby_sec1.md5anim"&#13;<br />modelpos -145.609 193.743 0&#13;<br /><br />model 2&#13;<br />modelname "models\md5\meshes/security.md5mesh"&#13;<br />modelanim "models\md5\anims\cinematics/cin_lobby_sec2.md5anim"&#13;<br />modelangle 0&#13;<br />modelpos 219.212 36.194 0</div>

						<div class="postbody">You know what would be real nice is if you could change the models/animations being rendered without editing the scene.txt. Perhaps a shortcut key to bring up a browse window for the model in focus which allows you to select a md5 model or animation. Then the selected model or animation would replace the model or animation in focus.&#13;<br /><br />It's still a great piece of software der_ton. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>

						<div class="postbody">Thank you guys for all the feedback. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />First of all, don´t use paths with spaces in them. Not even if you put the pathnames in " " ...&#13;<br /><br />In the included scene.txt, you can just make two changes and you´ll see pinky breaking through the walls (if you have the alpha ofcourse):&#13;<br />- change the first line that says <span style="font-weight: bold">basepath</span>, to point to the base dir of the alpha.&#13;<br />- change the line that says "nummodels 3" to "nummodels 5". The models number 3 and 4 (count starts at zero so it´s 5 models then) are pinky and the wall. The other models (number 0, 1 and 2) will still be there.&#13;<br />Yeah this is inconvenient, it would be easier to handle if the numbers were just left out and all the models in the scene.txt would be read. Ofcourse the best thing would be on the fly model loading like rich pointed out.&#13;<br /><br />matt, what exactly do you mean with the "skinless" pinky? is it white, completely without textures?</div>

						<div class="postbody">That's a great little app der_ton, very impressive - definitely the best one I've seen so far. I'm trying a similar normal-mapped app myself, and since I got the doom3 models &amp; normal maps I figured I'd use them to learn how to do it. So I have a few technical questions if you don't mind! (that is if you still hang around here..)&#13;<br /><br />Are you using tangent-space bump-mapping? This is what I've been trying, but I haven't been having too much success. I'm using a vertex program to set it up, and then register combiners to do the dot product. However it all seems to be far too bright, compared with just standard opengl lighting. Also, the diffuse map seems to be very washed out - the model doesn't show up half the detail that should be there. I know this is a little vague, and if you're willing to answer a few questions I'll go into greater detail, but I just thought you might have come across the same sort of problems as me, and might be able to point me in the right direction!&#13;<br /><br />I'm not doing specular yet, since once I have this figured out then it shouldnt be too hard to extend it to include a gloss map. And I'm not using the height map texture either, just the base texture map and the normal map - would this be something to do with my problems?&#13;<br /><br />Here's an example:...&#13;<br /><span style="font-style: italic">&lt;&lt;screenshot removed&gt;&gt;</span>&#13;<br /><br /><br />Thanks!&#13;<br />satch</div>

OUTDATED INFO:&#13;
<br/><br/>
Ok, now itÃÂ´s time to release a (not yet perfect) version of this md5viewer.&#13;
<br/>
I included some md5models (one of them animated), which will probably be the bigger attractor for most of you, since there are several md5viewers out there (none of them technically as advanced as mine, though <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0"/>, but I havenÃÂ´t seen ANY selfmade md5model/anim ever. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0"/><br/>
But donÃÂ´t expect too much of the models, theyÃÂ´re made with notepad, and my texture creation skills are flat zero, and the butterfly texture is taken from NVidiaÃÂ´s Dawn demo...&#13;
<br/><br/>
Link to the old thread with screenshots:&#13;
<br/><a href="viewtopic.php?t=1139" target="_blank" class="postlink">http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=1139</a>&#13;
<br/><br/>
HereÃÂ´s the link, thanks to BNA! for uploading it!&#13;
<br/>
updated a few times now, this is the latest version (see my posting from 2004-01-16 below):&#13;
<br/><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://home.tiscali.de/der_ton/modelviewer.rar" target="_blank" class="postlink">http://home.tiscali.de/der_ton/modelviewer.rar</a>&#13;
<br/><br/>
To view other models that you might have  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0"/>  , edit the scene.txt file. I hope itÃÂ´s self-explanatory. And you guys just LOVE anything that looks like a ascii-script, right? ;-D&#13;
<br/><br/>
Sorry for the shitty specular lighting... itÃÂ´s difficult to do that in a optically correct way with 4 texture units and using no NV or ATI extension. IÃÂ´ll either add a codepath for NV_register_combiner extension, or add support for 8 texture units, or IÃÂ´ll go all the way to ARB_fragment_program.&#13;
<br/><br/>
The framerate is not good, I know, but this is not optimized yet. And I donÃÂ´t have any assembly language inner loops, not to mention MMX/SSE stuff. And it doesnÃÂ´t use vertex programs (yet), so all the math is done by the CPU. &#13;
<br/>
And the framerate used to be twice as high, until I had to restructure the tangent space calculation because of the symmetry seam issue.&#13;
<br/><br/>
There was so much more that I wanted to mention about the program, but letÃÂ´s do it the other way round, just ask questions of what you want to know. IÃÂ´m switching to lazy mode now. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0"/><br/><br/>

Yes I know, the font rendering is really poopy... <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0"/>  But I didnÃÂ´t really want to concentrate on that boring stuff too much, so I chose to get some example code from some tutorial and if it works I wonÃÂ´t touch it.&#13;
<br/><br/><br/>
So has anyone tried it out with the Doom3 Models? DonÃÂ´t forget to set the path variable in the scene.txt file to your D3-base-directory.&#13;
<br/><br/>
And then you can try setting the nummodels to 7 (was 5 in the original scene.txt). Maybe youÃÂ´ve noticed that the scene.txt contains two more models, #5 and #6, that have been ignored. ThatÃÂ´s kind of an easter egg... lol.</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

Sorry, no focus switching yet...&#13;
<br/><br/>
Sorry, the problem with pinky is very simple to solve.&#13;
<br/>
For pinkyÃÂ´s "modelname" attribute in the scene file, use "maps\fred\bathroom/scene1pinkymesh.md5mesh"&#13;
<br/><br/>
The background for the sidenote that I wrote into the scene.txt is that pinkyÃÂ´s texture cannot be found in all the other pinky meshes that exist in the alpha, only this scene1pinkymesh.md5mesh works. ThatÃÂ´s because the texture name in the meshfile is "wrong" for all the other pinky-meshes. Doom3 doesnÃÂ´t care about that texture name since it reads the mtr file to see what textures to use for pinky, but my viewer doesnÃÂ´t bother looking up the mtr file but tries to find the texture thatÃÂ´s written there in the mesh.&#13;
<br/><br/>
I found out that thereÃÂ´s a pinky mesh with the correct texture name just now, sorry. I always used a edited version of one of the other pinky-meshes.&#13;
<br/><br/>
By the way, if you want to see the scene with the two security guys and the scientist that bumps into one of them, put this into your scene.txt (instead of all the other modelstuff there):&#13;

<br /><br />The only data that is built upon loading a md5 model for stencil shadowing is an edge-list. An edge is a struct that has two vertex-indices, two triangle-indices and a bool that will hold the information of wether it´s a silhouette edge or not.
<br /><br />Doom3´s models are not necessarily closed, so there can be edges that have only one triangle (usually they have two). Such a "one-winged" edge is a silhouette-edge if its triangle faces the light. Normal "two-winged" edges are silhouette edges if one triangle faces the light and the other one doesn´t.
<br /><br />To get the edge-list, a more complicated approach is needed than what is described in the gamasutra article (Kilgard´s paper doesn´t describe the edge creation process at all). But you will want to read that gamasutra article first because it makes it easier to understand why the following algorithm works for non-closed meshes.
<br />You have to go through the triangles in two passes. First, collect the edges where the first vertex has a lower index than the second one, and create an edge entry for each of those (ignore the others). Then you have to go through the triangles again and look for edges where the first vertex has a higher number than the second one. If that edge has been found in the first pass, then you have just found the second triangle of a two-winged edge. If that edge has not been found in the first pass, then you have found a one-winged edge. At the end of the second pass you may have edges that have been found in the first pass but not in the second, these are one-winged, too. 
<br /><br />The model is "open" along those one-winged edges, and my viewer shows them in the "geometry debug" mode as thick yellow lines.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p22030" date="Posted: Tue Apr 20, 2004 3:36 pm "><author>KPixel</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">So, you don't do any "correction" of the IB ?!?

<br />Yes the viewer does analyze and correct (if necessary) the topology of the mesh. That´s necessary because of the reorganization for tangent-space bumpmapping anyway (vertices have to be duplicated at the symmetry-seam, and duplicated vertices that are not located at the seam have to be welded). But you asked what my viewer does in preparation for the stencil shadowing. And the edge list creation is the only thing in that regard, and I will not post all the other load-time initialization code.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20071110115948im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /><br /><br />Yours is not an efficient way to store the edge data for shadowing. You don´t end up with a list of edges, but just with "tri-edges", that is edges that belong to a triangle. One and the same edge is represented multiple times, in each triangle that uses that edge (usually two). But edges in the shadowing kind of sense are a thing of their own.
<br />You want to have a quick way to determine the silhouette of an object. The silhouette is a collection of edges (pairs of vertices, basically), a sub-collection of all the edges of the model. Your representation of edges is unefficient because they are stored within the triangles, but an edge can belong to more than one triangle, and thus shouldn´t be stored like that.
<br /><br />Here´s how the viewer does it. The result of a call to <span style="font-style: italic">createedgelist </span>is a filled <span style="font-style: italic">edgelist[meshnumber]</span>. An <span style="font-style: italic">edge </span>is a struct that contains two vertex-indices, two triangle-indices and a bool that flags that the edge is a silhouette edge.

<br /><br />How the viewer uses that edgelist at runtime should be self-explanatory if you have understood stencil-shadowing. First, for each triangle we do a light-test (tri-normal dot L), so that each triangle knows whether it faces the light or not. Then we determine the silhouette edges, by looking at the two tris of an edge (or only one for one-winged edges). The result is that the <span style="font-style: italic">silhouette</span> boolean members of the edges get filled. Then we´re ready to draw the shadow volumes.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p22065" date="Posted: Wed Apr 21, 2004 1:32 pm "><author>KPixel</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">der_ton wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">What´s an "IB"?</div><br /><br />"IB" means "Index Buffer"; it's the name used by DirectX to call the list of indices...<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">der_ton wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">But you asked what my viewer does in preparation for the stencil shadowing.

<br /><br />Yeah the realloc can kill performance (<span style="font-weight: bold">startup time </span>performance that is), but I think it allocates a little more space to prevent exactly that problem. It´s not really that bad and I was too lazy to precalculate the number of edges.
<br />BTW, an even faster way (and easier to implement) would be to allocate enough space to hold numtris*3 edges (the theoretical maximum number of edges), then fill up the edgelist, and in the end, when we know the actual number of edges, realloc that memory with that (smaller) size.

<br /><br />Yes, It doesn't show them...
<br /><br />Try the file "models/weapons/impfireball/anims/tumble.md5mesh"
<br />You will see a "little" problem with "one-winged" edge...
<br />You can see the biggest square when you rotate at right (that's not a problem because you just need to turn of the culling to see always see it).
<br />But if you move the light in the other side, the shadow of this square doesn't show up (it is only visible in the first side...) <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20071110115948im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /><br /><br />That's probably why I have "holes" between parts of the body; that's where "one-winged" edges are located.

<br /><br />Do you really think it is more CPU work? Most of the work is at startup as you have said.
<br /><br />I think computing those vectors and averaging (smoothing) them every frame requieres much more CPU power than just transforming them with the bones' rotation matrices (no translation, as done with the vertex position).
<br /><br />But what bothers me is: what is the <span style="font-weight: bold">right</span> way to add together the rotations of the multiple weights that affect the vertex. Maybe something like this?
<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">// Per vertex<br />vertex.tangent = vector3::zero;<br />vector3 vec;<br />for( int i = 0; i &lt; vertex.numweights; i++ )<br />{<br />  weight = A weight affecting this vertex<br />  bone = The bone this weight is attached to<br />  vec = bone.rotationMatrix.transform(vertex.originalTangent);<br />  vertex.tangent += vec * weight.bias;<br />}<br />vertex.tangent.normalize();<br /></div>
<br /><br />Doing the same to normals and binormals (I dont compute the binormal in the vertex shader).

<br /><br />I´m not sure about that either. If you tested your idea, let me know about the result. One issue I´m spotting: 
<br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">vec = bone.rotationMatrix.transform(vertex.originalTangent); </div><br />That transformation matrix used here would not simply be the animated matrix of the bone, but it would be the matrix that rotates the bindmat into the animated matrix.

Store these "bone-space tangent space vectors".<br />At runtime, calculate the weighted sum of these bone-space tangentspace vectors by the animated bone matrices.<br />I´m almost sure that is more expensive than calculating the tangentspace from scratch.

<br /><br />This is what i'm doing:
<br /><br />- Computing tangent space vectors from bind position at startup.
<br />- For each bone, saving the inverse of the bind rotation matrix ("invBindMatrix"), at startup too.
<br />- When preparing the animated bones, in adittion to the matrix used to rotate vertices ("vertMatrix"), i compute another matrix that I can use to rotate tangent space vectors ("tangMatrix = invBindMatrix * vertMatrix"). As der_ton noted, we must undo the original rotations of the space where the tangent vectors were created in the first place, before doing the usual rotations of the animations.
<br />- Vertex position is rotated with vertMatrix, and tangent space vectors with tangMatrix, averaging between the several weights affecting the vertex.
<br />- Done <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20071110115948im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />I found hard to determine what is faster:
<br /><br />Pre-computed tangent space vectors:
<br />- One more matrix multiplication (invBindMatrix * vertMatrix) per bone.
<br />- Three more vector rotations (normal, binormal, tangent) per vertex(alright, for each weight affecting the vertex <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20071110115948im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />).
<br /><br />Tangent space vectors computed per frame, with pre-computed smooth groups:
<br />- A good amount of vector math to get the tangent and the binormal, per vertex. Then adding the vector to the associated smooth group. (*)
<br />- Normalizing vectors for each smooth group, then copying to each vertex.
<br /><br />I'm using an old and slow Duron processor (it does work!!... with the help of a Radeon 9600 pro <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20071110115948im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />), and that's why I care much about it.
<br /><br />(*) der_ton, could you tell me how much do you do here?
<br />I must confess that I'm (temporally) using the nvidia mesh mender library for the task after getting frustated with my first attempts of doing it by myself. (looser)
<br /><br /><br />------------------
<br /><br />Anyway, my animations are not perfect.
<br /><br />An unofficial MD5 specifications file says "if you are half way between the start and end time, you are also half way through the keys", so I'm getting the key index with this:
<br /><br />float keyTime = ((currentTime - channel.startTime) / (channel.endTime - channel.startTime)) * (float)channel.numKeys;
<br />int keyIndex = (int)keyTime;
<br /><br />I have disabled any attempt of interpolation between keys until I get the animations going on fine.
<br /><br />I think my problem has to do with the channel frame rate and range values, because I haven't found a use for them yet <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20071110115948im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p22237" date="Posted: Sun Apr 25, 2004 12:06 pm "><author>der_ton</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">That unofficial md5 specification is wrong. I will post some info on that keyframe range thing soon, it´s going to be in that "details about md5anim" thread.
<br /><br />The per vertex tangentspace calculation is a bit complicated in my viewer. I had a problem with that before, and then around christmas I decided to redesign the whole thing and that also resulted in a 200-300% speed gain.
<br /><br />To make it short, at loadtime I determine vertices that need to be cloned (because of discontinuity of tangentspace at some vertices). Then a table is made that stores for each triangle, which vertices receive the triangle´s normal and tangent/binormal (these are two different things, because cloned vertices receive the normal, but not necessarily the tangentspace vectors. If you want to put it that way, you end up with different kinds of smoothing groups for normals or for tangentspace). 
<br />At runtime, first the normals and tangentspace vectors for the triangles are calculated. Then they are distributed to the vertices according to the precalculated tables.
<br />Then the normals are normalized, and binormals and tangents are normalized and made perpendicular to the normal.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p22355" date="Posted: Thu Apr 29, 2004 3:37 pm "><author>der_ton</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Mig wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">An unofficial MD5 specifications file says "if you are half way between the start and end time, you are also half way through the keys", so I'm getting the key index with this:<br /><br />float keyTime = ((currentTime - channel.startTime) / (channel.endTime - channel.startTime)) * (float)channel.numKeys;<br />int keyIndex = (int)keyTime;<br /></div>

<br /><br />In some cases, the shader names do not correspond with the tga names (because the shader references the tgas in the .mtr files). The modelviewer doesn't read these .mtr files, and some textures will not display unless you modify the shader in the md5 file (make a copy and edit it with a text editor).</div>]]></body></post><post id="p44705" date="Posted: Tue Aug 31, 2004 8:57 am "><author>DaNg3R</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">tnx 1k <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8)" title="Cool" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p52473" date="Posted: Wed Sep 22, 2004 2:33 pm "><author>CHaSE</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">

Yup that's the way I use it too. Without it, I would get grey hairs developing the max exporter.&#13;

Checking the model in Doom3 takes alot longer because of the loadtimes, and there's other stuff that can go wrong, like entity defs and all that...<br/>_________________<br/><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/" target="_blank" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/site/img/d3w.gif" border="0"/> Staff</a>&#13;

In order to find out which tga that is, you have to first look up the material definition of that shader (in one of the material files, for monsters its monsters.mtr).</div>]]></body></post><post id="p41696" date="Posted: Wed Aug 25, 2004 4:58 pm "><author>Giggione</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">A littel question?

The program is use to demo the bumpmap, perpixel lighting via real-time 3D graphics&#13;
<br/><br/>
=== 3D Graphics technology ===&#13;
<br/>
1. shadow-volume&#13;
<br/>
2. many dynamic lights, and single ambient light&#13;
<br/>
3. bumpmap with diffuse and specular map&#13;
<br/>
4. Support 3D model by md5mesh format (used in DOOM3), and md5anim animation file&#13;
<br/>
5. Support 3D model by ASE format (3DSMAX ASE file export)&#13;
<br/><br/>
=== System requirement ===&#13;
<br/>
* Windows XP/2000/98/ME Traditional Chinese with OpenGL 1.3 ICD&#13;
<br/>
* 3D card:&#13;
<br/>
     nVidia Geforce Card from Geforce/Geforce2/2MX/3Ti/4200Ti or later&#13;
<br/>
     ATi Radeon 7x00/8500/9x00 or later&#13;
<br/>
-----------------------------------------&#13;
<br/>
I use some render-path for different Graphics cards:&#13;
<br/><span style="font-style: italic">2 texture-units card: use alpha buffer to temporary store bumpmap, then blend with diffuse and do specular pass</span>&#13;
<br/><span style="font-style: italic">4 texture-units card: render-path for specular pass via ATi and nVidia</span>&#13;
<br/><br/>
I read many useful posts here, and write the program.&#13;
<br/>
Any comment is welcome.&#13;
<br/><br/>
ps: The file is located on geocities, data transfer quota is limited.&#13;

About projected spotlights, just bind it in 4th texUnit&#13;
<br/><span style="text-decoration: underline">tex#0</span>: NormalMap&#13;
<br/><span style="text-decoration: underline">tex#1</span>: Cubemap for NormalMap&#13;

<br/>
For 2 texUnits card:&#13;
<br/>
Need more twice pass as above. &#13;
<br/>
tex#0,#1 at first pass to alpha-buffer&#13;
<br/>
tex#2,#3 at second pass to blend with alpha-buffer.&#13;
<br/>
Then do again for specularmap&#13;

About Cull, sure! Mesh would be culled if outside light's frustum or outside camera's frustum.&#13;
<br/><br/>
I also have many improvement to do in the future. Such as:&#13;
<br/>
a. use fragment program to do single pass(w/diffuse, specular) per light &#13;
<br/>
b. use two-side stencil (UltraShadow via nVidia)&#13;
<br/>
c. use vertex program&#13;
<br/>
d. etc...<br/>_________________<br/>Macbear Chen 麥克熊</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

You will have to extract the textures from pak002.pk4, and then edit the "shader" lines in a .md5mesh file to point directly to the correct textures.&#13;

There are a couple of explanations on page 4 of this thread, too.

<br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.geocities.com/macbearchen/data/md5mesh.jpg" alt="Image" /><br />The program is use to demo the bumpmap, perpixel lighting via real-time 3D graphics
<br /><br />=== 3D Graphics technology ===
<br />1. shadow-volume
<br />2. many dynamic lights, and single ambient light
<br />3. bumpmap with diffuse and specular map
<br />4. Support 3D model by md5mesh format (used in DOOM3), and md5anim animation file
<br />5. Support 3D model by ASE format (3DSMAX ASE file export)
<br /><br />=== System requirement ===
<br />* Windows XP/2000/98/ME Traditional Chinese with OpenGL 1.3 ICD
<br />* 3D card:
<br />     nVidia Geforce Card from Geforce/Geforce2/2MX/3Ti/4200Ti or later
<br />     ATi Radeon 7x00/8500/9x00 or later
<br />-----------------------------------------
<br />I use some render-path for different Graphics cards:
<br /><span style="font-style: italic">2 texture-units card: use alpha buffer to temporary store bumpmap, then blend with diffuse and do specular pass</span>
<br /><span style="font-style: italic">4 texture-units card: render-path for specular pass via ATi and nVidia</span>
<br /><br />I read many useful posts here, and write the program.
<br />Any comment is welcome.
<br /><br />ps: The file is located on geocities, data transfer quota is limited.
<br />     So if you can't download it right now, try again later.

<br /><br />I have to suggest some new features for der_ton model viewer to improve a better workflow when you work with it.
<br /><br />*  priority
<br />** secondary 
<br /><br />-=Workflow=-
<br /><br />*
<br />- Read config model in def files for quick navigation between model's sequences. 
<br />- Display names of bones in a short list dialog to select bones and highlightning the bone selected in viewport's model viewer, i suggest a new tab called Bones. 
<br /><br />**
<br />- Move to player view for better preview weapons animation.
<br /><br /><br />-=Render=-
<br /><br />*
<br />- Sketch render (uniform lightning) like this : 
<br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://redeye.free.fr/sketch_view.jpg" alt="Image" /><br />- Hide geometry for better understanding rigging model (bones only)
<br /><br />**
<br />- Display influence Bones (weight map)
<br /><br /><br />-=Textures=-
<br /><br />**
<br />- New Materials tab to display model's texture on model viewer viewport.
<br /><br /><br />If you have any other suggest for improve model viewer you can post it here =)
<br /><br />Bye!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p114647" date="Posted: Sun Oct 02, 2005 2:03 am "><author>Yak</author><body><![CDATA[<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>

<br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.geocities.com/macbearchen/data/md5mesh.jpg" alt="Image" /><br />The program is use to demo the bumpmap, perpixel lighting via real-time 3D graphics
<br /><br />=== 3D Graphics technology ===
<br />1. shadow-volume
<br />2. many dynamic lights, and single ambient light
<br />3. bumpmap with diffuse and specular map
<br />4. Support 3D model by md5mesh format (used in DOOM3), and md5anim animation file
<br />5. Support 3D model by ASE format (3DSMAX ASE file export)
<br /><br />=== System requirement ===
<br />* Windows XP/2000/98/ME Traditional Chinese with OpenGL 1.3 ICD
<br />* 3D card:
<br />     nVidia Geforce Card from Geforce/Geforce2/2MX/3Ti/4200Ti or later
<br />     ATi Radeon 7x00/8500/9x00 or later
<br />-----------------------------------------
<br />I use some render-path for different Graphics cards:
<br /><span style="font-style: italic">2 texture-units card: use alpha buffer to temporary store bumpmap, then blend with diffuse and do specular pass</span>
<br /><span style="font-style: italic">4 texture-units card: render-path for specular pass via ATi and nVidia</span>
<br /><br />I read many useful posts here, and write the program.
<br />Any comment is welcome.
<br /><br />ps: The file is located on geocities, data transfer quota is limited.
<br />     So if you can't download it right now, try again later. Sorry...</div>

						<div class="postbody">Nice work, macbearchen!
<br />And it's a bit faster than my viewer. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br />About the system requirements: it worked for me even though I don't have a Traditional Chinese Windows. Maybe there's some nonstandard font necessary that I happen to have installed.
<br /><br />What's your render method for projected spotlights? Do you cull geometry that's outside of the light's frustum?</div>

<br />About projected spotlights, just bind it in 4th texUnit
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">tex#0</span>: NormalMap
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">tex#1</span>: Cubemap for NormalMap
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">tex#2</span>: Diffusemap (then Specularmap at second pass)
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">tex#3</span>: 2D Spotlights map (3D tex is workable if you care about vertical attenuation by light)
<br />For 2 texUnits card:
<br />Need more twice pass as above. 
<br />tex#0,#1 at first pass to alpha-buffer
<br />tex#2,#3 at second pass to blend with alpha-buffer.
<br />Then do again for specularmap
<br /><br />About Cull, sure! Mesh would be culled if outside light's frustum or outside camera's frustum.
<br /><br />I also have many improvement to do in the future. Such as:
<br />a. use fragment program to do single pass(w/diffuse, specular) per light 
<br />b. use two-side stencil (UltraShadow via nVidia)
<br />c. use vertex program
<br />d. etc...</div>

						<div class="postbody">Doom3 uses a material system to get the correct look and the location of the texture files. My viewer doesn't, for simplicity's sake.
<br /><br />You will have to extract the textures from pak002.pk4, and then edit the "shader" lines in a .md5mesh file to point directly to the correct textures.
<br /><br />There are a couple of explanations on page 4 of this thread, too. I hope that helps.</div>

<br />Can you tell me which LWO, and maybe take a screenshot? I did a bit of testing and most objects looked ok, with a few minor issues with the symmetry seam or discontinuous texturing.</div>

						<div class="postbody">Actually, I made a custom *.LWO for use with the material editor and that was the model I tested the your new modelviewer with.

						<div class="postbody">Hi all!
<br /><br />I have to suggest some new features for der_ton model viewer to improve a better workflow when you work with it.
<br /><br />*  priority
<br />** secondary 
<br /><br />-=Workflow=-
<br /><br />*
<br />- Read config model in def files for quick navigation between model's sequences. 
<br />- Display names of bones in a short list dialog to select bones and highlightning the bone selected in viewport's model viewer, i suggest a new tab called Bones. 
<br /><br />**
<br />- Move to player view for better preview weapons animation.
<br /><br /><br />-=Render=-
<br /><br />*
<br />- Sketch render (uniform lightning) like this : 
<br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://redeye.free.fr/sketch_view.jpg" alt="Image" /><br />- Hide geometry for better understanding rigging model (bones only)
<br /><br />**
<br />- Display influence Bones (weight map)
<br /><br /><br />-=Textures=-
<br /><br />**
<br />- New Materials tab to display model's texture on model viewer viewport.
<br /><br /><br />If you have any other suggest for improve model viewer you can post it here =)

<br /><br />=== 3D Graphics technology ===
<br />1. shadow-volume
<br />2. many dynamic lights, and single ambient light
<br />3. bumpmap with diffuse and specular map
<br />4. Support 3D model by md5mesh format (used in DOOM3), and md5anim animation file
<br />5. Support 3D model by ASE format (3DSMAX ASE file export)
<br /><br />=== System requirement ===
<br />* Windows XP/2000/98/ME Traditional Chinese with OpenGL 1.3 ICD
<br />* 3D card:
<br />     nVidia Geforce Card from Geforce/Geforce2/2MX/3Ti/4200Ti or later
<br />     ATi Radeon 7x00/8500/9x00 or later
<br />-----------------------------------------
<br />I use some render-path for different Graphics cards:
<br /><span style="font-style: italic">2 texture-units card: use alpha buffer to temporary store bumpmap, then blend with diffuse and do specular pass</span>
<br /><span style="font-style: italic">4 texture-units card: render-path for specular pass via ATi and nVidia</span>
<br /><br />I read many useful posts here, and write the program.
<br />Any comment is welcome.
<br /><br />ps: The file is located on geocities, data transfer quota is limited.
<br />     So if you can't download it right now, try again later.

You could read "readme.txt" about English usage of my program.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">What's your render method for projected spotlights? Do you cull geometry that's outside of the light's frustum?</div>
<br />About projected spotlights, just bind it in 4th texUnit
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">tex#0</span>: NormalMap
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">tex#1</span>: Cubemap for NormalMap
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">tex#2</span>: Diffusemap (then Specularmap at second pass)
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">tex#3</span>: 2D Spotlights map (3D tex is workable if you care about vertical attenuation by light)
<br />For 2 texUnits card:
<br />Need more twice pass as above. 
<br />tex#0,#1 at first pass to alpha-buffer
<br />tex#2,#3 at second pass to blend with alpha-buffer.
<br />Then do again for specularmap
<br /><br />About Cull, sure! Mesh would be culled if outside light's frustum or outside camera's frustum.
<br /><br />I also have many improvement to do in the future. Such as:
<br />a. use fragment program to do single pass(w/diffuse, specular) per light 
<br />b. use two-side stencil (UltraShadow via nVidia)
<br />c. use vertex program
<br />d. etc...</div>]]></body></post><post id="p102788" date="Posted: Wed Jul 06, 2005 9:06 pm "><author>DiamondDave23</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I MAY SOUND STUPID BUT IM TRYING TO CREATE CUTSCENES FOR MY NEW MAP USING der_TONS  MOD VIEWER AND I CAN LOAD THE MD5 MESH MODEL OF THE Doom 3 Marine but his texture isnt there whats the problem</div>]]></body></post><post id="p102841" date="Posted: Thu Jul 07, 2005 7:57 am "><author>der_ton</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Doom3 uses a material system to get the correct look and the location of the texture files.

<br /><br />I have to suggest some new features for der_ton model viewer to improve a better workflow when you work with it.
<br /><br />*  priority
<br />** secondary 
<br /><br />-=Workflow=-
<br /><br />*
<br />- Read config model in def files for quick navigation between model's sequences. 
<br />- Display names of bones in a short list dialog to select bones and highlightning the bone selected in viewport's model viewer, i suggest a new tab called Bones. 
<br /><br />**
<br />- Move to player view for better preview weapons animation.
<br /><br /><br />-=Render=-
<br /><br />*
<br />- Sketch render (uniform lightning) like this : 
<br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://redeye.free.fr/sketch_view.jpg" alt="Image" /><br />- Hide geometry for better understanding rigging model (bones only)
<br /><br />**
<br />- Display influence Bones (weight map)
<br /><br /><br />-=Textures=-
<br /><br />**
<br />- New Materials tab to display model's texture on model viewer viewport.
<br /><br /><br />If you have any other suggest for improve model viewer you can post it here =)

						<div class="postbody">when i load it the model either looks black or looks wierd and choppy, like u see random triangles being ignored by the lighting. One way or another it never really looks like rendering the normal map.

						<div class="postbody">Hi, I also write a md5mesh viewer at
<br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.geocities.com/macbearchen/data/md5mesh_macbear.zip" class="postlink">md5mesh_macbear.zip</a>
<br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.geocities.com/macbearchen/data/md5mesh.jpg" alt="Image" /><br />The program is use to demo the bumpmap, perpixel lighting via real-time 3D graphics
<br /><br />=== 3D Graphics technology ===
<br />1. shadow-volume
<br />2. many dynamic lights, and single ambient light
<br />3. bumpmap with diffuse and specular map
<br />4. Support 3D model by md5mesh format (used in DOOM3), and md5anim animation file
<br />5. Support 3D model by ASE format (3DSMAX ASE file export)
<br /><br />=== System requirement ===
<br />* Windows XP/2000/98/ME Traditional Chinese with OpenGL 1.3 ICD
<br />* 3D card:
<br />     nVidia Geforce Card from Geforce/Geforce2/2MX/3Ti/4200Ti or later
<br />     ATi Radeon 7x00/8500/9x00 or later
<br />-----------------------------------------
<br />I use some render-path for different Graphics cards:
<br /><span style="font-style: italic">2 texture-units card: use alpha buffer to temporary store bumpmap, then blend with diffuse and do specular pass</span>
<br /><span style="font-style: italic">4 texture-units card: render-path for specular pass via ATi and nVidia</span>
<br /><br />I read many useful posts here, and write the program.
<br />Any comment is welcome.
<br /><br />ps: The file is located on geocities, data transfer quota is limited.
<br />     So if you can't download it right now, try again later. Sorry...</div>

						<div class="postbody">Nice work, macbearchen!
<br />And it's a bit faster than my viewer. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br />About the system requirements: it worked for me even though I don't have a Traditional Chinese Windows. Maybe there's some nonstandard font necessary that I happen to have installed.
<br /><br />What's your render method for projected spotlights? Do you cull geometry that's outside of the light's frustum?</div>

Do you cull geometry that's outside of the light's frustum?</div>
<br />About projected spotlights, just bind it in 4th texUnit
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">tex#0</span>: NormalMap
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">tex#1</span>: Cubemap for NormalMap
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">tex#2</span>: Diffusemap (then Specularmap at second pass)
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">tex#3</span>: 2D Spotlights map (3D tex is workable if you care about vertical attenuation by light)
<br />For 2 texUnits card:
<br />Need more twice pass as above. 
<br />tex#0,#1 at first pass to alpha-buffer
<br />tex#2,#3 at second pass to blend with alpha-buffer.
<br />Then do again for specularmap
<br /><br />About Cull, sure! Mesh would be culled if outside light's frustum or outside camera's frustum.
<br /><br />I also have many improvement to do in the future. Such as:
<br />a. use fragment program to do single pass(w/diffuse, specular) per light 
<br />b. use two-side stencil (UltraShadow via nVidia)
<br />c. use vertex program
<br />d. etc...</div>

						<div class="postbody">Doom3 uses a material system to get the correct look and the location of the texture files. My viewer doesn't, for simplicity's sake.
<br /><br />You will have to extract the textures from pak002.pk4, and then edit the "shader" lines in a .md5mesh file to point directly to the correct textures.
<br /><br />There are a couple of explanations on page 4 of this thread, too. I hope that helps.</div>

<br />Can you tell me which LWO, and maybe take a screenshot? I did a bit of testing and most objects looked ok, with a few minor issues with the symmetry seam or discontinuous texturing.</div>

						<div class="postbody">Actually, I made a custom *.LWO for use with the material editor and that was the model I tested the your new modelviewer with.
<br /><br />I'll send it VIA email.
<br /><br />Just keep in mind that the model has a dummy shader name. There wasn't much point in creating a material shader for a model that was just going to display whatever material is selected in the material editor.</div>

						<div class="postbody">Hi all!
<br /><br />I have to suggest some new features for der_ton model viewer to improve a better workflow when you work with it.
<br /><br />*  priority
<br />** secondary 
<br /><br />-=Workflow=-
<br /><br />*
<br />- Read config model in def files for quick navigation between model's sequences. 
<br />- Display names of bones in a short list dialog to select bones and highlightning the bone selected in viewport's model viewer, i suggest a new tab called Bones. 
<br /><br />**
<br />- Move to player view for better preview weapons animation.
<br /><br /><br />-=Render=-
<br /><br />*
<br />- Sketch render (uniform lightning) like this : 
<br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://redeye.free.fr/sketch_view.jpg" alt="Image" /><br />- Hide geometry for better understanding rigging model (bones only)
<br /><br />**
<br />- Display influence Bones (weight map)
<br /><br /><br />-=Textures=-
<br /><br />**
<br />- New Materials tab to display model's texture on model viewer viewport.
<br /><br /><br />If you have any other suggest for improve model viewer you can post it here =)
<br /><br />Bye!</div>

<br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.geocities.com/macbearchen/data/md5mesh.jpg" alt="Image" /><br />The program is use to demo the bumpmap, perpixel lighting via real-time 3D graphics
<br /><br />=== 3D Graphics technology ===
<br />1. shadow-volume
<br />2. many dynamic lights, and single ambient light
<br />3. bumpmap with diffuse and specular map
<br />4. Support 3D model by md5mesh format (used in DOOM3), and md5anim animation file
<br />5. Support 3D model by ASE format (3DSMAX ASE file export)
<br /><br />=== System requirement ===
<br />* Windows XP/2000/98/ME Traditional Chinese with OpenGL 1.3 ICD
<br />* 3D card:
<br />     nVidia Geforce Card from Geforce/Geforce2/2MX/3Ti/4200Ti or later
<br />     ATi Radeon 7x00/8500/9x00 or later
<br />-----------------------------------------
<br />I use some render-path for different Graphics cards:
<br /><span style="font-style: italic">2 texture-units card: use alpha buffer to temporary store bumpmap, then blend with diffuse and do specular pass</span>
<br /><span style="font-style: italic">4 texture-units card: render-path for specular pass via ATi and nVidia</span>
<br /><br />I read many useful posts here, and write the program.
<br />Any comment is welcome.
<br /><br />ps: The file is located on geocities, data transfer quota is limited.
<br />     So if you can't download it right now, try again later.

You could read "readme.txt" about English usage of my program.<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">What's your render method for projected spotlights? Do you cull geometry that's outside of the light's frustum?</div>
<br />About projected spotlights, just bind it in 4th texUnit
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">tex#0</span>: NormalMap
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">tex#1</span>: Cubemap for NormalMap
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">tex#2</span>: Diffusemap (then Specularmap at second pass)
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">tex#3</span>: 2D Spotlights map (3D tex is workable if you care about vertical attenuation by light)
<br />For 2 texUnits card:
<br />Need more twice pass as above. 
<br />tex#0,#1 at first pass to alpha-buffer
<br />tex#2,#3 at second pass to blend with alpha-buffer.
<br />Then do again for specularmap
<br /><br />About Cull, sure! Mesh would be culled if outside light's frustum or outside camera's frustum.
<br /><br />I also have many improvement to do in the future. Such as:
<br />a. use fragment program to do single pass(w/diffuse, specular) per light 
<br />b. use two-side stencil (UltraShadow via nVidia)
<br />c. use vertex program
<br />d. etc...</div>]]></body></post><post id="p102788" date="Posted: Wed Jul 06, 2005 9:06 pm "><author>DiamondDave23</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I MAY SOUND STUPID BUT IM TRYING TO CREATE CUTSCENES FOR MY NEW MAP USING der_TONS  MOD VIEWER AND I CAN LOAD THE MD5 MESH MODEL OF THE Doom 3 Marine but his texture isnt there whats the problem</div>]]></body></post><post id="p102841" date="Posted: Thu Jul 07, 2005 7:57 am "><author>der_ton</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Doom3 uses a material system to get the correct look and the location of the texture files.

<br /><br />*
<br />- Read config model in def files for quick navigation between model's sequences. 
<br />- Display names of bones in a short list dialog to select bones and highlightning the bone selected in viewport's model viewer, i suggest a new tab called Bones. 
<br /><br />**
<br />- Move to player view for better preview weapons animation.
<br /><br /><br />-=Render=-
<br /><br />*
<br />- Sketch render (uniform lightning) like this :

<br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.geocities.com/macbearchen/data/md5mesh_macbear.zip" class="postlink">md5mesh_macbear.zip</a>
<br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.geocities.com/macbearchen/data/md5mesh.jpg" alt="Image" /><br />The program is use to demo the bumpmap, perpixel lighting via real-time 3D graphics
<br /><br />=== 3D Graphics technology ===
<br />1. shadow-volume
<br />2. many dynamic lights, and single ambient light
<br />3. bumpmap with diffuse and specular map
<br />4. Support 3D model by md5mesh format (used in DOOM3), and md5anim animation file
<br />5. Support 3D model by ASE format (3DSMAX ASE file export)
<br /><br />=== System requirement ===
<br />* Windows XP/2000/98/ME Traditional Chinese with OpenGL 1.3 ICD
<br />* 3D card:
<br />     nVidia Geforce Card from Geforce/Geforce2/2MX/3Ti/4200Ti or later
<br />     ATi Radeon 7x00/8500/9x00 or later
<br />-----------------------------------------
<br />I use some render-path for different Graphics cards:
<br /><span style="font-style: italic">2 texture-units card: use alpha buffer to temporary store bumpmap, then blend with diffuse and do specular pass</span>
<br /><span style="font-style: italic">4 texture-units card: render-path for specular pass via ATi and nVidia</span>
<br /><br />I read many useful posts here, and write the program.
<br />Any comment is welcome.
<br /><br />ps: The file is located on geocities, data transfer quota is limited.
<br />     So if you can't download it right now, try again later. Sorry...</div>

						<div class="postbody">Nice work, macbearchen!
<br />And it's a bit faster than my viewer. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br />About the system requirements: it worked for me even though I don't have a Traditional Chinese Windows. Maybe there's some nonstandard font necessary that I happen to have installed.
<br /><br />What's your render method for projected spotlights? Do you cull geometry that's outside of the light's frustum?</div>

Do you cull geometry that's outside of the light's frustum?</div>
<br />About projected spotlights, just bind it in 4th texUnit
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">tex#0</span>: NormalMap
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">tex#1</span>: Cubemap for NormalMap
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">tex#2</span>: Diffusemap (then Specularmap at second pass)
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">tex#3</span>: 2D Spotlights map (3D tex is workable if you care about vertical attenuation by light)
<br />For 2 texUnits card:
<br />Need more twice pass as above. 
<br />tex#0,#1 at first pass to alpha-buffer
<br />tex#2,#3 at second pass to blend with alpha-buffer.
<br />Then do again for specularmap
<br /><br />About Cull, sure! Mesh would be culled if outside light's frustum or outside camera's frustum.
<br /><br />I also have many improvement to do in the future. Such as:
<br />a. use fragment program to do single pass(w/diffuse, specular) per light 
<br />b. use two-side stencil (UltraShadow via nVidia)
<br />c. use vertex program
<br />d. etc...</div>

						<div class="postbody">Doom3 uses a material system to get the correct look and the location of the texture files. My viewer doesn't, for simplicity's sake.
<br /><br />You will have to extract the textures from pak002.pk4, and then edit the "shader" lines in a .md5mesh file to point directly to the correct textures.
<br /><br />There are a couple of explanations on page 4 of this thread, too. I hope that helps.</div>

<br />Can you tell me which LWO, and maybe take a screenshot? I did a bit of testing and most objects looked ok, with a few minor issues with the symmetry seam or discontinuous texturing.</div>

						<div class="postbody">Actually, I made a custom *.LWO for use with the material editor and that was the model I tested the your new modelviewer with.
<br /><br />I'll send it VIA email.
<br /><br />Just keep in mind that the model has a dummy shader name. There wasn't much point in creating a material shader for a model that was just going to display whatever material is selected in the material editor.</div>

						<div class="postbody">Hi all!
<br /><br />I have to suggest some new features for der_ton model viewer to improve a better workflow when you work with it.
<br /><br />*  priority
<br />** secondary 
<br /><br />-=Workflow=-
<br /><br />*
<br />- Read config model in def files for quick navigation between model's sequences. 
<br />- Display names of bones in a short list dialog to select bones and highlightning the bone selected in viewport's model viewer, i suggest a new tab called Bones. 
<br /><br />**
<br />- Move to player view for better preview weapons animation.
<br /><br /><br />-=Render=-
<br /><br />*
<br />- Sketch render (uniform lightning) like this : 
<br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://redeye.free.fr/sketch_view.jpg" alt="Image" /><br />- Hide geometry for better understanding rigging model (bones only)
<br /><br />**
<br />- Display influence Bones (weight map)
<br /><br /><br />-=Textures=-
<br /><br />**
<br />- New Materials tab to display model's texture on model viewer viewport.
<br /><br /><br />If you have any other suggest for improve model viewer you can post it here =)
<br /><br />Bye!</div>
