Perhaps. And if you think less of me for liking it... well fuck you then. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081116125200im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /><br /><br />I'll admit, it only took me about 4 to 5 hours to play though but I've never been one to criticize a game for being short. And if I have to choose between a short but well polished gem and a long drawn out turd, Lost Winds is a great example of what developers can do when duration isn't made a priority.<br /><br />From a gameplay standpoint, it is essentially a simple 2D platformer with some puzzle solving elements. Levels are designed in a fashion similar to metroid where from the very beginning it's clear that some areas are inaccessible and will need revisited.<br /><br />It's beautifully styled and the environments are rich with detail. This would definitely be a source of inspiration for some map making if I had the talent.<br /><br />The thing that really won me over though was how innovative the game was. You move the character around with the joystick, but there is no jump button. You blow gusts of wind at the character to propel him across jumps or over obstacles. And it's largely the same but in reverse with enemies. Blow them into the ceiling, floor, walls.<br /><br />And it doesn't end there. The environment plays a part as well. You can fling boulders around, blow fire from torches, or spray water gathered from streams and pools. There's something appealing about being able to write your name in the sky with fire.<br /><br />My only fault with the game is that it's not challenging. The enemies are disposed of easily. And there are save points and health pickups which are practically rendered useless because you can revive your dying character by simply waving your cursor over him frantically. Perhaps the challenge is supposed to be in solving puzzles but I didn't find them very difficult.<br /><br />That said, I still enjoyed the game very much and think it's well worth the $10 spent.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">spoiler wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><span style="color: #FFFFFF">During the ending they use the "To Be Continued" bit which implies they have a sequel in the works.</span></div><br /><br />I also bought Defend Your Castle for $5...<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081116125200/http://youtube.com/watch?v=4EBKOybfZqI">http://youtube.com/watch?v=4EBKOybfZqI</a><!-- m --><br /><br />... and while it's certainly a fun game it's not as polished as it could be.
