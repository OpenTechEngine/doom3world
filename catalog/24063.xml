You achieved it.<br /><br />It is very nice to have so many combat moves. And it's very fun to accidentally send a monster to fly in the sky or freeze him.<br /><br />And there is a good replay value - to learn and use moves that I missed before.<br /><br />Two things that bothered me - in the town some voice constantly repeats "Help me, help me" all the time. It's annoying to hear the same thing so many times. And I think it would be better to have a menu option to display advanced controls list instead of having to quit the game to look at it. <br /><br />Once again you proved your ability to turn Doom3 into a different great game.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">LDAsh wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I hope this project will find itself a decent mirror soon.

There is a double bind in there for the F1 key.  You can still set this in the menu options.<br /><br />If your running out of ammo too often, try using levitation more often.  You can grab and throw objects, projectiles and small enemies just like in ROE with it.  When your fighting the shock knight or Barons of Hell, throwing the explosive barrels or their own projectiles will make short work of them.<br /><br />Learning the special moves and finishing moves for the Ruin Blade is very useful.  Its the best way to take out small time enemies like zombies, maggots and imps.  Great way to conserve ammo.<br /><br />The Journal key is for the PDA replacement.  However it was never finished.  Nothing happens because the player is never given one in the game.<br /><br />If anyone wants to tinker with some of the new settings, here are the console commands:<br /><br />pm_thirdperson_sidescale<br />This will move the camera from left to right or center it.<br /><br />r_hdr_*<br />Tinkering around with the various HDR settings can improve performance, or the general look of the game.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p228535" date="Posted: Sat Nov 20, 2010 10:12 pm "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Congratulations!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p228558" date="Posted: Mon Nov 22, 2010 12:26 am "><author>Douglas Quaid</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I really enjoyed the beta.

You have to use the interact button (default: E).</div>]]></body></post><post id="p228519" date="Posted: Sat Nov 20, 2010 1:55 pm "><author>NX-317</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">At last, long years of waiting are over.<br /><br />This is exactly what I expected from Atomic Armadillo - well made levels, original design, new and fun gameplay, fantastic sounds and music, especially light.ogg from first level.<br /><br />I see you redesigned the mod few times to achieve the perfect look. You achieved it.<br /><br />It is very nice to have so many combat moves. And it's very fun to accidentally send a monster to fly in the sky or freeze him.<br /><br />And there is a good replay value - to learn and use moves that I missed before.<br /><br />Two things that bothered me - in the town some voice constantly repeats "Help me, help me" all the time. It's annoying to hear the same thing so many times. And I think it would be better to have a menu option to display advanced controls list instead of having to quit the game to look at it. <br /><br />Once again you proved your ability to turn Doom3 into a different great game.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">LDAsh wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I hope this project will find itself a decent mirror soon.

There is a double bind in there for the F1 key.  You can still set this in the menu options.<br /><br />If your running out of ammo too often, try using levitation more often.  You can grab and throw objects, projectiles and small enemies just like in ROE with it.  When your fighting the shock knight or Barons of Hell, throwing the explosive barrels or their own projectiles will make short work of them.<br /><br />Learning the special moves and finishing moves for the Ruin Blade is very useful.  Its the best way to take out small time enemies like zombies, maggots and imps.  Great way to conserve ammo.<br /><br />The Journal key is for the PDA replacement.  However it was never finished.  Nothing happens because the player is never given one in the game.<br /><br />If anyone wants to tinker with some of the new settings, here are the console commands:<br /><br />pm_thirdperson_sidescale<br />This will move the camera from left to right or center it.<br /><br />r_hdr_*<br />Tinkering around with the various HDR settings can improve performance, or the general look of the game.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p228535" date="Posted: Sat Nov 20, 2010 10:12 pm "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Congratulations!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p228558" date="Posted: Mon Nov 22, 2010 12:26 am "><author>Douglas Quaid</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I really enjoyed the beta.

That is, will  there be more than 5 levels? I'm already at level 4 (if you count level 2 as stand-alone).<br /><br />Some comments/reports (it's a beta):<br /><br />- locked doors still make the vanilla Doom 3 computer beep when approached, though they're made of rock<br />- the shuriken thrower makes the Doom 3 SMG sound when readied. Is it intended?<br />- are the two first bosses really meant to be so close in time?<br />- There's that flaming sword standing vertically in level 4. When I approach it, the game suggests me to press "interact". Doing so, it replaced the shotgun I was having, with the bow. When I tried to interact again, it didn't give me back the shotgun.<br />- Indeed that stock Doom 3 "help me" is played too much. At first, I thought it's ominous (you know that demon expansion pack and that monster in it that looks like a caco, right?). But probably not. It was playing more frequently when inside, making me think it's an intensity meter, that something inside was expecting me. Oh well. If it's only an ambient sound, shouldn't it be improved?<br />- Level 4 has those two identical (cloned?) archvile+2maggots rooms. No plan to differentiate them for the final release? <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224172232im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />- generally, I learned not to count on the sword combos too much, but rather on my mobility. If I tried doing a spin attack, those slim zombies could pull a very rapid attack that would take out about 15% of the health. The monsters are still as dangerous as ever... I was also skeptical of poltergeists' (that's what they are?) balance, until I found out they're mostly harmless at melee. I'd say there's a reason the vagary was made a boss by Id, that levitation attack is quite hard to evade.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p228592" date="Posted: Tue Nov 23, 2010 5:21 pm "><author>gb_remake</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I just compiled the D3 gamex86.so on my linux box, just PM me if you wish me to do a test compile of Ruiner.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p228605" date="Posted: Wed Nov 24, 2010 12:15 pm "><author>printz</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Why isn't this thread in the Doom 3 Modifications subforum?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p228606" date="Posted: Wed Nov 24, 2010 1:20 pm "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">printz wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Why isn't this thread in the Doom 3 Modifications subforum?</div><br /><br />Because the author thought it might get more attention in here?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p228616" date="Posted: Thu Nov 25, 2010 5:55 pm "><author>BJA</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">printz wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Why isn't this thread in the Doom 3 Modifications subforum?</div><br />Question is, why this isn`t on the news frontpage...it`s not like a d3 mod gets released every day <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224172232im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />congrats to the beta release btw! <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224172232im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p228621" date="Posted: Fri Nov 26, 2010 12:24 am "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">BJA wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">printz wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Why isn't this thread in the Doom 3 Modifications subforum?</div><br />Question is, why this isn`t on the news frontpage...it`s not like a d3 mod gets released every day <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224172232im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />congrats to the beta release btw! <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224172232im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div><br /><br />True - why isn't it!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p228663" date="Posted: Mon Nov 29, 2010 6:44 pm "><author>mnemjc</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">played trough it just now and overall its quite fun, while not being exactly my setting, so good job so far... however there were a few things i didnt like:<br /><br />1.

You need the whole Ruiner package in your doom3 directory and put the pk4 in there.

There is a double bind in there for the F1 key.  You can still set this in the menu options.<br /><br />If your running out of ammo too often, try using levitation more often.  You can grab and throw objects, projectiles and small enemies just like in ROE with it.  When your fighting the shock knight or Barons of Hell, throwing the explosive barrels or their own projectiles will make short work of them.<br /><br />Learning the special moves and finishing moves for the Ruin Blade is very useful.  Its the best way to take out small time enemies like zombies, maggots and imps.  Great way to conserve ammo.<br /><br />The Journal key is for the PDA replacement.  However it was never finished.  Nothing happens because the player is never given one in the game.<br /><br />If anyone wants to tinker with some of the new settings, here are the console commands:<br /><br />pm_thirdperson_sidescale<br />This will move the camera from left to right or center it.<br /><br />r_hdr_*<br />Tinkering around with the various HDR settings can improve performance, or the general look of the game.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p228535" date="Posted: Sat Nov 20, 2010 10:12 pm "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Congratulations!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p228558" date="Posted: Mon Nov 22, 2010 12:26 am "><author>Douglas Quaid</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I really enjoyed the beta.

I'm already at level 4 (if you count level 2 as stand-alone).<br /><br />Some comments/reports (it's a beta):<br /><br />- locked doors still make the vanilla Doom 3 computer beep when approached, though they're made of rock<br />- the shuriken thrower makes the Doom 3 SMG sound when readied. Is it intended?<br />- are the two first bosses really meant to be so close in time?<br />- There's that flaming sword standing vertically in level 4. When I approach it, the game suggests me to press "interact". Doing so, it replaced the shotgun I was having, with the bow. When I tried to interact again, it didn't give me back the shotgun.<br />- Indeed that stock Doom 3 "help me" is played too much. At first, I thought it's ominous (you know that demon expansion pack and that monster in it that looks like a caco, right?). But probably not. It was playing more frequently when inside, making me think it's an intensity meter, that something inside was expecting me. Oh well. If it's only an ambient sound, shouldn't it be improved?<br />- Level 4 has those two identical (cloned?) archvile+2maggots rooms. No plan to differentiate them for the final release? <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224172232im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />- generally, I learned not to count on the sword combos too much, but rather on my mobility. If I tried doing a spin attack, those slim zombies could pull a very rapid attack that would take out about 15% of the health. The monsters are still as dangerous as ever... I was also skeptical of poltergeists' (that's what they are?) balance, until I found out they're mostly harmless at melee. I'd say there's a reason the vagary was made a boss by Id, that levitation attack is quite hard to evade.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p228592" date="Posted: Tue Nov 23, 2010 5:21 pm "><author>gb_remake</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I just compiled the D3 gamex86.so on my linux box, just PM me if you wish me to do a test compile of Ruiner.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p228605" date="Posted: Wed Nov 24, 2010 12:15 pm "><author>printz</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Why isn't this thread in the Doom 3 Modifications subforum?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p228606" date="Posted: Wed Nov 24, 2010 1:20 pm "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">printz wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Why isn't this thread in the Doom 3 Modifications subforum?</div><br /><br />Because the author thought it might get more attention in here?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p228616" date="Posted: Thu Nov 25, 2010 5:55 pm "><author>BJA</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">printz wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Why isn't this thread in the Doom 3 Modifications subforum?</div><br />Question is, why this isn`t on the news frontpage...it`s not like a d3 mod gets released every day <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224172232im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />congrats to the beta release btw! <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224172232im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p228621" date="Posted: Fri Nov 26, 2010 12:24 am "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">BJA wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">printz wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Why isn't this thread in the Doom 3 Modifications subforum?</div><br />Question is, why this isn`t on the news frontpage...it`s not like a d3 mod gets released every day <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224172232im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />congrats to the beta release btw! <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224172232im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div><br /><br />True - why isn't it!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p228663" date="Posted: Mon Nov 29, 2010 6:44 pm "><author>mnemjc</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">played trough it just now and overall its quite fun, while not being exactly my setting, so good job so far... however there were a few things i didnt like:<br /><br />1. You just get dropped into "your world" without much help/explanations, this might be due the demo not including the real first level?<br />2. Some bosses/enemys seem to be too strong, but this might be because i didn't exactly knew how to pull all these nifty combos off, i just pressed the movement keys randomly while klicking mouse1/mouse2<br /><br />3. a few mapping related issues:<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224172232/http://www.abload.de/image.php?img=shot00004copybl0j.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224172232im_/http://www.abload.de/thumb/shot00004copybl0j.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br />Sorry for the crappy shot. You can get stuck on those skeletons in the second (i think its the second level, shortly before the maledict boss) level, causing you to fly/hang in midair, pressing the move keys lets you "slide" trough, though.<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224172232/http://www.abload.de/image.php?img=shot00005copylajh.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224172232im_/http://www.abload.de/thumb/shot00005copylajh.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br />The bar which should hold the corpse is a little too short.<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224172232/http://www.abload.de/image.php?img=shot00006copyfbqp.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224172232im_/http://www.abload.de/thumb/shot00006copyfbqp.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br />The whole window is zfighting.

You achieved it.<br /><br />It is very nice to have so many combat moves. And it's very fun to accidentally send a monster to fly in the sky or freeze him.<br /><br />And there is a good replay value - to learn and use moves that I missed before.<br /><br />Two things that bothered me - in the town some voice constantly repeats "Help me, help me" all the time. It's annoying to hear the same thing so many times. And I think it would be better to have a menu option to display advanced controls list instead of having to quit the game to look at it. <br /><br />Once again you proved your ability to turn Doom3 into a different great game.<br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">LDAsh wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I hope this project will find itself a decent mirror soon.

There is a double bind in there for the F1 key.  You can still set this in the menu options.<br /><br />If your running out of ammo too often, try using levitation more often.  You can grab and throw objects, projectiles and small enemies just like in ROE with it.  When your fighting the shock knight or Barons of Hell, throwing the explosive barrels or their own projectiles will make short work of them.<br /><br />Learning the special moves and finishing moves for the Ruin Blade is very useful.  Its the best way to take out small time enemies like zombies, maggots and imps.  Great way to conserve ammo.<br /><br />The Journal key is for the PDA replacement.  However it was never finished.  Nothing happens because the player is never given one in the game.<br /><br />If anyone wants to tinker with some of the new settings, here are the console commands:<br /><br />pm_thirdperson_sidescale<br />This will move the camera from left to right or center it.<br /><br />r_hdr_*<br />Tinkering around with the various HDR settings can improve performance, or the general look of the game.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p228535" date="Posted: Sat Nov 20, 2010 10:12 pm "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Congratulations!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p228558" date="Posted: Mon Nov 22, 2010 12:26 am "><author>Douglas Quaid</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I really enjoyed the beta.

That is, will  there be more than 5 levels? I'm already at level 4 (if you count level 2 as stand-alone).<br /><br />Some comments/reports (it's a beta):<br /><br />- locked doors still make the vanilla Doom 3 computer beep when approached, though they're made of rock<br />- the shuriken thrower makes the Doom 3 SMG sound when readied. Is it intended?<br />- are the two first bosses really meant to be so close in time?<br />- There's that flaming sword standing vertically in level 4. When I approach it, the game suggests me to press "interact". Doing so, it replaced the shotgun I was having, with the bow. When I tried to interact again, it didn't give me back the shotgun.<br />- Indeed that stock Doom 3 "help me" is played too much. At first, I thought it's ominous (you know that demon expansion pack and that monster in it that looks like a caco, right?). But probably not. It was playing more frequently when inside, making me think it's an intensity meter, that something inside was expecting me. Oh well. If it's only an ambient sound, shouldn't it be improved?<br />- Level 4 has those two identical (cloned?) archvile+2maggots rooms. No plan to differentiate them for the final release? <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224172232im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />- generally, I learned not to count on the sword combos too much, but rather on my mobility. If I tried doing a spin attack, those slim zombies could pull a very rapid attack that would take out about 15% of the health. The monsters are still as dangerous as ever... I was also skeptical of poltergeists' (that's what they are?) balance, until I found out they're mostly harmless at melee. I'd say there's a reason the vagary was made a boss by Id, that levitation attack is quite hard to evade.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p228592" date="Posted: Tue Nov 23, 2010 5:21 pm "><author>gb_remake</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I just compiled the D3 gamex86.so on my linux box, just PM me if you wish me to do a test compile of Ruiner.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p228605" date="Posted: Wed Nov 24, 2010 12:15 pm "><author>printz</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Why isn't this thread in the Doom 3 Modifications subforum?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p228606" date="Posted: Wed Nov 24, 2010 1:20 pm "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">printz wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Why isn't this thread in the Doom 3 Modifications subforum?</div><br /><br />Because the author thought it might get more attention in here?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p228616" date="Posted: Thu Nov 25, 2010 5:55 pm "><author>BJA</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">printz wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Why isn't this thread in the Doom 3 Modifications subforum?</div><br />Question is, why this isn`t on the news frontpage...it`s not like a d3 mod gets released every day <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224172232im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />congrats to the beta release btw! <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224172232im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p228621" date="Posted: Fri Nov 26, 2010 12:24 am "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">BJA wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">printz wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Why isn't this thread in the Doom 3 Modifications subforum?</div><br />Question is, why this isn`t on the news frontpage...it`s not like a d3 mod gets released every day <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224172232im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />congrats to the beta release btw! <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224172232im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div><br /><br />True - why isn't it!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p228663" date="Posted: Mon Nov 29, 2010 6:44 pm "><author>mnemjc</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">played trough it just now and overall its quite fun, while not being exactly my setting, so good job so far... however there were a few things i didnt like:<br /><br />1.

Some bosses/enemys seem to be too strong, but this might be because i didn't exactly knew how to pull all these nifty combos off, i just pressed the movement keys randomly while klicking mouse1/mouse2<br /><br />3. a few mapping related issues:<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224172232/http://www.abload.de/image.php?img=shot00004copybl0j.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224172232im_/http://www.abload.de/thumb/shot00004copybl0j.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br />Sorry for the crappy shot.
