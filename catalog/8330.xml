<br /><br />I don't think that is a very fair statement.  People create modifications for different reasons.  Anyone who releases software free to the public has already done the world a big favor with a gift of their time.  Whether or not they choose to make the source code available with it is their decision.  Some people may be novice programmers and don't want to deal with the stress that comes along with pros nit-picking apart their code -- that can be extremely aggrevating.  Even if your original goal was to learn how to program better, some people are just asses about the way they "constructively criticize" other people's work.
<br /><br />Other people may use what they consider to be private algorithms and optimizations that they hope to use some day in a for-profit project.  They have every right to keep these types of things private.
<br /><br />Still other people release software specifically for the feeling of pride they get by providing something useful to the public.  To some this may sound greedy but not to me.  They have already donated their time to create the software in the first place.  Making it open source would potentially rob them of the only benefit they are deriving from their work (personal satisfaction and pride.)  
<br /><br />I think it is unfair to criticize any freeware developer for not releasing their source code.  It is FANTASTIC when you find people willing to share with the public in such a magnanimous way but I think we, as a community, should not expect it and be thankful for the occasions when it occurs. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225030226im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />But hey, thats just my two cents, you are welcome to disagree

<br /><br />As I see it, there are two ways to make a breakable light.  The first is to do the overcomplicated method voldemort describes in the thread you linked to.  You can also just add a health key to your light entity like so:
<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">key: health value: 30</div><br /><br />You can set the sound shader that the light will play when broken by setting snd_broken like so:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">key: snd_broken value: mysndshd</div>
<br /><br />Note that sound shaders have the ability to play an "intro" to a looping sound, and this is how id's broken light sounds work (the "intro" is the actual breaking, then you get the fizzing sounds)
<br /><br /><br /><br />For future reference, this is a <span style="font-weight: bold">coding[/b[ section, and not a [b]level design</span> section.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p132580" date="Posted: Wed Feb 08, 2006 5:28 am "><author>crash23000</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks for the post and help.

My understanding is RunFrame is called in a loop, is there anything else the engine calls in this loop?
<br /><br />I know there are tidbits throughout these forums about this (mostly weapon based, not character)

<br /><br />I don't think that is a very fair statement.  People create modifications for different reasons.  Anyone who releases software free to the public has already done the world a big favor with a gift of their time.  Whether or not they choose to make the source code available with it is their decision.  Some people may be novice programmers and don't want to deal with the stress that comes along with pros nit-picking apart their code -- that can be extremely aggrevating.  Even if your original goal was to learn how to program better, some people are just asses about the way they "constructively criticize" other people's work.
<br /><br />Other people may use what they consider to be private algorithms and optimizations that they hope to use some day in a for-profit project.  They have every right to keep these types of things private.
<br /><br />Still other people release software specifically for the feeling of pride they get by providing something useful to the public.  To some this may sound greedy but not to me.  They have already donated their time to create the software in the first place.  Making it open source would potentially rob them of the only benefit they are deriving from their work (personal satisfaction and pride.)  
<br /><br />I think it is unfair to criticize any freeware developer for not releasing their source code.  It is FANTASTIC when you find people willing to share with the public in such a magnanimous way but I think we, as a community, should not expect it and be thankful for the occasions when it occurs. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225030714im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />But hey, thats just my two cents, you are welcome to disagree

<br /><br />As I see it, there are two ways to make a breakable light.  The first is to do the overcomplicated method voldemort describes in the thread you linked to.  You can also just add a health key to your light entity like so:
<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">key: health value: 30</div><br /><br />You can set the sound shader that the light will play when broken by setting snd_broken like so:<br /><br /><div class="codetitle"><b>Code:</b></div><div class="codecontent">key: snd_broken value: mysndshd</div>
<br /><br />Note that sound shaders have the ability to play an "intro" to a looping sound, and this is how id's broken light sounds work (the "intro" is the actual breaking, then you get the fizzing sounds)
<br /><br /><br /><br />For future reference, this is a <span style="font-weight: bold">coding[/b[ section, and not a [b]level design</span> section.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p132580" date="Posted: Wed Feb 08, 2006 5:28 am "><author>crash23000</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks for the post and help.
