<br /><br />Another word about the camera import usage:
<br />If the "import to selected camera" checkbox is checked, then the animation will be written to the selected camera. If not, a new camera with the name of the md5camera file will be generated.
<br />The "Import at frame #" input is used to move the imported anim to that frame. This makes it easy to append camera animations.

<br /><br />Problem 2 is not really about an "inside out mesh", but just "distorted mesh", and it doesn't relate to the animations, but to the import method of the skeleton. A basic description is in my post on page one, from 2004-08-20. With "Reorient Bones" enabled, the script changes the local coordinate spaces of bones, so that they are aligned and point to their children. Ofcourse the orientations loaded from an animation do not correspond to the original bindpose anymore, so it naturally looks wrong when an animation is loaded onto a model that was imported with "Reorient Bones" enabled. I didn't mention that but now I think I should have. 
<br />So problem 2 is not a bug but a known limitation.
<br />BTW, Obihb had a tip on how you can get better display of the bones in max, it's on page one of this thread, too.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p48744" date="Posted: Fri Sep 10, 2004 12:53 pm "><author>maewlaay</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">the script works well.. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20071110010517im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_surprised.gif" alt=":o" title="Surprised" /><br />but how can i choose the right texture for diffuse map or bump map ??

<br />Great, thanks! With that hint I fixed the problem in the script and you don't have to manually turn off bones.

<br /><br />I recently made a Ouija board. 17 faces, two bones, animated to spell "DIE". At first I had to select the ORIGIN bone and go to CHARACTER\BONE TOOLS and turn off the respective checkboxes to allow the OUIJA POINTER bone to be animated without moving the ORIGIN also. It worked fine. Afterwards, I tried the same set up except I used one bone for the ORIGIN with a DUMMY linked to it. The DUMMY was used to animatd the OUIJA POINTER and free-floated, not affecting the ORIGIN at all, but still had the necessary hierarchy. No messing with the BONE TOOLS was required. The model (17 faces, one ORIGIN bone, one DUMMY) exported with der_ton's MD5 3ds Max exporter and works great.

Can you give me a more detailed description or include screenshots? Maybe something looks wrong to you because the player.md5mesh is in a certain pose that is meant to be like that (the hands are holding an imaginary weapon that is not included in the model).<br /><br />The reorient bones option only makes sense at all if you don't need the model to be compatible with any existing animations. This also counts for importing animations on this reoriented skeleton in 3dsmax. They will give strange results, as the md5anim is interpreted to be relative to an unchanged (not reoriented) set of bones. Sorry for the inconvenience. I should warn about the very limited use of that option in the readme even more.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p188819" date="Posted: Wed Sep 19, 2007 4:46 pm "><author>dw</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Ok, get home and took some screenies.<br /><br />Import player.md5mesh<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071107202701/http://dimwalker.com/temp/wrists.gif">http://dimwalker.com/temp/wrists.gif</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Import af_pose.md5anim<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071107202701/http://dimwalker.com/temp/wrists2.gif">http://dimwalker.com/temp/wrists2.gif</a><!-- m --><br />Here you can clearly see both wrists pointing in a different direction(and I guess they both wrong  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20071107202701im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> ) , oh and also note the thumb on the left hand (l_thumb_03).<br /><br />You see, I need to tweak the skeleton to fit female character mesh(looks really ugly vise versa ), but still have awfully distorted model in game.

In a md5mesh file there are no real bones stored, only a hierarchy of coordinate systems, which is the most basic information that a skeleton has to contain if it is going to be used to animate a mesh. The importer sets up a bone object with that position and orientation that it reads from the md5, and that doesn't always look pretty, but prettyness is irrelevant for it to just work.<br /><br />For convenience and efficiency while animating, if you might rather work with other objects, you can create any object that you want as a bone, position it nicely and then bind it to a bone so that animating the object will result in animating its corresponding bone. You can then hide the bones and work with your helper objects. I remember obihb had another trick, involving empty helper objects or something, I don't quite remember. A search might help you, maybe it's even in this thread, but I gotta get some sleep now.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p30719" date="Posted: Sun Aug 08, 2004 5:02 pm "><author>der_ton</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold">Update</span>: check my latest posts below...<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Outdated info about the first version, left for historical reasons:</span> This is an importer that imports MD5 files into 3ds max4, 5, 6, 7 and gmax.

This looks kinda ugly in max, because the original bone orientations stored in the md5 are maya-style, which means bones extend along their y axis, versus z axis in max.
<br />But now that (when the option is off) the original orientations are preserved, the exported mesh will work with original md5anims.
<br />Even though the bone layout may look stupid, it works, it's not a hack, and the parenting in the skeleton structure does not depend on bones forming a physical chain with their children. Animating it is not really harder. Only selection of bones might be harder, because you can get confused more easily with some bones having unintuitive layout.

<br /><br />Another word about the camera import usage:
<br />If the "import to selected camera" checkbox is checked, then the animation will be written to the selected camera. If not, a new camera with the name of the md5camera file will be generated.
<br />The "Import at frame #" input is used to move the imported anim to that frame. This makes it easy to append camera animations. That's useful because Doom3 sometimes uses several md5camera files for a scene.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p43910" date="Posted: Sun Aug 29, 2004 11:47 pm "><author>ChaosPhoenix</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Ive got some funk going on:
