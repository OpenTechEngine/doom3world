<br/><br/>
Suffice it to say I broke down and just made a simple texture/material combo for my laser, and it apparently works well enough for me.  All this visual stuff kind of ruins my mood because I know what I want but I don't know the language to describe it, nor do I know the vernacular of the graphics world to be able to understand what button or value or command in the material/particle/texture world will actually achieve my desired aim.  Of course, yes, I could learn, but that time would be better spent for me learning PHP, xml, and a dozen other new programming languages, than to waste my frustrated time to attempt and achieve some semblance of "art".  &#13;
<br/><br/>
Anyway.  This is what I've got, and because I obviously don't know what I'm doing this is what it looks like:&#13;

Naturally, that tubular effect expanding and fading the laser beam is not my intention.  But with this imagery and description, I figured (in a naive hopeful sort of way) that someone could give me a quick fix of what I need to do to the material to get the texture of the beam to just render solidly, instead of fading in the distance, or growing in diameter.&#13;
<br/>
(if anything it should slightly reduce in diameter the further away from the light source - the barrel of the gun, and possibly fade in the last, oh say 10% of the beam, but i'm not picky, just getting it to stay solid from start to finish would be just fine.)&#13;
<br/><br/>
Thanks&#13;
