We are in need of sword attacks, axe attacks, and hand to hand combat animations.  <br /><br />Animators can use either 3ds max or maya to create the animations.  They may use bipeds or their own custom skeleton and rig to create them with very, very few requirements in setting them up to be compatable.  Interested animators can start creating work immediently without having to wait for development to hold them back.  Everything else has already been setup and ready to go.  Full documentation and video exmaples of the fighting moves we are currently in need of are available too.<br /><br />We are able to transfer animations from one skeleton to another effectivly and quickly.  This is how animators are able to use their own skeletons, bipeds and rigs.  The only requirements needed is the skeleton or biped needs to be the same size as the skeleton it is replacing.<br /><br />For more information on Ruiner, visit our mod database page:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225101207/http://www.moddb.com/mods/ruiner">http://www.moddb.com/mods/ruiner</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Ruiner is a midievil thirdperson modification for doom3.
