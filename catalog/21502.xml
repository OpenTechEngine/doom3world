By the time Doom 4 comes out I'll need yet another new PC, and I just got one this last december. I wonder how long it will take to make this one?

I still hope they keep the survival horror type feel to it, it worked really well, although some dislike the fact it was too dark and you couldn't use a flashlight and hold a gun at the same time.<br /><br />I'd like to see the return of the arachnotron, spider mastermind, pain elemental, and of course the new baddies from Doom 3. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081119154001im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p198603" date="Posted: Wed May 07, 2008 6:14 pm "><author>LDAsh</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Wow, this seems totally unexpected!

Let's define what terrible is:<br /><br />- Gigli (2003) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225041016/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0299930/" class="postlink">link</a><br />- Envy (2004) with Jack Black <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225041016/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0326856/" class="postlink">link</a><br />- 'Knocking it Old Skool' <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225041016/http://www.moviefone.com/movie/kickin-it-old-skool/28684/main" class="postlink">link</a><br />- Superbabies <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225041016/http://www.moviefone.com/movie/superbabies-baby-geniuses-2/19346/main" class="postlink">link</a><br /><br />And the list goes on...

All I want is for ID to really work on their sound design, and sound programming for that matter. Doom 3 had good sounds but many in my opinion as a sound designer were upsetting and lacked vitality and punch. Some sounds that they used weren't even edited at all but taken directly from sample cd presets.  I expected better in Quake 4 but all I got was edited sounds ported from Doom 3.

Imp as possesed to maximum humans is awesome idea (and it was possesion, not just mutation. Deformations were appearing after unlocking soul and were always acompanied by screwed up electricity - just like in game, when demons were spawned in our dimension)<br /><br />Also you gotta love the wink with BFG for die hard fans <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225040917im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />. In D1 and D2 both plasma gun and bfg were running on cells ammo, so they were different variations of the same technology. Bfg in game had 9000 code number, the one in movie has v. 3.14. Movie bfg is just plasma gun prototype! Thats why it shots blue projectiles and melts the enviroment (since D1, through Q3, plasma gun kills are described in console as melting the opponent). When the prototype was elevated to useful weapon in the future, bfg code name was given to the next level step of the tech.<br /><br />Oh, and i'm pretty sure Reapers face damage before c24 shot was heavily based on D1/D2 doom marine face with health beneath 25 points (open, bleeding scar on the left cheek should be spot on!)</div>]]></body></post><post id="p221284" date="Posted: Wed Dec 23, 2009 2:32 am "><author>CrimsonHead</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I prefer to just ignore the movie and pretend like it never happened, or that it's non-canonical expanded universe material like fan-fiction.

At least in <span style="font-style: italic">spirit</span> it's Doom. Not like other movies about games such as the Far Cry movie and the BloodRayne movies which suck (badly).

As long as its scary and doesn't lose too much of the Doom feel, it should sell well.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p198642" date="Posted: Wed May 07, 2008 11:30 pm "><author>evilartist</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Kristian Joensen wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">TelMarine wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I'm just glad we will see more than one id game every four years.

What more can they possibly do with Doom, even if it's more like 1&amp;2 instead of 3? Can they come up with anything new to make the series more fun? <br /><br />I remember back during Doom 1, games actually "rewarded" players for killing monsters. In Doom 3, monsters would just stiffen into ragdolls and disintegrate. Who thinks it would be a great idea to start a thread about "What we want to see/return in Doom 4?"

Especially since it looks like that's going to be apart of the "next-gen" (or just a minor advancement of this current-gen). Besides, I think they are doing a mixture of death animations and ragdoll in Rage. (E.g. Animation = NPC gets shot, falls toward the ground - then this is when the ragdoll physics takes over and it's all dynamically calculated.) (See <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081115003411/http://www.naturalmotion.com/euphoria.htm" class="postlink">Euphoria</a>.)<br /><br />Doom 4 was obviously going to happen. I'm just surprised development is starting so soon.<br /><br />I'm with the crowd that wants to see Doom on Earth.<br /><br />EDIT: Also, the video demo of Euphoria only shows their AI animation stuff. But they have another video in there somewhere that shows how you can mix keyframe animation with ragdolls.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p198648" date="Posted: Thu May 08, 2008 1:37 am "><author>pbmax</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">CrimsonHead wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Oh god, here it goes again, I spent like 4 years posting daily at PlanetDoom waiting for Doom³, speculating, anylizing every little detail in screenshots, every little tidbit of info, going frame by frame through the trailers.</div><br /><br />those were good times at planetdoom- almost magical looking back at it. i wonder if it will be like that again? i'm gonna try to keep my expectations in check this time around though because i got a little too amped up for doom3.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p198650" date="Posted: Thu May 08, 2008 2:58 am "><author>ViPr</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">i bet it will be cooperative on the consoles only and it will be rated teen so the horror element will have to go. a survival horror game without horror is not so good by the way.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p198651" date="Posted: Thu May 08, 2008 4:24 am "><author>revility</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">pleasently surprised to see it announced this early.  It was inevitable that it would happen, but I didn't think an announcement would this year.  id tech 5 must really make deving that much smoother for them announce plans for a quake arena and d4 on tech 5 before rage is released.<br /><br />There is still so much more room for this franchise to grow beyond putting it on earth.  There is also allot more fps games can do to really make you feel like your really in somebody's head and immerse the player into the world.  D4 really has the chance to do this and trailblaze just like the original did.  But I would also welcome seeing it branch out into another genre like thirdperson or a thirdperson/fps mix.<br /><br />Something with the location based damage reaction, gore, slight rpg upgrades, and heavy action like resident evil 4, the creepyness of silent hill and thats balls out feeling from gears of war set on earth would be really crazy.

But the sound turned out decent, so its all good.  <br /><br />They already have the keypads and gui system -- they need to put that to better use, so that you must go around and have to assemble clues to get codes to open doors and what-not.  and NOT, I repeat, not close the door behind you once you've entered a new section for no reason.

Some sounds that they used weren't even edited at all but taken directly from sample cd presets.  I expected better in Quake 4 but all I got was edited sounds ported from Doom 3.

I still hope they keep the survival horror type feel to it, it worked really well, although some dislike the fact it was too dark and you couldn't use a flashlight and hold a gun at the same time.<br /><br />I'd like to see the return of the arachnotron, spider mastermind, pain elemental, and of course the new baddies from Doom 3. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081115004121im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p198603" date="Posted: Wed May 07, 2008 6:14 pm "><author>LDAsh</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Wow, this seems totally unexpected!

All I want is for ID to really work on their sound design, and sound programming for that matter. Doom 3 had good sounds but many in my opinion as a sound designer were upsetting and lacked vitality and punch. Some sounds that they used weren't even edited at all but taken directly from sample cd presets.  I expected better in Quake 4 but all I got was edited sounds ported from Doom 3. As for Quakewars I thought that the team vocals were absolutely terrible. ie.

In D1 and D2 both plasma gun and bfg were running on cells ammo, so they were different variations of the same technology. Bfg in game had 9000 code number, the one in movie has v. 3.14. Movie bfg is just plasma gun prototype! Thats why it shots blue projectiles and melts the enviroment (since D1, through Q3, plasma gun kills are described in console as melting the opponent). When the prototype was elevated to useful weapon in the future, bfg code name was given to the next level step of the tech.<br /><br />Oh, and i'm pretty sure Reapers face damage before c24 shot was heavily based on D1/D2 doom marine face with health beneath 25 points (open, bleeding scar on the left cheek should be spot on!)</div>]]></body></post><post id="p221284" date="Posted: Wed Dec 23, 2009 2:32 am "><author>CrimsonHead</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I prefer to just ignore the movie and pretend like it never happened, or that it's non-canonical expanded universe material like fan-fiction.

At least in <span style="font-style: italic">spirit</span> it's Doom. Not like other movies about games such as the Far Cry movie and the BloodRayne movies which suck (badly). Compared to most other movies based on games, Doom was actually a success in my book.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p199973" date="Posted: Sun Jun 08, 2008 6:15 am "><author>Kristus</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">nirvaa wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Its the demo to ID tech 5, the engine that Doom 4 is being built on.

All I want is for ID to really work on their sound design, and sound programming for that matter. Doom 3 had good sounds but many in my opinion as a sound designer were upsetting and lacked vitality and punch. Some sounds that they used weren't even edited at all but taken directly from sample cd presets.  I expected better in Quake 4 but all I got was edited sounds ported from Doom 3. As for Quakewars I thought that the team vocals were absolutely terrible. ie. GRENADE!!<br />Well I hope they work hard this time as sound quality can really improve the atmospheric nature of any game by 10000 percent <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081115003828im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p200281" date="Posted: Fri Jun 13, 2008 11:07 pm "><author>Douglas Quaid</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I know this is all very new to us but when do would you think D4 will be released?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p200289" date="Posted: Sat Jun 14, 2008 5:15 am "><author>Phobos</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Douglas Quaid wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I know this is all very new to us but when do would you think D4 will be released?</div><br /><br />Realistically, late 2010/early 2011 depending on what technological assets speed up the development process/how far they've already gotten on the project.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p200523" date="Posted: Wed Jun 18, 2008 11:11 pm "><author>combatbox</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">well  glad to here it  not bothered about the single player ,but hope the multiplayer will be bad ass fragging style  with  awsome maps <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081115003828im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081115003828im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" alt=":|" title="Neutral" /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081115003828im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081115003828im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil" /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081115003828im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_arrow.gif" alt=":arrow:" title="Arrow" /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081115003828im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_idea.gif" alt=":idea:" title="Idea" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p198586" date="Posted: Wed May 07, 2008 5:07 pm "><author>Kristian Joensen</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081115004518/http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/52560" class="postlink">According to Shacknews id Software has just announced Doom 4.</a><br /><br />Edit:<br /><br />id now has got 4 internal development teams: Rage, Quake Live, id Mobile and Doom 4.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p198588" date="Posted: Wed May 07, 2008 5:13 pm "><author>Xezr</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Lovely news.

I still hope they keep the survival horror type feel to it, it worked really well, although some dislike the fact it was too dark and you couldn't use a flashlight and hold a gun at the same time.<br /><br />I'd like to see the return of the arachnotron, spider mastermind, pain elemental, and of course the new baddies from Doom 3. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081115003843im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p198603" date="Posted: Wed May 07, 2008 6:14 pm "><author>LDAsh</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Wow, this seems totally unexpected!
