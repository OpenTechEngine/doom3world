<br />the diffusemap is still gonna need some work. but other then that its look pretty good
<br /><br />just have to find a way to get around those seams though <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205111925im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p125705" date="Posted: Thu Dec 15, 2005 12:32 am "><author>doomkid3000</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">i was wandering how would i go about making some realistic hair for him though,</div>]]></body></post><post id="p125729" date="Posted: Thu Dec 15, 2005 2:27 am "><author>kat</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">It's all in the textures.

<br /><br />its just that there's not that much info on texturing stuff like faces i dont have that insane knolege on how precisely a face texture should look or how your paint a hair for texturing the top of the head
<br /><br />or what kind of brushes you guys use etc, i dont think Gimp has the variatiy of brushes the photoshop has, thats why im asking <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205111925im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p125743" date="Posted: Thu Dec 15, 2005 10:17 am "><author>obihb</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">You may be better off using some photo ref instead of painting. 
<br /><br />It could also work well without really giving the hair any bump and using the spec map to control the look. So you'll have thin lines on the spec and in the game only those will react, giving the illusion of the hair strands having some sort of volume.
<br /><br />Getting the hair to look good with bump is harder if the map is not very high res and you can get those strands of hair really thin. 
<br /><br />I guess you could use a combined effect where the spec controls the more detail of the hair and the bump gives a less precise indication of volume.
<br /><br />Also some bits of small translucency can help give it that extra bit of volume, like on the Quake4 marine models.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p125744" date="Posted: Thu Dec 15, 2005 10:44 am "><author>doomkid3000</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">are there any reference of hair though, btw i also was wandering if theres any skin reference for texturing his face so the skin looks more real on its tones and detail 
<br /><br />i looked at the translucency of the hair on the young guy head and it uses a decal type material. the actual texture is white with black hair fur look, is that what your saying and having small tiny speculars on top of that to give it detail  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205111925im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />guess i'll be looking around for this stuff later</div>]]></body></post><post id="p125762" date="Posted: Thu Dec 15, 2005 3:08 pm "><author>obihb</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">No, I don't think you can have spec on a decal type material. It's translucent and has no reaction with light. But you can use them and have the hair have a bit of volume. You don't cover the head with it, just some places where it makes sence. Have a look at the Quake4 marine model in the Quake4 model viewer, it's very well done on that model. The Quake stuff is some of the best stuff to look at anyway for making a character. The stuff is just very well done.
<br /><br />You use the spec on the texture for the head, which would have the hair drawn in it. The spec helps to show hair strands better, in stead of flat smooth look. The bump can also help here but should be used in a subtle way to make it not look like plastic hair.
<br /><br />For hair ref I'm sure if you search for some pics on the net you should get enough to copy/paste some hair from. Same with face ref or skin texture. Or take a digital cam and take photos of your own, or your dad face and skin and manipulate that for use on the model.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p125794" date="Posted: Thu Dec 15, 2005 9:42 pm "><author>doomkid3000</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">ok then <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205111925im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_surprised.gif" alt=":o" title="Surprised" />  so the hair is part of the head texture then, somwhat like d3 did there's and q4, i'll try that
<br /><br />the reason i wanted to use decals for hair is so the hair is actualy like its modeled and not textured <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205111925im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /><br /><br />but whatever works out best so i'll try your method
<br /><br />EDIT all the sites i have found with skin and hair reference want you to pay <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205111925im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p125799" date="Posted: Thu Dec 15, 2005 11:13 pm "><author>obihb</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">There's no harm in trying it both ways. But the thing is either way you need to draw a base hair on the head. Either by using photos or draw by hand. What you do ontop of that is up to you. Or even do nothing on top of that and just make the base hair texture look as good as possible.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p125815" date="Posted: Fri Dec 16, 2005 1:56 am "><author>doomkid3000</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">i'll let you know how this comes out <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205111925im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p126299" date="Posted: Tue Dec 20, 2005 10:14 am "><author>doomkid3000</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">ok update

<br /><br />its just that there's not that much info on texturing stuff like faces i dont have that insane knolege on how precisely a face texture should look or how your paint a hair for texturing the top of the head
<br /><br />or what kind of brushes you guys use etc, i dont think Gimp has the variatiy of brushes the photoshop has, thats why im asking <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225093449im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p125743" date="Posted: Thu Dec 15, 2005 11:17 am "><author>obihb</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">You may be better off using some photo ref instead of painting. 
<br /><br />It could also work well without really giving the hair any bump and using the spec map to control the look. So you'll have thin lines on the spec and in the game only those will react, giving the illusion of the hair strands having some sort of volume.
<br /><br />Getting the hair to look good with bump is harder if the map is not very high res and you can get those strands of hair really thin. 
<br /><br />I guess you could use a combined effect where the spec controls the more detail of the hair and the bump gives a less precise indication of volume.
<br /><br />Also some bits of small translucency can help give it that extra bit of volume, like on the Quake4 marine models.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p125744" date="Posted: Thu Dec 15, 2005 11:44 am "><author>doomkid3000</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">are there any reference of hair though, btw i also was wandering if theres any skin reference for texturing his face so the skin looks more real on its tones and detail 
<br /><br />i looked at the translucency of the hair on the young guy head and it uses a decal type material. the actual texture is white with black hair fur look, is that what your saying and having small tiny speculars on top of that to give it detail  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225093449im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />guess i'll be looking around for this stuff later</div>]]></body></post><post id="p125762" date="Posted: Thu Dec 15, 2005 4:08 pm "><author>obihb</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">No, I don't think you can have spec on a decal type material. It's translucent and has no reaction with light. But you can use them and have the hair have a bit of volume. You don't cover the head with it, just some places where it makes sence. Have a look at the Quake4 marine model in the Quake4 model viewer, it's very well done on that model. The Quake stuff is some of the best stuff to look at anyway for making a character. The stuff is just very well done.
<br /><br />You use the spec on the texture for the head, which would have the hair drawn in it. The spec helps to show hair strands better, in stead of flat smooth look. The bump can also help here but should be used in a subtle way to make it not look like plastic hair.
<br /><br />For hair ref I'm sure if you search for some pics on the net you should get enough to copy/paste some hair from. Same with face ref or skin texture. Or take a digital cam and take photos of your own, or your dad face and skin and manipulate that for use on the model.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p125794" date="Posted: Thu Dec 15, 2005 10:42 pm "><author>doomkid3000</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">ok then <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225093449im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_surprised.gif" alt=":o" title="Surprised" />  so the hair is part of the head texture then, somwhat like d3 did there's and q4, i'll try that
<br /><br />the reason i wanted to use decals for hair is so the hair is actualy like its modeled and not textured <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225093449im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /><br /><br />but whatever works out best so i'll try your method

<br /><br />its just that there's not that much info on texturing stuff like faces i dont have that insane knolege on how precisely a face texture should look or how your paint a hair for texturing the top of the head
<br /><br />or what kind of brushes you guys use etc, i dont think Gimp has the variatiy of brushes the photoshop has, thats why im asking <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225093449im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p125743" date="Posted: Thu Dec 15, 2005 11:17 am "><author>obihb</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">You may be better off using some photo ref instead of painting. 
<br /><br />It could also work well without really giving the hair any bump and using the spec map to control the look. So you'll have thin lines on the spec and in the game only those will react, giving the illusion of the hair strands having some sort of volume.
<br /><br />Getting the hair to look good with bump is harder if the map is not very high res and you can get those strands of hair really thin. 
<br /><br />I guess you could use a combined effect where the spec controls the more detail of the hair and the bump gives a less precise indication of volume.
<br /><br />Also some bits of small translucency can help give it that extra bit of volume, like on the Quake4 marine models.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p125744" date="Posted: Thu Dec 15, 2005 11:44 am "><author>doomkid3000</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">are there any reference of hair though, btw i also was wandering if theres any skin reference for texturing his face so the skin looks more real on its tones and detail 
<br /><br />i looked at the translucency of the hair on the young guy head and it uses a decal type material. the actual texture is white with black hair fur look, is that what your saying and having small tiny speculars on top of that to give it detail  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225093449im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />guess i'll be looking around for this stuff later</div>]]></body></post><post id="p125762" date="Posted: Thu Dec 15, 2005 4:08 pm "><author>obihb</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">No, I don't think you can have spec on a decal type material. It's translucent and has no reaction with light. But you can use them and have the hair have a bit of volume. You don't cover the head with it, just some places where it makes sence. Have a look at the Quake4 marine model in the Quake4 model viewer, it's very well done on that model. The Quake stuff is some of the best stuff to look at anyway for making a character. The stuff is just very well done.
<br /><br />You use the spec on the texture for the head, which would have the hair drawn in it. The spec helps to show hair strands better, in stead of flat smooth look. The bump can also help here but should be used in a subtle way to make it not look like plastic hair.
<br /><br />For hair ref I'm sure if you search for some pics on the net you should get enough to copy/paste some hair from. Same with face ref or skin texture. Or take a digital cam and take photos of your own, or your dad face and skin and manipulate that for use on the model.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p125794" date="Posted: Thu Dec 15, 2005 10:42 pm "><author>doomkid3000</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">ok then <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225093449im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_surprised.gif" alt=":o" title="Surprised" />  so the hair is part of the head texture then, somwhat like d3 did there's and q4, i'll try that
<br /><br />the reason i wanted to use decals for hair is so the hair is actualy like its modeled and not textured <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225093449im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /><br /><br />but whatever works out best so i'll try your method

<br /><br />its just that there's not that much info on texturing stuff like faces i dont have that insane knolege on how precisely a face texture should look or how your paint a hair for texturing the top of the head
<br /><br />or what kind of brushes you guys use etc, i dont think Gimp has the variatiy of brushes the photoshop has, thats why im asking <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p125743" date="Posted: Thu Dec 15, 2005 10:17 am "><author>obihb</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">You may be better off using some photo ref instead of painting. 
<br /><br />It could also work well without really giving the hair any bump and using the spec map to control the look. So you'll have thin lines on the spec and in the game only those will react, giving the illusion of the hair strands having some sort of volume.
<br /><br />Getting the hair to look good with bump is harder if the map is not very high res and you can get those strands of hair really thin. 
<br /><br />I guess you could use a combined effect where the spec controls the more detail of the hair and the bump gives a less precise indication of volume.
<br /><br />Also some bits of small translucency can help give it that extra bit of volume, like on the Quake4 marine models.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p125744" date="Posted: Thu Dec 15, 2005 10:44 am "><author>doomkid3000</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">are there any reference of hair though, btw i also was wandering if theres any skin reference for texturing his face so the skin looks more real on its tones and detail 
<br /><br />i looked at the translucency of the hair on the young guy head and it uses a decal type material. the actual texture is white with black hair fur look, is that what your saying and having small tiny speculars on top of that to give it detail  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />guess i'll be looking around for this stuff later</div>]]></body></post><post id="p125762" date="Posted: Thu Dec 15, 2005 3:08 pm "><author>obihb</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">No, I don't think you can have spec on a decal type material. It's translucent and has no reaction with light. But you can use them and have the hair have a bit of volume. You don't cover the head with it, just some places where it makes sence. Have a look at the Quake4 marine model in the Quake4 model viewer, it's very well done on that model. The Quake stuff is some of the best stuff to look at anyway for making a character. The stuff is just very well done.
<br /><br />You use the spec on the texture for the head, which would have the hair drawn in it. The spec helps to show hair strands better, in stead of flat smooth look. The bump can also help here but should be used in a subtle way to make it not look like plastic hair.
<br /><br />For hair ref I'm sure if you search for some pics on the net you should get enough to copy/paste some hair from. Same with face ref or skin texture. Or take a digital cam and take photos of your own, or your dad face and skin and manipulate that for use on the model.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p125794" date="Posted: Thu Dec 15, 2005 9:42 pm "><author>doomkid3000</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">ok then <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_surprised.gif" alt=":o" title="Surprised" />  so the hair is part of the head texture then, somwhat like d3 did there's and q4, i'll try that

Have a look at the Quake4 marine model in the Quake4 model viewer, it's very well done on that model. The Quake stuff is some of the best stuff to look at anyway for making a character.

It's translucent and has no reaction with light. But you can use them and have the hair have a bit of volume. You don't cover the head with it, just some places where it makes sence. Have a look at the Quake4 marine model in the Quake4 model viewer, it's very well done on that model. The Quake stuff is some of the best stuff to look at anyway for making a character. The stuff is just very well done.&#13;<br /><br />You use the spec on the texture for the head, which would have the hair drawn in it. The spec helps to show hair strands better, in stead of flat smooth look. The bump can also help here but should be used in a subtle way to make it not look like plastic hair.&#13;<br /><br />For hair ref I'm sure if you search for some pics on the net you should get enough to copy/paste some hair from. Same with face ref or skin texture. Or take a digital cam and take photos of your own, or your dad face and skin and manipulate that for use on the model.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p125794" date="Posted: Thu Dec 15, 2005 9:42 pm "><author>doomkid3000</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">ok then <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_surprised.gif" alt=":o" title="Surprised" />  so the hair is part of the head texture then, somwhat like d3 did there's and q4, i'll try that&#13;<br /><br />the reason i wanted to use decals for hair is so the hair is actualy like its modeled and not textured <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /><br /><br />but whatever works out best so i'll try your method&#13;<br /><br />EDIT all the sites i have found with skin and hair reference want you to pay <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p125799" date="Posted: Thu Dec 15, 2005 11:13 pm "><author>obihb</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">There's no harm in trying it both ways.

It's translucent and has no reaction with light. But you can use them and have the hair have a bit of volume. You don't cover the head with it, just some places where it makes sence. Have a look at the Quake4 marine model in the Quake4 model viewer, it's very well done on that model. The Quake stuff is some of the best stuff to look at anyway for making a character. The stuff is just very well done.&#13;<br /><br />You use the spec on the texture for the head, which would have the hair drawn in it. The spec helps to show hair strands better, in stead of flat smooth look. The bump can also help here but should be used in a subtle way to make it not look like plastic hair.&#13;<br /><br />For hair ref I'm sure if you search for some pics on the net you should get enough to copy/paste some hair from. Same with face ref or skin texture. Or take a digital cam and take photos of your own, or your dad face and skin and manipulate that for use on the model.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p125794" date="Posted: Thu Dec 15, 2005 9:42 pm "><author>doomkid3000</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">ok then <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_surprised.gif" alt=":o" title="Surprised" />  so the hair is part of the head texture then, somwhat like d3 did there's and q4, i'll try that&#13;<br /><br />the reason i wanted to use decals for hair is so the hair is actualy like its modeled and not textured <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /><br /><br />but whatever works out best so i'll try your method&#13;<br /><br />EDIT all the sites i have found with skin and hair reference want you to pay <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p125799" date="Posted: Thu Dec 15, 2005 11:13 pm "><author>obihb</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">There's no harm in trying it both ways.

<br /><br />its just that there's not that much info on texturing stuff like faces i dont have that insane knolege on how precisely a face texture should look or how your paint a hair for texturing the top of the head
<br /><br />or what kind of brushes you guys use etc, i dont think Gimp has the variatiy of brushes the photoshop has, thats why im asking <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p125743" date="Posted: Thu Dec 15, 2005 10:17 am "><author>obihb</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">You may be better off using some photo ref instead of painting. 
<br /><br />It could also work well without really giving the hair any bump and using the spec map to control the look. So you'll have thin lines on the spec and in the game only those will react, giving the illusion of the hair strands having some sort of volume.
<br /><br />Getting the hair to look good with bump is harder if the map is not very high res and you can get those strands of hair really thin. 
<br /><br />I guess you could use a combined effect where the spec controls the more detail of the hair and the bump gives a less precise indication of volume.
<br /><br />Also some bits of small translucency can help give it that extra bit of volume, like on the Quake4 marine models.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p125744" date="Posted: Thu Dec 15, 2005 10:44 am "><author>doomkid3000</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">are there any reference of hair though, btw i also was wandering if theres any skin reference for texturing his face so the skin looks more real on its tones and detail 
<br /><br />i looked at the translucency of the hair on the young guy head and it uses a decal type material. the actual texture is white with black hair fur look, is that what your saying and having small tiny speculars on top of that to give it detail  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />guess i'll be looking around for this stuff later</div>]]></body></post><post id="p125762" date="Posted: Thu Dec 15, 2005 3:08 pm "><author>obihb</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">No, I don't think you can have spec on a decal type material. It's translucent and has no reaction with light. But you can use them and have the hair have a bit of volume. You don't cover the head with it, just some places where it makes sence. Have a look at the Quake4 marine model in the Quake4 model viewer, it's very well done on that model. The Quake stuff is some of the best stuff to look at anyway for making a character. The stuff is just very well done.
<br /><br />You use the spec on the texture for the head, which would have the hair drawn in it. The spec helps to show hair strands better, in stead of flat smooth look. The bump can also help here but should be used in a subtle way to make it not look like plastic hair.
<br /><br />For hair ref I'm sure if you search for some pics on the net you should get enough to copy/paste some hair from. Same with face ref or skin texture. Or take a digital cam and take photos of your own, or your dad face and skin and manipulate that for use on the model.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p125794" date="Posted: Thu Dec 15, 2005 9:42 pm "><author>doomkid3000</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">ok then <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_surprised.gif" alt=":o" title="Surprised" />  so the hair is part of the head texture then, somwhat like d3 did there's and q4, i'll try that

<br /><br />It could also work well without really giving the hair any bump and using the spec map to control the look. So you'll have thin lines on the spec and in the game only those will react, giving the illusion of the hair strands having some sort of volume.
<br /><br />Getting the hair to look good with bump is harder if the map is not very high res and you can get those strands of hair really thin. 
<br /><br />I guess you could use a combined effect where the spec controls the more detail of the hair and the bump gives a less precise indication of volume.
<br /><br />Also some bits of small translucency can help give it that extra bit of volume, like on the Quake4 marine models.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p125744" date="Posted: Thu Dec 15, 2005 10:44 am "><author>doomkid3000</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">are there any reference of hair though, btw i also was wandering if theres any skin reference for texturing his face so the skin looks more real on its tones and detail

It's translucent and has no reaction with light. But you can use them and have the hair have a bit of volume. You don't cover the head with it, just some places where it makes sence. Have a look at the Quake4 marine model in the Quake4 model viewer, it's very well done on that model. The Quake stuff is some of the best stuff to look at anyway for making a character. The stuff is just very well done.
<br /><br />You use the spec on the texture for the head, which would have the hair drawn in it. The spec helps to show hair strands better, in stead of flat smooth look. The bump can also help here but should be used in a subtle way to make it not look like plastic hair.
<br /><br />For hair ref I'm sure if you search for some pics on the net you should get enough to copy/paste some hair from. Same with face ref or skin texture. Or take a digital cam and take photos of your own, or your dad face and skin and manipulate that for use on the model.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p125794" date="Posted: Thu Dec 15, 2005 9:42 pm "><author>doomkid3000</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">ok then <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_surprised.gif" alt=":o" title="Surprised" />  so the hair is part of the head texture then, somwhat like d3 did there's and q4, i'll try that

<br /><br />It could also work well without really giving the hair any bump and using the spec map to control the look. So you'll have thin lines on the spec and in the game only those will react, giving the illusion of the hair strands having some sort of volume.
<br /><br />Getting the hair to look good with bump is harder if the map is not very high res and you can get those strands of hair really thin. 
<br /><br />I guess you could use a combined effect where the spec controls the more detail of the hair and the bump gives a less precise indication of volume.

It's translucent and has no reaction with light. But you can use them and have the hair have a bit of volume. You don't cover the head with it, just some places where it makes sence. Have a look at the Quake4 marine model in the Quake4 model viewer, it's very well done on that model. The Quake stuff is some of the best stuff to look at anyway for making a character. The stuff is just very well done.
<br /><br />You use the spec on the texture for the head, which would have the hair drawn in it. The spec helps to show hair strands better, in stead of flat smooth look. The bump can also help here but should be used in a subtle way to make it not look like plastic hair.
<br /><br />For hair ref I'm sure if you search for some pics on the net you should get enough to copy/paste some hair from. Same with face ref or skin texture. Or take a digital cam and take photos of your own, or your dad face and skin and manipulate that for use on the model.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p125794" date="Posted: Thu Dec 15, 2005 9:42 pm "><author>doomkid3000</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">ok then <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_surprised.gif" alt=":o" title="Surprised" />  so the hair is part of the head texture then, somwhat like d3 did there's and q4, i'll try that

It's translucent and has no reaction with light. But you can use them and have the hair have a bit of volume. You don't cover the head with it, just some places where it makes sence. Have a look at the Quake4 marine model in the Quake4 model viewer, it's very well done on that model. The Quake stuff is some of the best stuff to look at anyway for making a character. The stuff is just very well done.&#13;<br /><br />You use the spec on the texture for the head, which would have the hair drawn in it. The spec helps to show hair strands better, in stead of flat smooth look. The bump can also help here but should be used in a subtle way to make it not look like plastic hair.&#13;<br /><br />For hair ref I'm sure if you search for some pics on the net you should get enough to copy/paste some hair from. Same with face ref or skin texture. Or take a digital cam and take photos of your own, or your dad face and skin and manipulate that for use on the model.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p125794" date="Posted: Thu Dec 15, 2005 9:42 pm "><author>doomkid3000</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">ok then <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_surprised.gif" alt=":o" title="Surprised" />  so the hair is part of the head texture then, somwhat like d3 did there's and q4, i'll try that&#13;<br /><br />the reason i wanted to use decals for hair is so the hair is actualy like its modeled and not textured <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /><br /><br />but whatever works out best so i'll try your method&#13;<br /><br />EDIT all the sites i have found with skin and hair reference want you to pay <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p125799" date="Posted: Thu Dec 15, 2005 11:13 pm "><author>obihb</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">There's no harm in trying it both ways.

<br /><br />It could also work well without really giving the hair any bump and using the spec map to control the look. So you'll have thin lines on the spec and in the game only those will react, giving the illusion of the hair strands having some sort of volume.
<br /><br />Getting the hair to look good with bump is harder if the map is not very high res and you can get those strands of hair really thin. 
<br /><br />I guess you could use a combined effect where the spec controls the more detail of the hair and the bump gives a less precise indication of volume.
<br /><br />Also some bits of small translucency can help give it that extra bit of volume, like on the Quake4 marine models.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p125744" date="Posted: Thu Dec 15, 2005 10:44 am "><author>doomkid3000</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">are there any reference of hair though, btw i also was wandering if theres any skin reference for texturing his face so the skin looks more real on its tones and detail

It's translucent and has no reaction with light. But you can use them and have the hair have a bit of volume. You don't cover the head with it, just some places where it makes sence. Have a look at the Quake4 marine model in the Quake4 model viewer, it's very well done on that model. The Quake stuff is some of the best stuff to look at anyway for making a character. The stuff is just very well done.
<br /><br />You use the spec on the texture for the head, which would have the hair drawn in it. The spec helps to show hair strands better, in stead of flat smooth look. The bump can also help here but should be used in a subtle way to make it not look like plastic hair.
<br /><br />For hair ref I'm sure if you search for some pics on the net you should get enough to copy/paste some hair from. Same with face ref or skin texture. Or take a digital cam and take photos of your own, or your dad face and skin and manipulate that for use on the model.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p125794" date="Posted: Thu Dec 15, 2005 9:42 pm "><author>doomkid3000</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">ok then <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_surprised.gif" alt=":o" title="Surprised" />  so the hair is part of the head texture then, somwhat like d3 did there's and q4, i'll try that

<br /><br />It could also work well without really giving the hair any bump and using the spec map to control the look. So you'll have thin lines on the spec and in the game only those will react, giving the illusion of the hair strands having some sort of volume.
<br /><br />Getting the hair to look good with bump is harder if the map is not very high res and you can get those strands of hair really thin. 
<br /><br />I guess you could use a combined effect where the spec controls the more detail of the hair and the bump gives a less precise indication of volume.

It's translucent and has no reaction with light. But you can use them and have the hair have a bit of volume. You don't cover the head with it, just some places where it makes sence. Have a look at the Quake4 marine model in the Quake4 model viewer, it's very well done on that model. The Quake stuff is some of the best stuff to look at anyway for making a character. The stuff is just very well done.
<br /><br />You use the spec on the texture for the head, which would have the hair drawn in it. The spec helps to show hair strands better, in stead of flat smooth look. The bump can also help here but should be used in a subtle way to make it not look like plastic hair.
<br /><br />For hair ref I'm sure if you search for some pics on the net you should get enough to copy/paste some hair from. Same with face ref or skin texture. Or take a digital cam and take photos of your own, or your dad face and skin and manipulate that for use on the model.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p125794" date="Posted: Thu Dec 15, 2005 9:42 pm "><author>doomkid3000</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">ok then <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_surprised.gif" alt=":o" title="Surprised" />  so the hair is part of the head texture then, somwhat like d3 did there's and q4, i'll try that

<br /><br />its just that there's not that much info on texturing stuff like faces i dont have that insane knolege on how precisely a face texture should look or how your paint a hair for texturing the top of the head
<br /><br />or what kind of brushes you guys use etc, i dont think Gimp has the variatiy of brushes the photoshop has, thats why im asking <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p125743" date="Posted: Thu Dec 15, 2005 10:17 am "><author>obihb</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">You may be better off using some photo ref instead of painting. 
<br /><br />It could also work well without really giving the hair any bump and using the spec map to control the look. So you'll have thin lines on the spec and in the game only those will react, giving the illusion of the hair strands having some sort of volume.
<br /><br />Getting the hair to look good with bump is harder if the map is not very high res and you can get those strands of hair really thin. 
<br /><br />I guess you could use a combined effect where the spec controls the more detail of the hair and the bump gives a less precise indication of volume.
<br /><br />Also some bits of small translucency can help give it that extra bit of volume, like on the Quake4 marine models.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p125744" date="Posted: Thu Dec 15, 2005 10:44 am "><author>doomkid3000</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">are there any reference of hair though, btw i also was wandering if theres any skin reference for texturing his face so the skin looks more real on its tones and detail 
<br /><br />i looked at the translucency of the hair on the young guy head and it uses a decal type material. the actual texture is white with black hair fur look, is that what your saying and having small tiny speculars on top of that to give it detail  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />guess i'll be looking around for this stuff later</div>]]></body></post><post id="p125762" date="Posted: Thu Dec 15, 2005 3:08 pm "><author>obihb</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">No, I don't think you can have spec on a decal type material. It's translucent and has no reaction with light. But you can use them and have the hair have a bit of volume. You don't cover the head with it, just some places where it makes sence. Have a look at the Quake4 marine model in the Quake4 model viewer, it's very well done on that model. The Quake stuff is some of the best stuff to look at anyway for making a character. The stuff is just very well done.
<br /><br />You use the spec on the texture for the head, which would have the hair drawn in it. The spec helps to show hair strands better, in stead of flat smooth look. The bump can also help here but should be used in a subtle way to make it not look like plastic hair.
<br /><br />For hair ref I'm sure if you search for some pics on the net you should get enough to copy/paste some hair from. Same with face ref or skin texture. Or take a digital cam and take photos of your own, or your dad face and skin and manipulate that for use on the model.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p125794" date="Posted: Thu Dec 15, 2005 9:42 pm "><author>doomkid3000</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">ok then <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_surprised.gif" alt=":o" title="Surprised" />  so the hair is part of the head texture then, somwhat like d3 did there's and q4, i'll try that

It's translucent and has no reaction with light. But you can use them and have the hair have a bit of volume. You don't cover the head with it, just some places where it makes sence. Have a look at the Quake4 marine model in the Quake4 model viewer, it's very well done on that model. The Quake stuff is some of the best stuff to look at anyway for making a character. The stuff is just very well done.&#13;<br /><br />You use the spec on the texture for the head, which would have the hair drawn in it. The spec helps to show hair strands better, in stead of flat smooth look. The bump can also help here but should be used in a subtle way to make it not look like plastic hair.&#13;<br /><br />For hair ref I'm sure if you search for some pics on the net you should get enough to copy/paste some hair from.

<br /><br />It could also work well without really giving the hair any bump and using the spec map to control the look. So you'll have thin lines on the spec and in the game only those will react, giving the illusion of the hair strands having some sort of volume.
<br /><br />Getting the hair to look good with bump is harder if the map is not very high res and you can get those strands of hair really thin. 
<br /><br />I guess you could use a combined effect where the spec controls the more detail of the hair and the bump gives a less precise indication of volume.
<br /><br />Also some bits of small translucency can help give it that extra bit of volume, like on the Quake4 marine models.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p125744" date="Posted: Thu Dec 15, 2005 10:44 am "><author>doomkid3000</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">are there any reference of hair though, btw i also was wandering if theres any skin reference for texturing his face so the skin looks more real on its tones and detail

It's translucent and has no reaction with light. But you can use them and have the hair have a bit of volume. You don't cover the head with it, just some places where it makes sence. Have a look at the Quake4 marine model in the Quake4 model viewer, it's very well done on that model. The Quake stuff is some of the best stuff to look at anyway for making a character. The stuff is just very well done.
<br /><br />You use the spec on the texture for the head, which would have the hair drawn in it. The spec helps to show hair strands better, in stead of flat smooth look. The bump can also help here but should be used in a subtle way to make it not look like plastic hair.
<br /><br />For hair ref I'm sure if you search for some pics on the net you should get enough to copy/paste some hair from. Same with face ref or skin texture. Or take a digital cam and take photos of your own, or your dad face and skin and manipulate that for use on the model.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p125794" date="Posted: Thu Dec 15, 2005 9:42 pm "><author>doomkid3000</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">ok then <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_surprised.gif" alt=":o" title="Surprised" />  so the hair is part of the head texture then, somwhat like d3 did there's and q4, i'll try that

<br /><br />its just that there's not that much info on texturing stuff like faces i dont have that insane knolege on how precisely a face texture should look or how your paint a hair for texturing the top of the head
<br /><br />or what kind of brushes you guys use etc, i dont think Gimp has the variatiy of brushes the photoshop has, thats why im asking <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p125743" date="Posted: Thu Dec 15, 2005 10:17 am "><author>obihb</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">You may be better off using some photo ref instead of painting. 
<br /><br />It could also work well without really giving the hair any bump and using the spec map to control the look. So you'll have thin lines on the spec and in the game only those will react, giving the illusion of the hair strands having some sort of volume.
<br /><br />Getting the hair to look good with bump is harder if the map is not very high res and you can get those strands of hair really thin. 
<br /><br />I guess you could use a combined effect where the spec controls the more detail of the hair and the bump gives a less precise indication of volume.
<br /><br />Also some bits of small translucency can help give it that extra bit of volume, like on the Quake4 marine models.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p125744" date="Posted: Thu Dec 15, 2005 10:44 am "><author>doomkid3000</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">are there any reference of hair though, btw i also was wandering if theres any skin reference for texturing his face so the skin looks more real on its tones and detail 
<br /><br />i looked at the translucency of the hair on the young guy head and it uses a decal type material. the actual texture is white with black hair fur look, is that what your saying and having small tiny speculars on top of that to give it detail  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />guess i'll be looking around for this stuff later</div>]]></body></post><post id="p125762" date="Posted: Thu Dec 15, 2005 3:08 pm "><author>obihb</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">No, I don't think you can have spec on a decal type material. It's translucent and has no reaction with light. But you can use them and have the hair have a bit of volume. You don't cover the head with it, just some places where it makes sence. Have a look at the Quake4 marine model in the Quake4 model viewer, it's very well done on that model. The Quake stuff is some of the best stuff to look at anyway for making a character. The stuff is just very well done.
<br /><br />You use the spec on the texture for the head, which would have the hair drawn in it. The spec helps to show hair strands better, in stead of flat smooth look. The bump can also help here but should be used in a subtle way to make it not look like plastic hair.
<br /><br />For hair ref I'm sure if you search for some pics on the net you should get enough to copy/paste some hair from. Same with face ref or skin texture. Or take a digital cam and take photos of your own, or your dad face and skin and manipulate that for use on the model.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p125794" date="Posted: Thu Dec 15, 2005 9:42 pm "><author>doomkid3000</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">ok then <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_surprised.gif" alt=":o" title="Surprised" />  so the hair is part of the head texture then, somwhat like d3 did there's and q4, i'll try that
<br /><br />the reason i wanted to use decals for hair is so the hair is actualy like its modeled and not textured <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /><br /><br />but whatever works out best so i'll try your method

It's translucent and has no reaction with light. But you can use them and have the hair have a bit of volume. You don't cover the head with it, just some places where it makes sence. Have a look at the Quake4 marine model in the Quake4 model viewer, it's very well done on that model. The Quake stuff is some of the best stuff to look at anyway for making a character. The stuff is just very well done.&#13;<br /><br />You use the spec on the texture for the head, which would have the hair drawn in it. The spec helps to show hair strands better, in stead of flat smooth look. The bump can also help here but should be used in a subtle way to make it not look like plastic hair.&#13;<br /><br />For hair ref I'm sure if you search for some pics on the net you should get enough to copy/paste some hair from.

<br /><br />The first demonstrates forensic reconstruction from skeletal evidence. The second shows a partially dissected face. The third is a simplified diagram of a few parts of the skull. The fourth demonstrates some software for creating new faces from data, including extrapolating how a female sibling of a male would look, how an average person from a certain geographical area or occupation would look, and so on.

<br /><br />i dont mind doing this with md5 and md5anims thats just animation for ingame use
<br /><br />vut for doing modeling its a pain getting it out the door
<br /><br />i hope Silo can replace it for modeling and softimage and some of the other 3d apps out there
<br /><br />its a pain getting a highpoly mesh out and getting it were its smooth and clean on renderbump afterwards
<br /><br />milkshape is good for getting the models nice and clean on the .lwo format
<br /><br />but it sucks because of poly limitations so no go for a good convertion without loosing all the detail in the mesh <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_cry.gif" alt=":cry:" title="Crying or Very sad" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p132154" date="Posted: Fri Feb 03, 2006 9:01 am "><author>doomkid3000</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">here it is i can say its 90% finished

<br /><br />The first demonstrates forensic reconstruction from skeletal evidence. The second shows a partially dissected face. The third is a simplified diagram of a few parts of the skull. The fourth demonstrates some software for creating new faces from data, including extrapolating how a female sibling of a male would look, how an average person from a certain geographical area or occupation would look, and so on.

<br /><br />i dont mind doing this with md5 and md5anims thats just animation for ingame use
<br /><br />vut for doing modeling its a pain getting it out the door
<br /><br />i hope Silo can replace it for modeling and softimage and some of the other 3d apps out there
<br /><br />its a pain getting a highpoly mesh out and getting it were its smooth and clean on renderbump afterwards
<br /><br />milkshape is good for getting the models nice and clean on the .lwo format
<br /><br />but it sucks because of poly limitations so no go for a good convertion without loosing all the detail in the mesh <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_cry.gif" alt=":cry:" title="Crying or Very sad" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p132154" date="Posted: Fri Feb 03, 2006 9:01 am "><author>doomkid3000</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">here it is i can say its 90% finished

The fourth demonstrates some software for creating new faces from data, including extrapolating how a female sibling of a male would look, how an average person from a certain geographical area or occupation would look, and so on.

<br /><br />i dont mind doing this with md5 and md5anims thats just animation for ingame use
<br /><br />vut for doing modeling its a pain getting it out the door
<br /><br />i hope Silo can replace it for modeling and softimage and some of the other 3d apps out there
<br /><br />its a pain getting a highpoly mesh out and getting it were its smooth and clean on renderbump afterwards
<br /><br />milkshape is good for getting the models nice and clean on the .lwo format
<br /><br />but it sucks because of poly limitations so no go for a good convertion without loosing all the detail in the mesh <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_cry.gif" alt=":cry:" title="Crying or Very sad" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p132154" date="Posted: Fri Feb 03, 2006 9:01 am "><author>doomkid3000</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">here it is i can say its 90% finished

<br /><br />The first demonstrates forensic reconstruction from skeletal evidence. The second shows a partially dissected face. The third is a simplified diagram of a few parts of the skull. The fourth demonstrates some software for creating new faces from data, including extrapolating how a female sibling of a male would look, how an average person from a certain geographical area or occupation would look, and so on.

<br /><br />i dont mind doing this with md5 and md5anims thats just animation for ingame use
<br /><br />vut for doing modeling its a pain getting it out the door
<br /><br />i hope Silo can replace it for modeling and softimage and some of the other 3d apps out there
<br /><br />its a pain getting a highpoly mesh out and getting it were its smooth and clean on renderbump afterwards
<br /><br />milkshape is good for getting the models nice and clean on the .lwo format
<br /><br />but it sucks because of poly limitations so no go for a good convertion without loosing all the detail in the mesh <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_cry.gif" alt=":cry:" title="Crying or Very sad" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p132154" date="Posted: Fri Feb 03, 2006 9:01 am "><author>doomkid3000</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">here it is i can say its 90% finished

<br /><br />The first demonstrates forensic reconstruction from skeletal evidence. The second shows a partially dissected face. The third is a simplified diagram of a few parts of the skull. The fourth demonstrates some software for creating new faces from data, including extrapolating how a female sibling of a male would look, how an average person from a certain geographical area or occupation would look, and so on.

<br /><br />i dont mind doing this with md5 and md5anims thats just animation for ingame use
<br /><br />vut for doing modeling its a pain getting it out the door
<br /><br />i hope Silo can replace it for modeling and softimage and some of the other 3d apps out there
<br /><br />its a pain getting a highpoly mesh out and getting it were its smooth and clean on renderbump afterwards
<br /><br />milkshape is good for getting the models nice and clean on the .lwo format
<br /><br />but it sucks because of poly limitations so no go for a good convertion without loosing all the detail in the mesh <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_cry.gif" alt=":cry:" title="Crying or Very sad" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p132154" date="Posted: Fri Feb 03, 2006 9:01 am "><author>doomkid3000</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">here it is i can say its 90% finished

<br /><br />The first demonstrates forensic reconstruction from skeletal evidence. The second shows a partially dissected face. The third is a simplified diagram of a few parts of the skull. The fourth demonstrates some software for creating new faces from data, including extrapolating how a female sibling of a male would look, how an average person from a certain geographical area or occupation would look, and so on.

<br /><br />i dont mind doing this with md5 and md5anims thats just animation for ingame use
<br /><br />vut for doing modeling its a pain getting it out the door
<br /><br />i hope Silo can replace it for modeling and softimage and some of the other 3d apps out there
<br /><br />its a pain getting a highpoly mesh out and getting it were its smooth and clean on renderbump afterwards
<br /><br />milkshape is good for getting the models nice and clean on the .lwo format
<br /><br />but it sucks because of poly limitations so no go for a good convertion without loosing all the detail in the mesh <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_cry.gif" alt=":cry:" title="Crying or Very sad" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p132154" date="Posted: Fri Feb 03, 2006 9:01 am "><author>doomkid3000</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">here it is i can say its 90% finished

One area that should be easy to fix with good impact is the area of the bregma to glabella and nasal bones, or central forehead and nose for starters. The orbital-nasal-oral muscle structure is also off, to mention another. This is a good type of exercise, but I assume you're not intending a real distorted look or you would make other changes to match. I do mean this in a good way to help.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_idea.gif" alt=":idea:" title="Idea" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p130774" date="Posted: Mon Jan 23, 2006 2:55 am "><author>doomkid3000</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">i understand with full openness,

<br /><br />The first demonstrates forensic reconstruction from skeletal evidence. The second shows a partially dissected face. The third is a simplified diagram of a few parts of the skull. The fourth demonstrates some software for creating new faces from data, including extrapolating how a female sibling of a male would look, how an average person from a certain geographical area or occupation would look, and so on.

<br /><br />i dont mind doing this with md5 and md5anims thats just animation for ingame use
<br /><br />vut for doing modeling its a pain getting it out the door
<br /><br />i hope Silo can replace it for modeling and softimage and some of the other 3d apps out there
<br /><br />its a pain getting a highpoly mesh out and getting it were its smooth and clean on renderbump afterwards
<br /><br />milkshape is good for getting the models nice and clean on the .lwo format
<br /><br />but it sucks because of poly limitations so no go for a good convertion without loosing all the detail in the mesh <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_cry.gif" alt=":cry:" title="Crying or Very sad" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p132154" date="Posted: Fri Feb 03, 2006 9:01 am "><author>doomkid3000</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">here it is i can say its 90% finished
