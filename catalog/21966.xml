It's one of the most visually impressive games I've seen to date.  It's the real time shadows, bump/parallax mapping, etc. of Doom 3 + the first stalker.  The screenshots on the official website don't do it justice.  Not because they're not nice shots but because they don't show how well the lighting system works.  <br /><br />Night/day system works well too.  There's no way to skip time so I got stuck going up against military @ night.  Wasn't a great idea.  It also gets nearly black when it's late at night.  Nice to see that &amp; not the almost-dark that most games use for night.  You NEED to use your flashlight, you're blind without it.<br /><br />I'll get some screens that show off the lighting when I get home from work.  Took me a while to figure out where the game stores it's settings, turns out it's almost the same place as the original  game.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081113043631im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />I've also had no crash's or bug, unlike the first game, on release.  Others report it but so far it seems stable for me.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p204785" date="Posted: Thu Sep 11, 2008 10:45 pm "><author>zeh</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Good to know, thanks!<br /><br />S:SoC was easily the game of the year for me when released. Funny how something so unstable could be so good. So I've been waiting for CS since forever. Goddamn snafu with the release dates/cdkeys/whatever. Can't wait to play this, but now I have to wait for the "official" release date (Sept 15) on Steam :/</div>]]></body></post><post id="p204795" date="Posted: Fri Sep 12, 2008 3:42 am "><author>The Happy Friar</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">some images showing off shadows, lights, DOF (when reloading you focus on your weapon &amp; things around you go out of focus), etc.<br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081113043631/http://img525.imageshack.us/my.php?image=ssstephenhowe0911082239om6.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081113043631im_/http://img525.imageshack.us/img525/5830/ssstephenhowe0911082239om6.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081113043631/http://img519.imageshack.us/my.php?image=ssstephenhowe0911082232dz1.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081113043631im_/http://img519.imageshack.us/img519/2848/ssstephenhowe0911082232dz1.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081113043631/http://img522.imageshack.us/my.php?image=ssstephenhowe0911082231fu3.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081113043631im_/http://img522.imageshack.us/img522/5430/ssstephenhowe0911082231fu3.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081113043631/http://img529.imageshack.us/my.php?image=ssstephenhowe0911082230wl2.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081113043631im_/http://img529.imageshack.us/img529/663/ssstephenhowe0911082230wl2.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081113043631/http://img520.imageshack.us/my.php?image=ssstephenhowe0911082228tm1.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081113043631im_/http://img520.imageshack.us/img520/1053/ssstephenhowe0911082228tm1.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081113043631/http://img502.imageshack.us/my.php?image=ssstephenhowe0911082228ud3.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081113043631im_/http://img502.imageshack.us/img502/6020/ssstephenhowe0911082228ud3.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081113043631/http://img529.imageshack.us/my.php?image=ssstephenhowe0911082214pp6.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081113043631im_/http://img529.imageshack.us/img529/6915/ssstephenhowe0911082214pp6.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081113043631/http://img521.imageshack.us/my.php?image=ssstephenhowe0911082206it9.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081113043631im_/http://img521.imageshack.us/img521/1958/ssstephenhowe0911082206it9.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081113043631/http://img525.imageshack.us/my.php?image=ssstephenhowe0911082201ub6.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081113043631im_/http://img525.imageshack.us/img525/6889/ssstephenhowe0911082201ub6.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081113043631/http://img529.imageshack.us/my.php?image=ssstephenhowe0911082201st9.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081113043631im_/http://img529.imageshack.us/img529/7340/ssstephenhowe0911082201st9.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081113043631/http://img526.imageshack.us/my.php?image=ssstephenhowe0911082200vp8.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081113043631im_/http://img526.imageshack.us/img526/1805/ssstephenhowe0911082200vp8.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081113043631/http://img502.imageshack.us/my.php?image=ssstephenhowe0911082200af4.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081113043631im_/http://img502.imageshack.us/img502/5900/ssstephenhowe0911082200af4.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081113043631/http://img98.imageshack.us/my.php?image=ssstephenhowe0911082158xh0.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081113043631im_/http://img98.imageshack.us/img98/6146/ssstephenhowe0911082158xh0.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br /><br />i'm using the best DX9 settings I can.  the wet water &amp; a few other things only work with dx10.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p204796" date="Posted: Fri Sep 12, 2008 4:05 am "><author>Zenix</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Is the actual game any good?

It's not you with a pistol vs 8 guys with shotty's.  It's you with a pistol + shotty vs 8 guys with shottys.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081113043631im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />i am very happy with both games.  So happy in the first game I dealt with ALL the bugs just so I could complete it w/o a patch (like most games, patches break saves).  Oblivion Lost mod for the first one is very good too.<br /><br />To add on to what xhan said, I turned my res down from 1440x900 to 1280x720 (lower res HD) to help performance.  But I find the game so fun I don't care.  It runs pretty much identical to the previous game, so if you run that good you run this one good (just don't install on an external USB2 drive.  Slows loading times a bit.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081113043631im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> )</div>]]></body></post><post id="p204811" date="Posted: Fri Sep 12, 2008 10:50 am "><author>DoomUK</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">My initial thoughts of the game aren't brilliant.<br /><br />I should point out that I'm a <span style="font-style: italic">huge</span> fan of Shadow of Chernobyl.  It had it's flaws, as does any game, but it was/is one of my favorite FPSs of all time; great design, great story, great sense of atmosphere, great gameplay.<br /><br />But Clear Sky just isn't doing it for me so far.  I may be alone, but it has an 'unfinished' feel about it that's hard to put my finger on.  Performance is horrendous, while visually it's not obviously a huge step up from SoC (in DX9 mode, I've yet to be convinced to boot into my Vista install and check out the DX10 tidbits) - fancy new lighting effects or no fancy new lighting effects.  The missions feel like boring, repetitive imitations of the missions in SoC.  You can't fast travel, even though the levels seem much larger and spacious this time around.  No new weapons (so far).  <br /><br />All that said.  I'm hoping that I learn to ignore it's faults and learn to love it as I play on.  It's happened before with a few games (Bioshock, for example).</div>]]></body></post><post id="p204815" date="Posted: Fri Sep 12, 2008 12:04 pm "><author>The Happy Friar</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">DoomUK wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"> You can't fast travel, even though the levels seem much larger and spacious this time around.</div><br /><br />you haven't found the guides yet?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p204817" date="Posted: Fri Sep 12, 2008 1:02 pm "><author>DoomUK</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">The Happy Friar wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">you haven't found the guides yet?</div><br /><br />Not the same thing.<br /><br />The guides are just there as logical intermissions between different levels/missions.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p204824" date="Posted: Fri Sep 12, 2008 1:59 pm "><author>The Happy Friar</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">not sure about you, but the guides will take me to any "base" that's part of a friendly faction.

I <span style="font-style: italic">love</span> atmosphere, and I did really enjoy the storyline behind Stalker. To be honest, I was actually caught off guard by the twist (due to me not going for that "mission" near the end the first time) and wasn't expecting any of that. For once, a game that wasn't predictable (there are others, but it seems every story plot writes itself down in your head as you play it, and you know exactly what happens next). At any rate, I'll be getting Stalker: Clear Sky regardless of reviews and whatnot. <br /><br />I enjoyed the first, and judging by the screenshots/information I read, I'll enjoy this one even more.
