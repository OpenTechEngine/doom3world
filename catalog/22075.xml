If not, how big is your *.clustb file? Also, if you have your map loaded while you run the distributeStuff command you'll need to reloadModels before they show up. Make sure you're using stuff models, not ordinary models (copy them from the stock maps' *.sg files). Finally, make sure you're not generating tons of stuff models otherwise the engine will not draw them (though, when this happens you'll see patches of stuff models randomly blinking out of existence instead of never drawing).</div>]]></body></post><post id="p206203" date="Posted: Fri Oct 17, 2008 6:33 pm "><author>Oneofthe8devilz</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">this is what my stuff.sg file looks like  <br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">version 1<br /> {<br /> 	model "models/chris_ase/greatplanefinal.ASE"<br /> }<br />sdStuffLayer {<br />	Density  10<br />	Distancescale 1<br />	Distribution Area<br />	StuffType "valley/valley_grass_01"<br />	Mask "stuff/stuff.tga"<br />	ColorMap "stuff/stuff_colour.tga"<br />}<br /> sdStuffLayer {<br /> 	Density 3<br /> 	Distancescale 2<br /> 	Distribution Area<br /> 	StuffType "valley/valley_grass_02"<br /> 	Mask "stuff/stuff.tga"<br /> 	ColorMap "stuff/stuff_colour.tga"<br />}<br /></div><br /><br />this is the stuff.tga file I am using (resized):<br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081204105826im_/http://www.556mmfmj.com/public/images/stuff_preview.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />and this is the stuff_colour.tga I am using (resized):<br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081204105826im_/http://www.556mmfmj.com/public/images/stuff_colour_preview.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />and I want to have this terrain covered with valley grass:<br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081204105826im_/http://www.556mmfmj.com/public/images/etqw_delta_shot.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Depeding on what density values I use there are 10k to 70k objects placed and the stuff.clustb file size ranges from 350kb to 1.5mb .. but as already said nothing shows up in game (and r_skipstuff is set to "0")...</div>]]></body></post></posts></thread></xml>
