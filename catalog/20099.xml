I like the piece, but hearing it over and over was a little annoying.<br /><br />To be honest, if a DOOM 3 map takes you a couple of hours, don't release it at all (unless it's for some ultra-super-mega speed mapping contest, or something). Even a week on a map isn't enough.<br /><br />Nice attempt, but not really something people will want to keep on their drive. Once you've got the basics of the editor down, it's easy to throw together any old level, but making something people actually want to <span style="font-style: italic">play</span> is hard. And no screens in your post don't help. You've got them in the .zip file, yes, but I don't want to download a file to see a map's screens.<br /><br />Don't let my post discourage you.

It didn't feel the same. Not to mention that the six or so Mancubi walking around made it seem like I was in an earthquake and made me feel a tiny bit sick.<br /><br />There's also the problem of being able to exit straight away. It's been a while since I played DOOM 2, but I'm sure you couldn't hit the exit switch nearly straight away.<br /><br />The DOOM 3 theme got tiring, too. I like the piece, but hearing it over and over was a little annoying.<br /><br />To be honest, if a DOOM 3 map takes you a couple of hours, don't release it at all (unless it's for some ultra-super-mega speed mapping contest, or something). Even a week on a map isn't enough.<br /><br />Nice attempt, but not really something people will want to keep on their drive. Once you've got the basics of the editor down, it's easy to throw together any old level, but making something people actually want to <span style="font-style: italic">play</span> is hard. And no screens in your post don't help. You've got them in the .zip file, yes, but I don't want to download a file to see a map's screens.<br /><br />Don't let my post discourage you. This was just a bad choice for a map, that's all. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081120190917im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p183899" date="Posted: Tue Jul 17, 2007 9:43 am "><author>efx</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Effort will be rewarded.

I've talked with lots of player during the Q1/2 erra (and who played durring then) who loved dead simple remakes.  They don't need to be simple either.  Several maps had new hidden areas, underground ducts where you could pop out in different places, some where small &amp; fast, some were larger...<br /><br />I'd imagine ANY game dev today would say a "dead simple" style map is the kiss of death just like you said, due to it's simplicity.  But dev's have also said that unless you have great graphics nobody will even look at the game, yet there Wii is with a graphics engine from 2000-2003 &amp; people buy that like crack &amp; the top selling games have graphics that look no better then a cheap made indy PC game.<br /><br />I wouldn't even say people want a more complex map, that want a map they can beat someone else in &amp; not be frustrated.  Notice how many people play Quake games now a days... I'd say that perhaps it's time to go back to a more simple design, complex isn't drawing anyone in except highly competative players &amp; those aren't the ones who fun the dev companies &amp; thus don't get new games made.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p183932" date="Posted: Tue Jul 17, 2007 6:30 pm "><author>_Kev_Boy_</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Skul wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Don't let my post discourage you.
