We (myself and 2 friends) went into a conference room and talked to 3 programmers and their recruiter (their recruiter was our 'tour guide') about what they looked for in new hires, how they got started, and what they normally worked on.  After we walked around the studio and saw things like the development rooms, the gym, the 'commons' area, and the mo-cap studio.  They talked about some really awesome tech they have to import models into a game but we didn't get to see it because they were remodelling part of the studio I think.  Finished it off with a business card and a couple t-shirts which I've worn about once a week since I went.<br /><br />While we were walking through though I glanced at a wall with some artwork on it and thought, 'Hm, it's odd they have Return to Castle Wolfenstein art up...'  At that time I think the Wolfenstein sequel was rumored that it was in dev and at Raven but nothing was announced, now that Wolfenstein was announced at E3 2008 I would assume thats what it was.  They mentioned how the Marvel brand was aquired for development by Activision and Raven was one of the primary studios behind Marvel development , and after the varied success of Ultimate Alliance and X-men Legends I kind of thought they were working on some more Marvel stuff.<br /><br />They have different development rooms for the different teams and one we went through was heavily decked out in Marvel wall covers and stuff.  Obviously there was loads of Quake 4 stuff around as well.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p202221" date="Posted: Thu Jul 17, 2008 3:44 pm "><author>pbmax</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">aaa111 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">yeah that's possible.I remember Activision licenced UE3 a years before.I think they licenced it for it and let raven working on it.</div><br /><br />lunaran (used to work at raven, now at big rooster) commented on shacknews that it is idTech5.<br /><br />so who knows...  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081116080750im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p202222" date="Posted: Thu Jul 17, 2008 3:51 pm "><author>Kristian Joensen</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Link ?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p202229" date="Posted: Thu Jul 17, 2008 5:41 pm "><author>pbmax</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081116080750/http://www.shacknews.com/laryn.x?story=53714">http://www.shacknews.com/laryn.x?story=53714</a><!-- m --><br /><br />its under this thread<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">By: razlebol<br />Which engine are they using?</div><br /><br />there's banter back and forth by some former raven guys. lunaran claims its idtech5, but maybe he's joking around...</div>]]></body></post><post id="p202230" date="Posted: Thu Jul 17, 2008 6:03 pm "><author>TelMarine</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">pbmax wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">http://www.shacknews.com/laryn.x?story=53714<br /><br />its under this thread<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">By: razlebol<br />Which engine are they using?</div><br /><br />there's banter back and forth by some former raven guys. lunaran claims its idtech5, but maybe he's joking around...</div><br />sounds like a joke.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p202239" date="Posted: Thu Jul 17, 2008 8:34 pm "><author>kat</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">It's Unreal Engine 3, not idtech.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p202342" date="Posted: Sat Jul 19, 2008 5:00 pm "><author>qwertz123</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">i think the same and by the look of it; a engine is a engine, u need just some talents to make "something" out of it.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p202076" date="Posted: Tue Jul 15, 2008 8:41 pm "><author>pbmax</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">

We (myself and 2 friends) went into a conference room and talked to 3 programmers and their recruiter (their recruiter was our 'tour guide') about what they looked for in new hires, how they got started, and what they normally worked on.  After we walked around the studio and saw things like the development rooms, the gym, the 'commons' area, and the mo-cap studio.  They talked about some really awesome tech they have to import models into a game but we didn't get to see it because they were remodelling part of the studio I think.  Finished it off with a business card and a couple t-shirts which I've worn about once a week since I went.<br /><br />While we were walking through though I glanced at a wall with some artwork on it and thought, 'Hm, it's odd they have Return to Castle Wolfenstein art up...'  At that time I think the Wolfenstein sequel was rumored that it was in dev and at Raven but nothing was announced, now that Wolfenstein was announced at E3 2008 I would assume thats what it was.  They mentioned how the Marvel brand was aquired for development by Activision and Raven was one of the primary studios behind Marvel development , and after the varied success of Ultimate Alliance and X-men Legends I kind of thought they were working on some more Marvel stuff.<br /><br />They have different development rooms for the different teams and one we went through was heavily decked out in Marvel wall covers and stuff.  Obviously there was loads of Quake 4 stuff around as well.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p202221" date="Posted: Thu Jul 17, 2008 3:44 pm "><author>pbmax</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">aaa111 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">yeah that's possible.I remember Activision licenced UE3 a years before.I think they licenced it for it and let raven working on it.</div><br /><br />lunaran (used to work at raven, now at big rooster) commented on shacknews that it is idTech5.<br /><br />so who knows...  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081116080527im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p202222" date="Posted: Thu Jul 17, 2008 3:51 pm "><author>Kristian Joensen</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Link ?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p202229" date="Posted: Thu Jul 17, 2008 5:41 pm "><author>pbmax</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081116080527/http://www.shacknews.com/laryn.x?story=53714">http://www.shacknews.com/laryn.x?story=53714</a><!-- m --><br /><br />its under this thread<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">By: razlebol<br />Which engine are they using?</div><br /><br />there's banter back and forth by some former raven guys. lunaran claims its idtech5, but maybe he's joking around...</div>]]></body></post><post id="p202230" date="Posted: Thu Jul 17, 2008 6:03 pm "><author>TelMarine</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">pbmax wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">http://www.shacknews.com/laryn.x?story=53714<br /><br />its under this thread<br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">By: razlebol<br />Which engine are they using?</div><br /><br />there's banter back and forth by some former raven guys. lunaran claims its idtech5, but maybe he's joking around...</div><br />sounds like a joke.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p202239" date="Posted: Thu Jul 17, 2008 8:34 pm "><author>kat</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">It's Unreal Engine 3, not idtech.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p202342" date="Posted: Sat Jul 19, 2008 5:00 pm "><author>qwertz123</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">i think the same and by the look of it; a engine is a engine, u need just some talents to make "something" out of it.</div>]]></body></post></posts></thread></xml>
