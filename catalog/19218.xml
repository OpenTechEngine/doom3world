<br /><br />Ok, I am trying to create a new projectile. Instead of starting from scratch, I have created a new mod directory, and I am using the grenade projectile as a base (w_grenade.lwo).
<br /><br />Originally I thought that by simply pressing F5 and changing the name of the surface of my new model to the one used by the grenade (models/weapons/grenadelauncher/w_grenade), I would have more than enough.
<br /><br />Of course, the model is showing in Quake IV, but of course, there is no way that the texture is showing properly. If I am not mistaken, this has to do with the UV texture created for w_grenade.lwo, which is not present when I create a new projectile from scratch.
<br /><br />My question is, do you know a tutorial that would simply explain how to import/create an UV texture to work with my model? I've seen lots of tutorials about UV creation but all of them seem to be overkill...
<br /><br />I just want to grab the UV texture used in w_grenade.lwo and somehow "paste it" in the new projectile I have created, if that is somehow possible'

<br/><br/>
Ok, I am trying to create a new projectile. Instead of starting from scratch, I have created a new mod directory, and I am using the grenade projectile as a base (w_grenade.lwo).&#13;
<br/><br/>
Originally I thought that by simply pressing F5 and changing the name of the surface of my new model to the one used by the grenade (models/weapons/grenadelauncher/w_grenade), I would have more than enough.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Of course, the model is showing in Quake IV, but of course, there is no way that the texture is showing properly. If I am not mistaken, this has to do with the UV texture created for w_grenade.lwo, which is not present when I create a new projectile from scratch.&#13;
<br/><br/>
My question is, do you know a tutorial that would simply explain how to import/create an UV texture to work with my model? I've seen lots of tutorials about UV creation but all of them seem to be overkill...&#13;
<br/><br/>
I just want to grab the UV texture used in w_grenade.lwo and somehow "paste it" in the new projectile I have created, if that is somehow possible'&#13;

<br/><br/>
Ok, I am trying to create a new projectile. Instead of starting from scratch, I have created a new mod directory, and I am using the grenade projectile as a base (w_grenade.lwo).&#13;
<br/><br/>
Originally I thought that by simply pressing F5 and changing the name of the surface of my new model to the one used by the grenade (models/weapons/grenadelauncher/w_grenade), I would have more than enough.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Of course, the model is showing in Quake IV, but of course, there is no way that the texture is showing properly. If I am not mistaken, this has to do with the UV texture created for w_grenade.lwo, which is not present when I create a new projectile from scratch.&#13;
<br/><br/>
My question is, do you know a tutorial that would simply explain how to import/create an UV texture to work with my model? I've seen lots of tutorials about UV creation but all of them seem to be overkill...&#13;
<br/><br/>
I just want to grab the UV texture used in w_grenade.lwo and somehow "paste it" in the new projectile I have created, if that is somehow possible'&#13;
<br/><br/>
Thx in advance! <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0"/><br/>
