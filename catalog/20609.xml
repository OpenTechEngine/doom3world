It only happened one time the whole campaign I played with you, and I didn't get it again that night!<br /><br />You should have stayed on a little later.

Of course I just made sure that my marked location is one that will be populated by the time the rounds get there, it's pretty amazing the amount of damage you can do. On each Air-Strike and Artillery barrage I filled the entire obituary list with kills (NO team kills either! HAH!).<br /><br />You over-exaggerate Phobos!!

It only happened one time the whole campaign I played with you, and I didn't get it again that night!<br /><br />You should have stayed on a little later. In the next campaign I played a little Field Ops, and I tore it up! I got 48 kills in one round, yet again earning most kills.<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081204104841/http://screenshot.xfire.com/screenshot/natural/25240d48fc1f4a7c9d49ff41a8c47ad886143048.png" class="postlink">Screenshot</a> (It's slow because it's .png I think, I don't know if XFire can take jpeg screenshots.)<br /><br />I just used a combination of Air-strikes and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081204104841/http://4newbies.planetwolfenstein.gamespy.com/ETQW/images/artillery_gun.jpg" class="postlink">Artillery Gun</a>. Of course I just made sure that my marked location is one that will be populated by the time the rounds get there, it's pretty amazing the amount of damage you can do. On each Air-Strike and Artillery barrage I filled the entire obituary list with kills (NO team kills either! HAH!).<br /><br />You over-exaggerate Phobos!! You're just jealous of my super ownage skills of being constantly awarded with Most Kills!!!! <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081204104841im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />EDIT: Oh and excuse my curse-word in the screenshot...

That's my so-far personal record of most kills. I bet I can top that, and I'm sure others have, but I did the best I could with a team that kind of got ran over really quick (most of them were new I think).</div>]]></body></post><post id="p189716" date="Posted: Sat Oct 06, 2007 5:09 am "><author>ensiform</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I only got invite from a person, not clan invite. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081204104841im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /><br /><br />BTW why use xfire to take ss anyway.

It only happened one time the whole campaign I played with you, and I didn't get it again that night!<br /><br />You should have stayed on a little later. In the next campaign I played a little Field Ops, and I tore it up! I got 48 kills in one round, yet again earning most kills.<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081204104841/http://screenshot.xfire.com/screenshot/natural/25240d48fc1f4a7c9d49ff41a8c47ad886143048.png" class="postlink">Screenshot</a> (It's slow because it's .png I think, I don't know if XFire can take jpeg screenshots.)<br /><br />I just used a combination of Air-strikes and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081204104841/http://4newbies.planetwolfenstein.gamespy.com/ETQW/images/artillery_gun.jpg" class="postlink">Artillery Gun</a>. Of course I just made sure that my marked location is one that will be populated by the time the rounds get there, it's pretty amazing the amount of damage you can do. On each Air-Strike and Artillery barrage I filled the entire obituary list with kills (NO team kills either! HAH!).<br /><br />You over-exaggerate Phobos!! You're just jealous of my super ownage skills of being constantly awarded with Most Kills!!!! <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081204104841im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />EDIT: Oh and excuse my curse-word in the screenshot...
