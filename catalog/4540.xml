<br /><br />Purpose of this pak file is to clean up the empty shaders etc, missing textures. Making browsing for textures much more enjoyable... I think:) 
<br />Please post bugs here. I ran every map in SP and saw no problems. Now I must get to mapping;)
<br /><br />There are still some errors: I am working on another release in the future, this takes care of a great deal of them though. Some errors seem to break an SP retail map if removed.

<br /><br />Just a quick question, I've copied my Doom3 installation onto another drive, extracted everything from the pak files and then deleted those files (to save space) - I'm doing this so I can keep a squeaky clean standard Doom3 install for testing stuff before releasing.
<br /><br />For some reason, if I put the pak file into this copied version with no pak files, it doesn't read the changes ? - I guess if it doesn't see pak000.pk4 to pak004.pk4 it won't read ?
<br /><br />I tried naming it pak000.pk4, but that didn't work either.
<br /><br />works fine in my standard install tho.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p39957" date="Posted: Sun Aug 22, 2004 7:45 am "><author>Jafo</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Development standards. Anything in a base folder that has the same name as something in a pak file superseeds the pack file. example base/textures/materials/aaduffyTest.mtr would overwrite(maybe the wrong word)  pak004.pk4 which contains the same structure. materials/textures/aaduffyTest.mtr. Only way to use this then that I am aware of is to extract the contents. Hope that helped matt:)
<br /><br />On that note would it be better for me to maybe make this a mod? Suppose then you would just load it in your shortcut.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p39959" date="Posted: Sun Aug 22, 2004 8:09 am "><author>bb_matt</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Yeah - I forgot about that !
<br /><br />I think the way you've done it so far is probably the best - altho I don't know how many other people beside me have extracted all the pak files ?
<br /><br />Wouldn't a mod be too much hastle ?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p39970" date="Posted: Sun Aug 22, 2004 8:53 am "><author>Aphax</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">bb_matt wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Wouldn't a mod be too much hastle ?</div>
<br /><br />I changed from having two seperate Doom 3 installs (one for playing online, one for editting) back to having only one for more harddisk space and simplicity.
<br /><br />Basically I leave the Doom 3\base\ dir alone, and place all my custom content in a moddir Doom 3\dev. I launch my editor with <span style="font-style: italic">+set fs_game dev</span> in the commandline, and that makes the editor load my custom content (materials, maps, etc).  I also extracted all the pak files to somewhere outside my Doom 3 folder which I use as a reference.
<br /><br />I have to say I really like the way I have it now, works very well <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p39974" date="Posted: Sun Aug 22, 2004 9:02 am "><author>bb_matt</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Good idea - I'll give that a try !</div>]]></body></post><post id="p40018" date="Posted: Sun Aug 22, 2004 12:44 pm "><author>def46</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Anyone figured what developer or fs_Devpath do ?
<br /><br />I'm trying to do the same as Aphax above, BUT I want the 'dev' path to be outside the basepath, a completely different path in fact, onto my backup partition, so I never delete my custom data by mistake.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p40077" date="Posted: Sun Aug 22, 2004 3:52 pm "><author>swelt</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Great work, very useful.

<br /><br />Well I have found this to be unnecessary in most cases. The normal alphebetical order of names in PC's is 0-9, then A-Z. So by having named it "00X", you are sure the game will load it last of all... unless of course, you have a pak file named pak010.pk4 (or higher) in the base folder.
<br /><br />But to be 100% covered, why not simply rename the pak to ZZZZ-D3R_fixed_textures.pk4 ? I tried this and the pak file loads just fine.
<br /><br />The 4 Z's at the beginning of the name should make virtually sure it gets loaded absolute last of all no matter how many pak files you have in your base folder and no matter what they are named (unless some fool releases a PAK file that starts with 5 Z's - not likely to happen however).</div>]]></body></post><post id="p40422" date="Posted: Mon Aug 23, 2004 9:09 am "><author>karminax</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">The link seems to be broken</div>]]></body></post><post id="p40446" date="Posted: Mon Aug 23, 2004 11:18 am "><author>MNeMiC</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">yup! and i havnt seen this one before! so please someone host it cuz i want it - badly!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p40459" date="Posted: Mon Aug 23, 2004 12:45 pm "><author>Jafo</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Eutectic wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Great work Jafo, thanks a bunch.

<br />Last actually isn't a good word here... just as long as it is after pak004.pak and then nothing else will interfere like the highrez mod or something like that. If you open your texture browser and still have one faulty texture not loading in alphalabs then something is a miss.
