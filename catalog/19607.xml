<br /><br />We are looking for one level builder/game designer to join our small team at Treyarch. Maybe you're not interested because there is no gravity gun or orbital death ray, but don't make the mistake of thinking it is a boring job. The job of a builder on our team is challenging and you work with a lot of very competitive people who are striving to improve and make you look bad by comparison.
<br /><br />Here are a few pictures of stuff I made for COD3. These were taken before the game was final and are captured directly from the 360.

I finally gave up before the renderer did.

Not only that, our game sold millions of copies and I got a nice royalty check in addition to getting paid to make it to begin with. If you're interested in making stuff like this and think you have the talent to join our small team, please PM me thru the forum message system.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p178990" date="Posted: Fri May 25, 2007 11:13 pm "><author>The Happy Friar</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">moved it to the "mod help wanted" section.
<br /><br />Very nice screens btw.  If the Wii version included MP (like red Steel) I would of gotten that instead of red steel.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Good luck finding help!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p178999" date="Posted: Sat May 26, 2007 1:16 am "><author>Tron</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">unitool wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">The job of a builder on our team is challenging and you work with a lot of very competitive people who are striving to improve and make you look bad by comparison.</div>
<br /><br />That is the best job ad ever. 
<br /><br />I have CoD3 on the Wii, stopped playing about three hours in though when I got too annoyed with a gratuitous "wave the remote and nunchuk to wrestle with your opponent" section I couldn't get past.
<br /><br />edit: Also, isn't this more suitable for the news section?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p179005" date="Posted: Sat May 26, 2007 2:53 am "><author>zeh</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Yes, it's a nice job ad.

<br /><br />Actually I would find a work environment like this very annoying. Aren't teams suppose to support one another? I am a professional level designer and frankly if my team mates were out to make me look bad, I wouldn't be very happy. If I didn't already have a gig - and if the team wasnt' out to get me - I would likely apply.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p179104" date="Posted: Sun May 27, 2007 11:30 am "><author>Rayne</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">DoV_Tomas wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">The job of a builder on our team is challenging and you work with a lot of very competitive people who are striving to improve and make you look bad by comparison. </div><br /><br />Actually I would find a work environment like this very annoying.

<br /><br />The first time I read this thread I missed that point...

When unitool says "competitive" it's more like each builder there is always pushing the engine with some new technique or design that inspires the other builders to do the same and push themselves to do something cooler. It's good for the team/game overall. 
<br /><br />You will learn so much working with these guys. Send in your resume peoples!

<br /><br />They were nothing but an outstanding bunch of people working in a very beautiful part of the states making good games and if it wasn't for the oppurtunity of a life time in my own country of Sweden I would have definately accepted it.
<br /><br />So yeah, go and apply people!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p179334" date="Posted: Wed May 30, 2007 11:09 am "><author>bkt</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">efx wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">So yeah, go and apply people!</div>
