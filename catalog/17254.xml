<br/><br/>
I'm giving animated models a try for the first time and it seems to me from the tutorials that bones are unavoidable, but I thought I'd ask.&#13;
<br/><br/>
I want to make a mesh simulating ocean-waves and 3DS Max offers a very nice animation function for the Noise modifier that'd be perfect but which I can't seem to export as a .md5 file.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Any ideas how this could be accomplished (or how to make waves with bones for that matter).&#13;
<br/><br/>
Thank you and kind regards&#13;

der_ton wrote a 'general exporter' for Max (only iirc) but whilst the game can handle that amount of bones in a single object without too many problems, add collision and IK to that and you've got the potential for some serious slow downs due to the way the game works with physics.&#13;
<br/><br/>
So "yes" you can have tones of bones, but "no", it's not recommened.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="/web/20061013055903/http://www.doom3world.org/" target="_blank" class="postlink"><img src="/web/20061013055903im_/http://www.doom3world.org/site/img/d3w.gif" border="0"/>Co-Admin</a> - <a href="/web/20061013055903/http://www.quake3bits.com/" target="_blank" class="postlink">Modelling and modding tutorials and tips</a></span><span class="gensmall"/></td>
