I forgot which forum I posted on and have just now gotten around to coming here. <br /><br />Well if anyone is interested here is a WIP ase exporter I created.  If you look at the comments at the top of the script it points out a few things I am working on.  I have not completed the vertex color data procedure and I did not test the vertex/face normal data procedure.  there is also one known issue with smoothing groups but I am not even certain it is an issue as I have not finished testing it with the 3DSMax and actorX ase.<br /><br />I believe this to be a stable beta version of the script.  It has been used at my work for a while now with no reported incidents.<br /><br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent"><!-- ia0 -->aseExport.zip<!-- ia0 --></div></div>]]></body></post><post id="p206048" date="Posted: Mon Oct 13, 2008 10:53 pm "><author>DOor</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I am almost done writing one in MEL (yes I know I could make it faster if I used the openAPI and/or python...)
