If need be, drop the scope of the project so you can release something before you run out of time, then once you get home from schoolies, pick it back up and start part2.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p195618" date="Posted: Tue Feb 26, 2008 2:34 pm "><author>wal</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">IMHO: Take your time. If you have to stop for a while then you could release a beta or just wait till it's done. That's better than releasing something you know could have been better. If you know you gunna have to stop for a while then just make sure individual things are complete. It's a nightmare when you leave something half done, even after a couple of days I've found it hard to remember exactly where I was and what I planned to do next.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p201059" date="Posted: Tue Jul 01, 2008 11:32 am "><author>PeppeJ</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Reminds me of Half-Life 2  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121171913im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /></div>]]></body></post></posts></thread></xml>
