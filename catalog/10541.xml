1) enlarge your viewport where your UV map laying, and just take a screenshot.. With photoshop, using the crop tool, crop your canvas leaving only the UV template visible (ok, i must improve my english.. maybe I would post a screenshot)&#13;

THe best workflow from there is to crop it to the size of the UV grid, resize it to what ever size you're making your texture, open u pthe levels dialogue and bring the left slider in to about 130, so everyting is black apart from the Uv outlines,  then set this on top of your texture as a screen.&#13;

 YOu should never use atlas map though.&#13;
<br/>
 Another option is to paint directly on the the model in 3d using deep paint 3d or maxon bodypaint. I usually use this method to project photos on to the model, when doing heads.<br/>_________________<br/>Civillisation will not attain perfection until the last stone, from the last church, falls on the last priest.&#13;
