During that time I checked out other engines and I think that I found an engine that is better suited to what I'm looking for, and that is Platinum Arts Sandbox aka the Cube 2 engine.  I'm always up for ideas and suggestions but I think Cube 2 will do well for us.  Hope you have fun with those planetdoom players <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081115060542im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  Maybe game with pappy-r sometime, he is raving about it in our IRC, come join us sometime <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081115060542im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  Take care.<br />-calimer<br />PS Did you ever see my comments about your map?

You chainsaw_code?  that grenade is pretty damn cool.  I (at first) set the knock to a high negative # &amp; made a blackhole grenade instead.  This the hhg was more fun.  (didn't rule out the blackhole idea though).  I personally like the shotty I made.  Has more of an action movie feel.<br /><br />EDIT: my memory doesn't need to be THAT bad... you have a forum to that torque game in your LMS forums.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081115060542im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p197257" date="Posted: Wed Apr 02, 2008 8:16 am "><author>calimer</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I played your Last Stand mod.  I don't remember your changes to the shotgun and chainsaw, maybe I should check it again.  What was your idea for the blackhole grenade?  That sounds pretty awesome, especially if can actually pull monsters into it.
