It makes seamless animated textures.&#13;<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071030132901/http://www.texturemaker.com/">http://www.texturemaker.com</a><!-- m -->&#13;<br /><br />I downloaded it and tried it out. The interface is a little overwhelming, kinda like photoshop was when I first started with it.&#13;<br /><br />Of course that probably means the learning curve is steep so I don't think I'm going to play with it much. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20071030132901im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20071030132901im_/http://www.texturemaker.com/smp/Stone/burnstone.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20071030132901im_/http://www.texturemaker.com/smp/Nature/Jungle.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />I'm thinking if you were to use this in conjunction with photoshop or perhaps paint shop pro, you could make some awesome materials and particle effects.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p13435" date="Posted: Tue Sep 23, 2003 3:34 am "><author>kat</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">is it me or does that bottom one look like an upsidedown shot of a forest..!?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p13436" date="Posted: Tue Sep 23, 2003 3:38 am "><author>rich_is_bored</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Yeah it does doesn't it? <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20071030132901im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p13437" date="Posted: Tue Sep 23, 2003 4:20 am "><author>Furaeon</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Nah, it's extremely easy.. just has a crapload of buttons. Each of the buttons listed (Basic, Bump, etc) is a category of effects.&#13;<br />It's kinda cheesy, but useful for making texture bases.
