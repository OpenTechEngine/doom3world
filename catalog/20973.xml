For as long as doom 3 has been out, I would think that at least one person might have a good fabric/cloth or carpet texture. I really am trying to do some living-area type stuff but there are no good textures to use for couches or beds etc. I just need a simple cloth texture.<br /><br />Has anyone run across one? Thanks!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p193036" date="Posted: Sun Dec 23, 2007 2:28 am "><author>Dinky</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I suggest making your own!!
