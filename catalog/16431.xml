Then fit your mesh to that skeleton if necessary, but not by manipulating the skeleton, but by manipulating the mesh (for example resize portions of the mesh, or bend the arms so that they match the bindpose of the stock skeleton).<br />Then do the "skinning", which means defining the influences of the bones on vertices (has nothing to do with texturing). In 3dsmax, this is done with the "skin" modifier, and you can use either bone envelopes or vertex painting.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p187406" date="Posted: Mon Aug 27, 2007 10:57 pm "><author>peter_86</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">The bones are in a realy big mess if you don't use the reorient bones option which makes the skinning not realy easy. otherwise if you use the reorient bones option the animations would screw up the geometry.<br /><br />Wouldn't there be a solution how to combine those two so the reoriented bones would work with the animations? id/raven etc. did build the bone structure in a similar way how the bones are after reorientating them so it should be possible shouldn't it?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p189093" date="Posted: Tue Sep 25, 2007 7:37 pm "><author>tintin</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Well I found a way, is to import stock models, then match your model to it, by moving arms legs exactly in same position, then attach it to the stock model (3dsmax) then delete the stock one then most of your skinning will be done, some minor weighting and your done <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081203102407im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p149727" date="Posted: Fri Jul 14, 2006 2:09 pm "><author>Zitheral=WFR</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Are there any tutorials covering the process of taking a character model and bindng the Quake 4 stock player skeleton to it?
