<br /><br />There is quite a bit of work needed in order to get it up to par with GH but just to make it playable it needs...
<br /><br />· to recognize input from the keyboard, or better yet a joystick/gamepad
<br />. to be able to determine hits/misses
<br /><br />Of course, it needs a HUD, music, ect... but that's all superficial.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p178953" date="Posted: Fri May 25, 2007 12:55 pm "><author>pbmax</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">is that anus tube!  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121165856im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p178954" date="Posted: Fri May 25, 2007 1:29 pm "><author>The Happy Friar</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">interesting.

<br /><br />anyway...  it might not be a bad idea to do this in Q4.  Mostly because Q4 has the sound data in the sound shader files &amp; that can be accessed via the SDK, so you can start a "note" to click every time certain sounds are played.
<br /><br />But that's if you wanted to generate the "notes" dynamic, which might not be a great idea.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121165856im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p179224" date="Posted: Mon May 28, 2007 8:55 pm "><author>BlackArmsShadow</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">You know, the concepts behind this idea could prove useful to a lot of people, and I'm all for a GH2 clone in Doom!
<br /><br />A little question though, could GlovePie accept input from a GH Guitar with correspondance to Doom? That would OWN.
<br /><br />Would love to see this finished, or fleshed out at least.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p179272" date="Posted: Tue May 29, 2007 5:35 am "><author>rich_is_bored</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I haven't spent much time thinking about how I'm going to deal with song data yet.
<br /><br />I'm leaning towards entity declarations at the moment. The idea is that I'd use a long list of key/value pairs labeled something like bar_1, bar_2, ect....
<br /><br />Then each bar would contain something like "16 1235" where the first number signifies which notes should be created (binary notation like the way buttons are handled) and the second number would be the time at which they should be created.
<br /><br />I might just have a go without the time bit and just spawn them at intervals. I'm not sure which route to take yet.
<br /><br />At any rate, I had an interesting idea based on the notion that I'd be storing song data within entities. It might be possible to record song data on the fly through the use of the console command saveentities. It's just a thought at this point though since I haven't implemented button input yet.
