<br /><br />Run doom with the following parameters, that should do the trick:
<br /><span style="font-style: italic">doom.exe +com_allowConsole 1 +r_fullscreen 0 +editor</span>
<br /><br />If it doesn't, try adding some +wait calls to the command line like this:
<br /><span style="font-style: italic">doom.exe +com_allowConsole 1 +r_fullscreen 0 +wait +wait +wait +editor</span></div>]]></body></post><post id="p28958" date="Posted: Thu Aug 05, 2004 3:31 pm "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Acid303 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Anyone know how to solve this???

<br /><br />Thanks for the replies, I'll try to get the editor to work with those commands <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />I think i'll stick around here, and read some tutorials, cause i'm new to mapping. Only did some build engine maps for duke 3d (but that's MANY years ago :s).

<br /><br />Please try starting the editor again after switching it off. You can do that in game under <span style="font-style: italic">Options -&gt; System -&gt; Advanced Options</span>.
<br /><br />Hope that helps.
