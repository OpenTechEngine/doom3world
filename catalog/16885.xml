Why did you addnormals if the heightmap is a 1 color grey one?&#13;
<br/>
I mean, heightmaps are used to add some extra details on the bumpmap, or to create a bumpmap with a black &amp; white image.&#13;
<br/>
Your not forced to put an heightmap when you don't need one.&#13;
<br/><br/>
So maybe the engine "bug" with a blank 1 color grey image, just try to make your heightmap a noisy grey one, just to see if the problem disapear...&#13;

<br/><br/>
Now, this is just a test-box I threw together to show you guys what I mean, it's just a box with a slight normalmap indent in the middle.&#13;

<br/><br/>
The diffuse map for this box is just a solid block of color yet you can see how the color has these stretches and banding issues all over it.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Here's another picture of it:&#13;

<br/><br/>
The UV map is a simple planar map, though I've also tried other methods with pretty much the same result.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Does anyone have any idea how to approach this the right way?&#13;
<br/><br/>
Any help is greatly appreciated.&#13;

The only thing I can think of right off hand is that the normalmap is of extremely low resolution, perhaps 128x128 or maybe no more than 256x256.  Pretty much anything less than 256x256 on a gradient like that raised section will probably produce noticeable banding when rendered.  Maybe experiment with higher resolutions (actual image resolution, not screen and be sure to re-render it at the higher res rather than resizing in photoshop or whatever image editor you might use) in renderbumping and see if that makes any difference to the problem.</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

Ok, that actually helped quite a bit but I'm still a bit lost.&#13;
<br/><br/>
I can't seem to get rid of the banding unless I apply a fair amount of noise and I'd like to be able to have a "flat" representation without those artifacts.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Here are some images of my test-object I made to try and prove my point:&#13;
<br/><br/><a href="/web/20061013022219/http://img113.imageshack.us/my.php?image=boxkittenjp8.jpg" target="_blank" class="postlink"><img src="/web/20061013022219im_/http://img113.imageshack.us/img113/3168/boxkittenjp8.th.jpg" border="0"/></a>&#13;
<br/><br/>
yes, it's a kitten heh.&#13;
<br/>
There you can see the banding going beneath the kitten horizontally and then straight down. This is a pattern I see in pretty much all my models.&#13;
<br/><br/><a href="/web/20061013022219/http://imageshack.us/" target="_blank" class="postlink"><img src="/web/20061013022219im_/http://img152.imageshack.us/img152/3269/kittennormaljt5.jpg" border="0"/></a>&#13;
<br/><br/>
This is the normal for the face with the kitten.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Just looking through objects in modview I see tons of objects that don't have anywhere near the artifacts mine does and some of them are very "flat".&#13;
<br/><br/>
Any other ideas?&#13;
<br/><br/>
Thanks again guys,&#13;

Your image above is not "flat".&#13;
<br/><br/>
Is it possible your cube model or the material attached as some sort of "smoothing" applied?&#13;
<br/><br/>
What I did in the past to get real flat normal maps is to separate the normal map detail from the flat cube.&#13;
<br/>
So for a high poly model i made a flat cube with 12 triangles and unwelded edges to disallow the engine any sort of smooth shading.&#13;
<br/><br/>
The detail you can simply map on top of the flat cube (so our inset basically hovers above the cube). The engine doesn't care as it always looks straight on top of every polygon.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Like this:&#13;
<br/><a href="/web/20061013022219/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=1007" target="_blank">http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=1007</a>&#13;
<br/><br/>
If you take the example above but make the face of the square background polygon face the view you'll get a nice total flat normal map background.&#13;
<br/><br/>
I did loads of normal maps with this method and it never posed a problem.&#13;
<br/><a href="/web/20061013022219/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=724" target="_blank">http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=724</a>&#13;
<br/>
(no download atm but images).&#13;
<br/><br/>
To create perfect flatness in an image editing program use:&#13;
<br/>
R: 128 G: 128 B: 255&#13;
<br/><br/>
I've always used this method to get along with normal map creation and the outcome usually is pretty good:&#13;

It's alot to take in for me for some reason. As to your question of wheter some smoothing was involved I have to say I don't think so.&#13;
<br/><br/>
But I tried to do the simplest thing possible which was just have a regular box with no indentions whatsoever and renderbump that. No real point I know but I wanted to see the results and the faces are still all have the gradient shade that messes up the textures for me. I took your suggestion of using the "flat" r g b color and that of course made the texture look great.&#13;
<br/><br/>
So now I'm stuck on why I can't get even the flattest faces to render out flat in the renderbump.&#13;
<br/><br/>
I'm probably coming across as dumb here but any help would thrill me immensely.&#13;
<br/><br/>
TIA,&#13;

In any case you just have to split the faces from each other to break up the smoothing and generate perfectly flat normalmaps.  For blender just select the polygons of one face of the cube and then hit the Y key and confirm you want to split it.

Indeed, it does look like the same thing.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Seems like a simple lack of precision or a compression issue. Something isn't handling the transitioning colors well, and grouping them into clumps. It looks like compressed video, or what happens if you drop your desktop bits to 16 or lower.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Sadly, I have no idea where in the process it might be happening. (I'm a little bit useless on most things artistic.)&#13;
<br/><br/>
Oh, and jpeg isn't the best format to use when showing details like this. It compresses things using a similar method to what the problem looks like.  <img src="/web/20061013022219im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0"/><br/><br/>

The diffuse map for this box is just a solid block of color yet you can see how the color has these stretches and banding issues all over it.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Here's another picture of it:&#13;
<br/><br/><a href="/web/20061013024332/http://img204.imageshack.us/my.php?image=band2ec9.jpg" target="_blank" class="postlink"><img src="/web/20061013024332im_/http://img204.imageshack.us/img204/5922/band2ec9.th.jpg" border="0"/></a>&#13;
<br/><br/>
The UV map is a simple planar map, though I've also tried other methods with pretty much the same result.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Does anyone have any idea how to approach this the right way?&#13;
<br/><br/>
Any help is greatly appreciated.&#13;
<br/><br/>
regards:&#13;

The only thing I can think of right off hand is that the normalmap is of extremely low resolution, perhaps 128x128 or maybe no more than 256x256.  Pretty much anything less than 256x256 on a gradient like that raised section will probably produce noticeable banding when rendered.  Maybe experiment with higher resolutions (actual image resolution, not screen and be sure to re-render it at the higher res rather than resizing in photoshop or whatever image editor you might use) in renderbumping and see if that makes any difference to the problem.</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

Ok, that actually helped quite a bit but I'm still a bit lost.&#13;
<br/><br/>
I can't seem to get rid of the banding unless I apply a fair amount of noise and I'd like to be able to have a "flat" representation without those artifacts.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Here are some images of my test-object I made to try and prove my point:&#13;
<br/><br/><a href="/web/20061013024332/http://img113.imageshack.us/my.php?image=boxkittenjp8.jpg" target="_blank" class="postlink"><img src="/web/20061013024332im_/http://img113.imageshack.us/img113/3168/boxkittenjp8.th.jpg" border="0"/></a>&#13;
<br/><br/>
yes, it's a kitten heh.&#13;
<br/>
There you can see the banding going beneath the kitten horizontally and then straight down. This is a pattern I see in pretty much all my models.&#13;
<br/><br/><a href="/web/20061013024332/http://imageshack.us/" target="_blank" class="postlink"><img src="/web/20061013024332im_/http://img152.imageshack.us/img152/3269/kittennormaljt5.jpg" border="0"/></a>&#13;
<br/><br/>
This is the normal for the face with the kitten.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Just looking through objects in modview I see tons of objects that don't have anywhere near the artifacts mine does and some of them are very "flat".&#13;
<br/><br/>
Any other ideas?&#13;
<br/><br/>

Your image above is not "flat".&#13;
<br/><br/>
Is it possible your cube model or the material attached as some sort of "smoothing" applied?&#13;
<br/><br/>
What I did in the past to get real flat normal maps is to separate the normal map detail from the flat cube.&#13;
<br/>
So for a high poly model i made a flat cube with 12 triangles and unwelded edges to disallow the engine any sort of smooth shading.&#13;
<br/><br/>
The detail you can simply map on top of the flat cube (so our inset basically hovers above the cube). The engine doesn't care as it always looks straight on top of every polygon.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Like this:&#13;
<br/><a href="/web/20061013024332/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=1007" target="_blank">http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=1007</a>&#13;
<br/><br/>
If you take the example above but make the face of the square background polygon face the view you'll get a nice total flat normal map background.&#13;
<br/><br/>
I did loads of normal maps with this method and it never posed a problem.&#13;
<br/><a href="/web/20061013024332/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=724" target="_blank">http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=724</a>&#13;
<br/>
(no download atm but images).&#13;
<br/><br/>
To create perfect flatness in an image editing program use:&#13;
<br/>
R: 128 G: 128 B: 255&#13;
<br/><br/>
I've always used this method to get along with normal map creation and the outcome usually is pretty good:&#13;

It's alot to take in for me for some reason. As to your question of wheter some smoothing was involved I have to say I don't think so.&#13;
<br/><br/>
But I tried to do the simplest thing possible which was just have a regular box with no indentions whatsoever and renderbump that. No real point I know but I wanted to see the results and the faces are still all have the gradient shade that messes up the textures for me. I took your suggestion of using the "flat" r g b color and that of course made the texture look great.&#13;
<br/><br/>
So now I'm stuck on why I can't get even the flattest faces to render out flat in the renderbump.&#13;
<br/><br/>
I'm probably coming across as dumb here but any help would thrill me immensely.&#13;
<br/><br/>
TIA,&#13;

In any case you just have to split the faces from each other to break up the smoothing and generate perfectly flat normalmaps.  For blender just select the polygons of one face of the cube and then hit the Y key and confirm you want to split it.

Indeed, it does look like the same thing.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Seems like a simple lack of precision or a compression issue. Something isn't handling the transitioning colors well, and grouping them into clumps. It looks like compressed video, or what happens if you drop your desktop bits to 16 or lower.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Sadly, I have no idea where in the process it might be happening. (I'm a little bit useless on most things artistic.)&#13;
<br/><br/>
Oh, and jpeg isn't the best format to use when showing details like this. It compresses things using a similar method to what the problem looks like.  <img src="/web/20061013024332im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0"/><br/><br/>

Personally I've never been able to get the D3 engine to turn off smoothing without splitting off faces so I've gotten into a habit (and probably a bad one) of just splitting them rather than dealing with smooth groups.&#13;

Well, I detached the faces of the box as well as cutting out some of the uncesseary edges on said faces.&#13;
<br/><br/>
I can see a little bit of a difference but it's still off. I also had smoothing off afaik.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Here's a before and after image of what I got. The first is the normalmap with before the split off and the second is the result after that.&#13;

<br/><br/>
Well, after much ado (and patience on the part of obihb, thanks again buddy <img src="/web/20061013024559im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0"/> ) I did a little experimenting with Max's render to texture and managed to render some normalmaps that looks fine to me. &#13;
<br/><br/>
However, when I add a heightmap into the equation the random "dots" appear again. Let me try and explain using my very basic testmodel.&#13;
<br/><br/>
This is the image with both the normalmap, heightmap and specularmap all at once.  As you can see there are these "dots" over alot of the image.&#13;
<br/><a href="/web/20061013024559/http://img238.imageshack.us/my.php?image=heightwspecza6.jpg" target="_blank" class="postlink"><img src="/web/20061013024559im_/http://img238.imageshack.us/img238/2006/heightwspecza6.th.jpg" border="0"/></a>&#13;
<br/><br/>
Now, if I take the specmap out it's a little less obvious but still there:&#13;
<br/><a href="/web/20061013024559/http://img179.imageshack.us/my.php?image=heightwithoutspecwn9.jpg" target="_blank" class="postlink"><img src="/web/20061013024559im_/http://img179.imageshack.us/img179/2861/heightwithoutspecwn9.th.jpg" border="0"/></a>&#13;
<br/><br/>
But if I take the heightmap out of the equation those artifacts do go away:&#13;
<br/><a href="/web/20061013024559/http://img79.imageshack.us/my.php?image=normalwspecxz8.jpg" target="_blank" class="postlink"><img src="/web/20061013024559im_/http://img79.imageshack.us/img79/4076/normalwspecxz8.th.jpg" border="0"/></a>&#13;
<br/><br/>
Here's the normalmap, the heightmap and specmap are just base-gray images. I've tried changing them around a bit but it seems just having them there creates this issue for me.&#13;
<br/><br/><a href="/web/20061013024559/http://img109.imageshack.us/my.php?image=normalmapdv7.jpg" target="_blank" class="postlink"><img src="/web/20061013024559im_/http://img109.imageshack.us/img109/2819/normalmapdv7.th.jpg" border="0"/></a>&#13;
<br/><br/>
Here is my mtr file&#13;
<br/></span><table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="3" border="0" align="center"><tr><td><span class="genmed"><b>Code:</b></span></td>	</tr><tr><td class="code">textures/efx/efxBarrell&#13;

<br/>
   specularmap  textures/efxBarrell_s.tga&#13;
<br/>
}</td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody">&#13;
<br/><br/>
So, I hope I have provided enough info!&#13;
<br/><br/>
Any help is appreciated as always!&#13;

Why did you addnormals if the heightmap is a 1 color grey one?&#13;
<br/>
I mean, heightmaps are used to add some extra details on the bumpmap, or to create a bumpmap with a black &amp; white image.&#13;
<br/>
Your not forced to put an heightmap when you don't need one.&#13;
<br/><br/>
So maybe the engine "bug" with a blank 1 color grey image, just try to make your heightmap a noisy grey one, just to see if the problem disapear...&#13;

or just try:&#13;
