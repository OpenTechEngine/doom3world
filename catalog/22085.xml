You definally have to cut the enemies up to kill them.  Always make sure you stomp the dead body too just in case  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081112230447im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /> I've only encountered the basic one so far, so i don't have judgement yet on the ai.<br /><br />Graphics are good, load times are fast, music &amp; sound fx are good and performance is good.  The setting is very doom3, but more atomspheric and less dark.  Game plays like Resident evil 4.  My only gripe so far is the camera, which is a bit awkard to control.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p206465" date="Posted: Thu Oct 23, 2008 3:34 am "><author>Doomguy87</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Hey Dead Space is great and found alot quite original about it, it's just the environment everyone looks at and how the character does stuff. other than that, original: plot, weapons, ways to kill, sounds, Isaac's suit <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081112230447im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" />. very well made.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p206469" date="Posted: Thu Oct 23, 2008 4:20 am "><author>Xhan</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">

Decent graphics at an impressive 15 fps! That was actually tolerable in first person, but third person makes it horribly clunky.<br /><br />I could crank down the graphics, but it's hard to tolerate. The shadows are actually a gameplay element. One section showed a quick shadow movement which hinted that the "dead" enemy was going to pounce. Without shadows that kind of thing is just gone. It's sad.<br /><br />I  need a new PC.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081113073539im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_cry.gif" alt=":cry:" title="Crying or Very sad" /><br /><br />I was going to complain about how PCs are expensive, but then I remembered the ridiculous amount of other stuff I do that I wouldn't be able to do with a console. New PC! Woo! I'll probably up my budget on this one.<br /><br />I have barely played DS, but so far it's cool.

I was instantly reminded of both Doom3 and RE4, and that is not in any way a bad thing if you ask me, both are great games. Dead Space has it's own unique elements as well; like the hud(or lack of) interface for example, so what if it resembles some other well known titles? What is wrong with drawing inspiration from what is already known to be a winning formula? If someone compares it to Doom3 I view that as a complement, I don't see how anyone would view this games as a "clone" of something else Dead Space in my opinion seems to take some of the best elements of a few well known horror games and then some all new never tried elements and mix them together into a survival horror extravaganza. Upon watching the game being played I was thinking to myself: "Yes! This is what I've been wanting". I know I can't afford to upgrade anytime soon, but I'll be getting the children an X-box 360 this Christmas, I think I may just pick this game up for myself.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p206666" date="Posted: Mon Oct 27, 2008 10:50 pm "><author>Brain Trepaning</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Hey, I've got a great idea!

Its only weak spot are the bosses and the boss fights themselves.  Their really bad compared to everything else.  One of them reminded me of a giant std ridden butt shooting glowing pooh at me  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081113073539im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />Even during the later levels when I comfortable with the enemies and all its spookyness, the designers still left a few good tricks up their sleeves to get a few more jumps out of me.  They also didn't abuse tossing too many enemies at you in the later levels for the sake of making things harder like D3 &amp; RE4 did.<br /><br />After finishing it, it didn't remind me of doom3 that much.  I had that feeling starting it out, but the only thing in common in the end was monsters in space.  The story &amp; gameplay made me think of resident evil 4 in space much more than doom.  Its plot was very close to RE4's in my opinion, but they handled it much better, had a couple of good twist and explanations in it to make it stand out further.  Even though I'm really sick of the silent main characters in games, the twist surrounding his small story and why this one guy was a one man army was good.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p207044" date="Posted: Sun Nov 02, 2008 6:13 pm "><author>Sikkpin</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">For those who have played/are playing it on pc, would you mind posting your system specs and in-game settings you are playing it on.

I finally said, "fuck it", went out, bought it, and to my surprise, it runs smooth as butter. Everything maxed, res @ 1024x768 (1280x960 would be ideal but I'm not complaining), VSync &amp; EdgeAA(full screen blur = ugly) off and I haven't noticed any framerate issues yet. I'll put my specs below for others to compare.<br /><br />Now for some opinions. Like the title of this thread, I can't see how no one has not mentioned Doom 3 when making comparisons. The aesthetics and pacing is very much D3-like to me and that's not a bad thing. With the corpses lying everywhere, blood-written messages, complex guis, audio &amp; text logs, video contact with teamates... I could go on. The only thing that makes me think of BioShock is the players suit somewhat resembles the Big Daddy's, at least in material and shading. All in all this is, so far, an incredible game with perfect atmosphere, beautiful lighting/shading, and some nice innovative features. Also it has some of the best lip syncing I've seen, not the overall facial emotions but just the movement of mouth/lips.<br /><br />Now for the Cons. The fucking FOV. The controls are smooth but not very tight no matter the sensitivity (my guess is mouse smooth is hard-coded to be on), which makes aiming, especially when in tight spaces (e.g. enemies right in front of you). Low res world textures (not a big deal but it contrast with the higher res characters/monsters). And a seemingly lack of any kind of anisotropic filtering (again, not a big deal but accompanied with the low fov it makes for flat, featureless surfaces down hallways and such.<br /><br />And before I go, I'll leave a tip for new players: Try to "Use" or "Stomp" anything that glows. <br /><br />System Specs:<br />Pentium 4 3.06 w/ HT<br />1.5 GB DDR3 (I think)<br />GeForce 7600 GT AGP SuperClocked, motherfucker <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081113073539im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> (that's what it says on the box) <br />Windows XP Pro</div>]]></body></post><post id="p207262" date="Posted: Thu Nov 06, 2008 9:51 pm "><author>Kristus</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Yahtzee reviewed it, and he DID mention Doom 3. :p He's a maverick.<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081113073446/http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/333-Dead-Space">http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/ ...
