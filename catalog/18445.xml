<br /><br />I created the megatexture from a large tga and wrote the material shader the same as the one included with the megatexture mod, only substituting the name for the name I had used.

<br /><br />Reading your post again, it looks like that is your problem, it seems you are not using the same name in the model file and for your material. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121165841im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p168048" date="Posted: Mon Jan 22, 2007 12:15 pm "><author>6th Venom</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">

<br /><br />I do have a different problem now. 
<br /><br />The Megatexture does not apply correctly to the UV map coordinates on my mesh. Eg, where there's supposed to be grass, there's dirt instead, etc. - it's like the texture is flipped or rotated incorrectly with relation to the model.
<br /><br />I tested the models uv' coords by applying a normal diffusemap on it ( from the TGA I used to create the megatexture from ) and when using the diffusemap it is applied correctly on the model.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p168745" date="Posted: Mon Jan 29, 2007 10:36 am "><author>Tron</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I think there is a strange thing in the D3 megatexture generation code where it flips the image.
