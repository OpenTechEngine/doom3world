A texture that works in a base doom3 map will not show up in any of my maps. I am talking specifically about the hell pentagrams and some of the blood textures. I looked at the original maps and see that they used a texture, but when I use it, it doesn't show up in either rendered mode or ingame. Wierd though, that it will show up in the editor. Is there some type of fix for this?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p228317" date="Posted: Fri Nov 12, 2010 12:59 pm "><author>rich_is_bored</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Check the placement of the decal in your map versus the vanilla maps.
