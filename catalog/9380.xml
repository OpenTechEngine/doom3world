CTF will hopefully make D3 MP popular and I believe CTF Resources will be better off seperate from the D3Radiant tutorials. Look at the stickies, you can see BSP Options and Compiling Errors, which can be both in the tutorials topic. So I don't find CTF Resources be a sticky silly at all. But then again, I asked if any of D3World staff think that this should be sticky, you said no, that's cool with me. Also those aren't tutorials, those are map/gameplay guides and articles.

<br /><br />Though one difference is the max player count of 8. When a team consists of 4 players, most likely only 1 - 2 people will defend the flag room. So the flag rooms in Doom3 CTF should be a bit more defense friendly (for example, not too many entrances into the flagroom) then in Q3 or UT CTF.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p87113" date="Posted: Sat Apr 09, 2005 4:23 am "><author>Enforcer</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">If anyone has ROE and hasnt played CTF go play it now, its alot of fun with 4 or more people.

<br /><br />One point you forgot in your list: Crossroad. A good CTF map always has at least one crossroad, i.e. a point where all routes between the two bases intersect. Usually this is the center part of the map (middle field or how you want to call it). 
<br />Center Crossroad is both important for defense and offense: defenders have a last chance to catch the enemy flagcarrier before he enters it´s own teams territory, and offense tries to control the crossroads get the quad damage (or other important powerup which is located in the center of the map) before starting an assault on the enemy base.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p92301" date="Posted: Tue May 03, 2005 10:36 pm "><author>Method</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Tetzlaff wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">Method wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">You can find them in the textures/ctf folder.

<br /><br />Good point, Tetzlaff.
<br />Good CTF map has to be atleast 3 rooms (blue base, red base and center area). The rooms you talk about are called choke-points and since central area is a choke-point connecting two bases, I didn't mention it on the common things list.

A choke point can also be a tight, frequently used entrance to the base. What I mean was often called middle field or midfield in Q2 CTF design, crossroad or just center or middle of the map or other fuzzy terms. I think soemthing like crossroads or center crossroad is the best name, because it refers to the intersecting routes, which is the defining part.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p92349" date="Posted: Wed May 04, 2005 7:05 am "><author>Method</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Taken from one of Q2 CTF LD tutorials:
<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic">"Choke point(s).  The best maps being played right now have at least 1 choke point.  Simply put a choke point is like a funnel -- players coming from various rooms are "funneled" through a specific area of the map.  There can be several of these, but it's best to not have too many.  Having 10 distinct, separate hallways between bases will frustrate defenders and after a while there will be nobody left but flag runners.  If you want a lot of action, limit the choke points."</span>

<br /><br />One point you forgot in your list: Crossroad. A good CTF map always has at least one crossroad, i.e. a point where all routes between the two bases intersect. Usually this is the center part of the map (middle field or how you want to call it).

<br /><br />Good point, Tetzlaff.
<br />Good CTF map has to be atleast 3 rooms (blue base, red base and center area). The rooms you talk about are called choke-points and since central area is a choke-point connecting two bases, I didn't mention it on the common things list.

A choke point can also be a tight, frequently used entrance to the base.

<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic">"Choke point(s).  The best maps being played right now have at least 1 choke point.  Simply put a choke point is like a funnel -- players coming from various rooms are "funneled" through a specific area of the map.  There can be several of these, but it's best to not have too many.  Having 10 distinct, separate hallways between bases will frustrate defenders and after a while there will be nobody left but flag runners.  If you want a lot of action, limit the choke points."</span>

<br /><br />One point you forgot in your list: Crossroad. A good CTF map always has at least one crossroad, i.e. a point where all routes between the two bases intersect. Usually this is the center part of the map (middle field or how you want to call it). 
<br />Center Crossroad is both important for defense and offense: defenders have a last chance to catch the enemy flagcarrier before he enters it´s own teams territory, and offense tries to control the crossroads get the quad damage (or other important powerup which is located in the center of the map) before starting an assault on the enemy base.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p92301" date="Posted: Tue May 03, 2005 10:36 pm "><author>Method</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Tetzlaff wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">Method wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">You can find them in the textures/ctf folder.

<br /><br />Good point, Tetzlaff.
<br />Good CTF map has to be atleast 3 rooms (blue base, red base and center area). The rooms you talk about are called choke-points and since central area is a choke-point connecting two bases, I didn't mention it on the common things list.

<br /><br />One point you forgot in your list: Crossroad. A good CTF map always has at least one crossroad, i.e. a point where all routes between the two bases intersect. Usually this is the center part of the map (middle field or how you want to call it). 
<br />Center Crossroad is both important for defense and offense: defenders have a last chance to catch the enemy flagcarrier before he enters it´s own teams territory, and offense tries to control the crossroads get the quad damage (or other important powerup which is located in the center of the map) before starting an assault on the enemy base.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p92301" date="Posted: Tue May 03, 2005 10:36 pm "><author>Method</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Tetzlaff wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">Method wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">You can find them in the textures/ctf folder.

<br /><br />Good point, Tetzlaff.
<br />Good CTF map has to be atleast 3 rooms (blue base, red base and center area). The rooms you talk about are called choke-points and since central area is a choke-point connecting two bases, I didn't mention it on the common things list.

A choke point can also be a tight, frequently used entrance to the base. What I mean was often called middle field or midfield in Q2 CTF design, crossroad or just center or middle of the map or other fuzzy terms. I think soemthing like crossroads or center crossroad is the best name, because it refers to the intersecting routes, which is the defining part.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p92349" date="Posted: Wed May 04, 2005 7:05 am "><author>Method</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Taken from one of Q2 CTF LD tutorials:
<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic">"Choke point(s).  The best maps being played right now have at least 1 choke point.  Simply put a choke point is like a funnel -- players coming from various rooms are "funneled" through a specific area of the map.  There can be several of these, but it's best to not have too many.  Having 10 distinct, separate hallways between bases will frustrate defenders and after a while there will be nobody left but flag runners.  If you want a lot of action, limit the choke points."</span>

But then again, I asked if any of D3World staff think that this should be sticky, you said no, that's cool with me. Also those aren't tutorials, those are map/gameplay guides and articles.

<br /><br />Though one difference is the max player count of 8. When a team consists of 4 players, most likely only 1 - 2 people will defend the flag room.

I was having a look though the standard d3 assets - theres a blue set of wall textures - its quite easy to colour replace them in photoshop to red - I was thinking of converting them for ctf and using the existing normal maps etc. I dont know if thats a EULA breaker ?&#13;

One point you forgot in your list: Crossroad. A good CTF map always has at least one crossroad, i.e. a point where all routes between the two bases intersect. Usually this is the center part of the map (middle field or how you want to call it). &#13;
<br/>
Center Crossroad is both important for defense and offense: defenders have a last chance to catch the enemy flagcarrier before he enters itÃÂ´s own teams territory, and offense tries to control the crossroads get the quad damage (or other important powerup which is located in the center of the map) before starting an assault on the enemy base.</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

Good point, Tetzlaff.&#13;
<br/>
Good CTF map has to be atleast 3 rooms (blue base, red base and center area). The rooms you talk about are called choke-points and since central area is a choke-point connecting two bases, I didn't mention it on the common things list.&#13;

One point you forgot in your list: Crossroad. A good CTF map always has at least one crossroad, i.e. a point where all routes between the two bases intersect. Usually this is the center part of the map (middle field or how you want to call it). &#13;
<br/>
Center Crossroad is both important for defense and offense: defenders have a last chance to catch the enemy flagcarrier before he enters itÃÂ´s own teams territory, and offense tries to control the crossroads get the quad damage (or other important powerup which is located in the center of the map) before starting an assault on the enemy base.</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

Good point, Tetzlaff.&#13;
<br/>
Good CTF map has to be atleast 3 rooms (blue base, red base and center area). The rooms you talk about are called choke-points and since central area is a choke-point connecting two bases, I didn't mention it on the common things list.&#13;

One point you forgot in your list: Crossroad. A good CTF map always has at least one crossroad, i.e. a point where all routes between the two bases intersect. Usually this is the center part of the map (middle field or how you want to call it). &#13;
<br/>
Center Crossroad is both important for defense and offense: defenders have a last chance to catch the enemy flagcarrier before he enters itÃÂ´s own teams territory, and offense tries to control the crossroads get the quad damage (or other important powerup which is located in the center of the map) before starting an assault on the enemy base.</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

Good point, Tetzlaff.&#13;
<br/>
Good CTF map has to be atleast 3 rooms (blue base, red base and center area). The rooms you talk about are called choke-points and since central area is a choke-point connecting two bases, I didn't mention it on the common things list.&#13;

Simply put a choke point is like a funnel -- players coming from various rooms are "funneled" through a specific area of the map.  There can be several of these, but it's best to not have too many.  Having 10 distinct, separate hallways between bases will frustrate defenders and after a while there will be nobody left but flag runners.

CTF will hopefully make D3 MP popular and I believe CTF Resources will be better off seperate from the D3Radiant tutorials. Look at the stickies, you can see BSP Options and Compiling Errors, which can be both in the tutorials topic. So I don't find CTF Resources be a sticky silly at all. But then again, I asked if any of D3World staff think that this should be sticky, you said no, that's cool with me. Also those aren't tutorials, those are map/gameplay guides and articles.&#13;

Though one difference is the max player count of 8. When a team consists of 4 players, most likely only 1 - 2 people will defend the flag room. So the flag rooms in Doom3 CTF should be a bit more defense friendly (for example, not too many entrances into the flagroom) then in Q3 or UT CTF.</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>
