Monsters come out, side area becomes accessible. Door panel has to stay in opened state forever after door was unlocked.<br />I's basicly just a typical monster closet with some additional rooms behind it.<br /><br />This is what I tried:<br /><br />Made a door: <br /><br />no_touch 1<br />locked 1<br />wait -1 (so the door panel would stay open after unlocking)<br /><br />Made a trigger_once. Made a target_lock. Connected trigger_once with target_lock, then connected target_lock with the door.<br /><br />In game, nothing happens when I pass through the trigger. What am I doing wrong?<br /><br />I tried applying "locked" "0" or "1" to the target_lock entity, but that doesn't help.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p240334" date="Posted: Fri Jun 29, 2012 3:47 pm "><author>Sikkpin</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Try targeting the door with the trigger instead of through the target_lock.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p240371" date="Posted: Sun Jul 01, 2012 1:02 pm "><author>Tetzlaff</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thanks Sikkpin! That worked.<br /><br />What was the mistake I made with the target_lock? Just curious.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p240397" date="Posted: Mon Jul 02, 2012 1:33 am "><author>Sikkpin</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I don't know. target_lock is Quake 4 specific so someone who's more familiar with Quake 4 editing would have to tell you. Or check Raven's maps and see if and how they used them.</div>]]></body></post></posts></thread></xml>
