Is it possible to run OSX in a virtual machine?</div><br />The PearPC project did this (PPC emulator). I tried it once but couldn't get the virtual NIC working so it was pretty useless to me in that state.<br /><br />I have read that VMWare have a virtualisation environment for OSX but Apple won't let them release it. Don't know how accurate that is.<br /><br />There are hacked ISO images of OSX out there that can be used to run it on standard VMWare, apparently, but thats not the sort of road I personally want to travel.</div>]]></body></post></posts></thread></xml>
