So I guess first task is to add SIMD optimization for 64bit build, then thread it (which seems to be a royal pita).<br /><br />Fun fact - after building 64bit build on Windows with MSVC 2010 Express, dhewm3 shows that it uses generic SIMD instructions. Same code compiled with gcc on Linux shows it uses MMX/SSE and SSE2. Go figure.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p244155" date="Posted: Mon Nov 12, 2012 6:43 pm "><author>reckless</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">64 bit optimization is pretty hard stuff especially on code that was not built with a 64 bit OS in mind from the start.<br />Also a lot of the integral stuff like int's long's etc. have other sizes on 64 bit which can fubar pretty much anything if not corrected.<br />Luckily most modern compilers come with pointer types of those that set the correct size depending on what arch you build for (uintptr_t -&gt; unsigned int intptr_t -&gt; int etc).<br />Its still a heck of a load of work though <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319224718im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p244156" date="Posted: Mon Nov 12, 2012 6:49 pm "><author>motorsep</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">@reckless: I am sure you got my pm <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319224718im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> Could you please reply to it in pm ?<br /><br />dhewm3 ported to 64bit platforms properly. Not 100% perhaps since there is a collision bug that only happens in 64bit build. However, all the types that needed to be converted were converted. I guess it was rather painful to write SIMD assembly code for 64bit platform, thus dhewm3 devs decided to leave it for someone else <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319224718im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p244157" date="Posted: Mon Nov 12, 2012 7:41 pm "><author>reckless</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">My guess also <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319224718im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />Im not at home atm helping a friend move but i read your pm and atm my hands are pretty much full <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319224718im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><br />Ill see if i can help when i got my current stuff worked out.</div>]]></body></post></posts></thread></xml>
