I read in this forum somewhere that the default install dir for q4 can cause problems so I reinstalled q4 in c:/Quake4 (no spaces) and I went as far as reinstalling radiant (dont think that was necessary but did it all the same) So basically I am running a fresh install of everything but the problem remains. Alot of the shaders work but I'd say at least half of the common shaders dont work and quite a few others.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p190064" date="Posted: Sat Oct 13, 2007 11:36 pm "><author>rich_is_bored</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">You're probably looking at broken shaders.<br /><br />There are quite a few material shaders that reference images that were not shipped with the game. Because neither GTK nor the built in editors validate the shaders before listing them, you end up with a lot of materials that appear not to work.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p227767" date="Posted: Mon Oct 04, 2010 7:58 pm "><author>Tach</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Hi,<br /><br />I think I've got the same problem, everytime I open a map it shows "shader not found" for nearly every texture.<br />You can see it in the screenshot:<br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225132311/http://www.imagebanana.com/view/z8iqucxh/shadernotfound.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225132311im_/http://img3.imagebanana.com/img/z8iqucxh/thumb/shadernotfound.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br /><br />It seems like 90% of the nice textures are missing. x(<br />I'm using the GtkRadiant 1.5.0<br /><br />I also tried to export the textures+materials from the pk4 files but this doesn't help to solve the problem.<br /><br />I think the problem is the following file, but I'm not sure:<br />Q4\GtkRadiant\q4.game\q4base\default_shaderlist.txt<br />This file is empty. o.O<br /><br />Maybe someone has got an idea?  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225132311im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p227768" date="Posted: Mon Oct 04, 2010 9:06 pm "><author>reko</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Tach wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Hi,<br /><br />I think I've got the same problem, everytime I open a map it shows "shader not found" for nearly every texture.<br />You can see it in the screenshot:<br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225132311/http://www.imagebanana.com/view/z8iqucxh/shadernotfound.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225132311im_/http://img3.imagebanana.com/img/z8iqucxh/thumb/shadernotfound.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br /><br />It seems like 90% of the nice textures are missing. x(<br />I'm using the GtkRadiant 1.5.0<br /><br />I also tried to export the textures+materials from the pk4 files but this doesn't help to solve the problem.<br /><br />I think the problem is the following file, but I'm not sure:<br />Q4\GtkRadiant\q4.game\q4base\default_shaderlist.txt<br />This file is empty. o.O<br /><br />Maybe someone has got an idea?  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225132311im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div><br /><br />My suggestion, get your map on D3 Radiant.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p227769" date="Posted: Mon Oct 04, 2010 9:25 pm "><author>Tach</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Excuse me, what is D3?<br /><br />Edit:<br />Ah, k Doom3 Radiant... but this one should also work well with Q4 and D3.<br />I think when I use the integrated D3 editor, It's nearly the same like using the integrated Q4 editor.<br /><br />But I wanna use the GTK. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225132311im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)" title="Wink" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p227770" date="Posted: Mon Oct 04, 2010 9:36 pm "><author>reko</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Tach wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Excuse me, what is D3?<br /><br />Edit:<br />Ah, k Doom3 Radiant... but this one should also work well with Q4 and D3.<br />I think when I use the integrated D3 editor, It's nearly the same like using the integrated Q4 editor.<br /><br />But I wanna use the GTK. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225132311im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)" title="Wink" /></div><br /><br />What's the difference?

I think something may have gotten removed from DR in terms of the maps, everything else seems to load fine.  I can use the model viewer to select models.  The console is basically saying that it's expecting version 2 map, but finding a version 3...so there are some differences that must be accounted for.  GTK Radiant source code is still available, so it should be possible to get this back up and running...at least for idtech 4 games like Q4 and Prey.  Of course, it wouldn't be an officially supported feature, but it would be nice to allow the community to use our editor and perhaps help develop plugins for it.<br /><br />Currently our lead coder greebo is working on a particle viewer.  If someone in the community cared to write a particle editor plugin to go along with this, it would certainly be a nice bonus.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225132311im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225132311im_/http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc4/hs824.snc4/68449_10150296174660788_644095787_15377802_2730850_n.jpg" alt="Image" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p227927" date="Posted: Thu Oct 14, 2010 9:59 pm "><author>zorius</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Here is a screenshot from my q4 map, with official textures, which are working perfectly in one of the latest gtkradiant 1.5 build:<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225132311/http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_A57o81jdOKI/TLdXIfyAIAI/AAAAAAAAANo/C8sW3Lb9mYU/s1600/radiant_1.5_q4.jpg" class="postlink">http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_A57o81jdOKI/TLdXIfyAIAI/AAAAAAAAANo/C8sW3Lb9mYU/s1600/radiant_1.5_q4.jpg</a></div>]]></body></post><post id="p227934" date="Posted: Fri Oct 15, 2010 1:53 pm "><author>Tach</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Nice.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225132311im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /> But how do you did that?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p228004" date="Posted: Sat Oct 23, 2010 12:15 pm "><author>zorius</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Tell me, for example which shader (texture) doesn't work?
