Basically, if you've played singleplayer you've seen dead bodies that will stand up and come after you, with or without you knowing.
<br /><br />First, only certain zombies will be able to do this. I know the fat zombie model doesn't have the required animations so that one can't. I'll be using monster_zombie_maint_bald.
<br /><br />Now, plop down the zombie monster where you want the dead body to be. Select it and go to the entity editor (Press 'N'). One thing you may want to do that is not required is to play the animation 'getup1pose'. This will make the zombie lie down in the editor. I use this so I know what zombies are ambushers and which aren't.
<br /><br />Next, there are a few settings on the zombie that need changing. In the entity editor, change the following keys:
<br /><br />anim - getup1pose
<br />This one makes the zombie loop said animation until it does something else. This animation is the zombie laying down appearing dead.
<br /><br />on_activate - getup1
<br />This one makes the zombie play said animation when it spots the player. The animation getup1 is synchronized with getup1pose so it flows seamlessly from pose to normal.
<br /><br />wake_on_attackcone - 1
<br />This one makes the zombie stay dormant (looping getup1pose) until the player enters its attack cone. The zombie will also rise to defend himself (but still play 'getup1') if shot at, either by a paranoid player who suspects all dead bodies or a missed shot <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100522162934im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />.
<br /><br />no_idle_chatter - 1
<br />This will prevent the zombie from playing his idle sounds (such as random grunts and moans) at all times. This is only IDLE sounds so it will still moan and groan during combat and pursuit and such. If this were set to 0, you'd 'hear' the seemingly dead bodies (which can still be somewhat disconcerting <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100522162934im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />) and it sort of gives it away <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100522162934im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />.
<br /><br />(optional setting)
<br />ignore_flashlight - 1
<br />By default this is 0. When it is set to 1, the zombie will not be awakened (and then play 'getup1' and move to attack the player) by a flashlight shining at them. If set to 0, the zombie will react to a flashlight as they would a player getting too close.
<br /><br /><br />Thats about it. Also make sure the zombies feet are aiming at where you want the player to trigger it. From here, you could fiddle with the 'attack_cone' key to make the zombie trigger from further than at it's feet. When I figure out how attack_cone is set up i'll add it here. Hope this helps, now go scare the crap out of some players <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100522162934im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil" />.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p32752" date="Posted: Wed Aug 11, 2004 7:59 am "><author>PsychoDad</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Tnx, very nice.

<br /><br />Yes. Just point the trigger at him. Thats all. If you don't want him to get up when you get close to him, set wake_on_attackcone back to 0.

<br /><br />I think I know what your talking about, make sure you haven't accidently set 'walk_on_sight' to 1. That will skip the animation so you don't want that. If that isn't your problem, copy your zombie into a box map or something and e-mail it to me and i'll see if I can figure out the problem.
<br /><br /><span style="color: red">E-Mail: -------- ---- ------- ----- --- Removed.</span>
<br />Im sure you can figure out my email from that. Just remove the spam bot thing and turn the [at] and [dot] into the proper symbol.
<br /><br />EDIT: If you do e-mail it to me, tell me on here via post, I don't check me e-mail all too often <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100522162934im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />.

I want the player to walk over him and not have him activate, then when the player hits a trigger_once (beyond the zombie) I want the zombie to get up.
<br /><br />So far I've seen that could help but I dont understand how, is
<br /><br />animte_z
<br />or
<br />hide
<br /><br />hide seems the best, it says "makes nonsolid until triggered" which is what I want, but I don't want him to be invisible..
<br /><br />Any help appreciated.

<br /><br />Is there a bench model of some sort.. I can't seem to find one.
