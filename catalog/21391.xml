Or just straight to a game engine?<br /><br />When it comes to modeling, there are a variety of ways that artists model characters. Some people, like in the tutorial you're following, do whats called "Box" modeling, starting from a box and adding detail as they go. Other people start from a single polygon plane and extrude edges until they complete their model.<br /><br />I tend to use a bunch of different techniques depending on the model I'm making or what part of the model I'm making. If I were making a foot or something like that, I usually start from a box. But if I'm making a head/face, I model polygon by polygon.<br /><br />I'll create a single polygon plane with 4 verticies, go into my front camera view and place my polygon plane on a part of the face (I usually start at the bottom eyelid). Then, I click an edge and I use the Extrude Edge command and shape that new polygon face according to my reference plane.<br /><br />I was never able to get a handle on starting from a box or starting from a sphere to do most pieces of a characters body. If I weren't so sick, I would post more; but I'm going to eat some soup.<br /><br />EDIT: Also, your "Z-fighting" issue sounds like either of a few things. Right now I can only think of 2. <br /><br />Either 1) You need to adjust your camera's scale settings in it's properties until it doesn't do this anymore. I don't know how to do this in 3dsmax, I work in Maya.<br /><br />or 2) You have extruded faces incorrectly by accident and created non-manifold geometry. For your sake, I hope it's the first one. Non-manifold geometry can be a bitch sometimes, especially if you don't know how to fix it. Basically it means you have a polygon face on top of a polygon face, they share verticies and they exact same xyz location. At least I think that's what it is... I can't remember, I'm sick.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p197254" date="Posted: Wed Apr 02, 2008 12:13 am "><author>Bo$bevok</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">hey dinky thanks for the reply. <br />im gonna give the head a go tommorow using your technique.<br /><br />the issue with z-fighting is definately not the second one but i dont know how to get rid of it with the camera... oh well its nothing major.<br /><br />again, thanks alot<br /><br />EDIT : By the way i dont have any sculpting software and i've already used up my z-brush trial.... i'll see what i can find.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p197269" date="Posted: Wed Apr 02, 2008 6:37 pm "><author>Dinky</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Bo$bevok wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">hey dinky thanks for the reply. <br />im gonna give the head a go tommorow using your technique.<br /><br />the issue with z-fighting is definately not the second one but i dont know how to get rid of it with the camera... oh well its nothing major.<br /><br />again, thanks alot<br /><br />EDIT : By the way i dont have any sculpting software and i've already used up my z-brush trial.... i'll see what i can find.</div><br /><br />I believe Blender has sculpting solutions in its software, but I don't mess with Blender much.<br /><br />If you want to find cheaper high-res sculpting solutions, take a look at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205143554/http://nevercenter.com/about/" class="postlink">Silo 3d</a> for a start.
