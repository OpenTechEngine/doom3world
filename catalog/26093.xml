Especially when you can start most stuff.<br /><br />I did a little research on that. When starting the engine you will get lots of warnings and errors because of missing files and definitions. Sometimes you won't even get those and still something is missing. (Had that problem particularly with particleeffects.)<br />Most of the missing files I could get from the demo of Doom3. <br />As the demo is free to get and use, you can do that too. And with that you will have all you need.<br />Here is the German paper about the stuff I did: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319224135/https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B-DgjzoFZxxwTFl4em53UnRwYnc/edit">https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B-Dgjzo ... RwYnc/edit</a><!-- m --><br />I haven't yet made the "extended" pack public because it contains assets from Doom3 demo. From what I could read from the license, I'm not allowed to put those out in public. Still someone could write a script to extract the files from the demo and use them. Or get in contact with id or Zenimax and ask them if it's OK to use them.<br /><br />For now I just can give you a link via pm to the archive if you like.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p245255" date="Posted: Wed Jan 02, 2013 10:54 am "><author>whitewolf</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">@Urfoex<br /><br />There are 2 minimal asset packs, the one Cire posted and the one mentioned in the OP.

As far as I experienced you will e.g. need the shader stuff. There you have about 3 possibilities:<br />1) use the ARB shaders coming with Doom3 or Doom3 demo<br />2) use the GLSL shaders coming from Dante (<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319224135/https://github.com/omcfadde/dante">https://github.com/omcfadde/dante</a><!-- m -->, <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319224135/https://github.com/omcfadde/gl2progs">https://github.com/omcfadde/gl2progs</a><!-- m -->)<br />3) use the GLSL shaders coming from Doom3 BFG (<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319224135/https://github.com/id-Software/DOOM-3-BFG">https://github.com/id-Software/DOOM-3-BFG</a><!-- m -->)<br />Funny thing: the D3BFG GLSL shaders are open source, the D3 ARB shaders not.<br /><br />Second: there are some files like light-textures and light-definitions you also need. They aren't in the asset-packs. You might find warnings in the console about those missing stuffs. Then you have the choice to create those or use the ones that are there.<br /><br />The files from the demo are mostly 1on1 the ones from the full version. So most of them you can't distinguish.<br />Not to talk about the EULA coming with the demo referencing the full version and not talking about the demo <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319224135im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)" title="Wink" /><br />I mailed Zenimax asking about demo-file usage but haven't heard back. Would be nice to have a free starter pack with all those free files available included.<br /><br />Also looking at mods like sikk-mod (<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319224135/http://www.moddb.com/mods/sikkmod">http://www.moddb.com/mods/sikkmod</a><!-- m -->) I see lots of files from the full version included. And as I know the mod is still available and its creator isn't in jail for it.<br /><br />Yeah. I made the pdf. But most of it is external stuff like Fabien Sanglards D3 code review <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319224135/http://fabiensanglard.net/doom3/index.php">http://fabiensanglard.net/doom3/index.php</a><!-- m -->, and things from <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130319224135/http://www.iddevnet.com/doom3">http://www.iddevnet.com/doom3</a><!-- m --> .
