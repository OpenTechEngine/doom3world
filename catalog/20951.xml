Simple!<br /><br />When you have a folder window open, go to Tools&gt;Folder Options&gt;View... Then scroll down in that little box, and under "Hidden Files and Folders" you will see "Hide Extensions for Known File Types", uncheck the box next to it.<br /><br />After that, go to your file you want to convert, delete the extension and change it to .pk4. Tada!<br /><br />Be aware that now, everything from .txt files to .exe files will have the extension at the end revealed and you CAN accidentally delete it or change it. Get used to avoiding deleting that part when you rename files.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p192909" date="Posted: Fri Dec 21, 2007 2:44 am "><author>KC Clark</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">AWESOME!
