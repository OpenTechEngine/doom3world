I'm working on the grip underneath the barrel, but it looks fugly because it is very low poly. What are the possible ways to turn it into a round-edged object? I can't use subdivision because it has more than 4 vertices on that one particular polygon (the one that looks like a 'W' in the Perspective window). All help appreciated thanks!</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

First you can apply the "Triple" command to your surface.. after you did that you should be able to subdivide. &#13;
<br/><br/>
another method would be to build your part direct in detail ... &#13;

I'd say you better don't triple the polys before you subdivide them - it works best with quads rather than triangles.&#13;
<br/>
Just make sure you don't have polys with more than four vertices.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="/web/20061012183016/http://www.doom3world.org/" target="_blank" class="postlink"><img src="/web/20061012183016im_/http://www.doom3world.org/site/img/d3w.gif" border="0"/> Staff - The world is yours</a>, soon in 6 degrees of freedom!&#13;

that sucks <img src="/web/20061012183016im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0"/> I like to work with x sided non planar subdivided polys in XSI, that do I add edges in.&#13;
<br/><br/>
like the lower part of a high res face is just 1 subdivided polygon, then I can just add all edge loops for all the detail on that subdiveded polygon.&#13;
<br/><br/>
If i'm not happy, i just delete the edges I don't need and redo it&#13;
<br/><br/>
in the end I will ofcourse try to end up with only quads <img src="/web/20061012183016im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0"/><br/><br/><br/>
