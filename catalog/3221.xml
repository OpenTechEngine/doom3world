<br /><br />Don't post "my new map" or I'll kill you, literally speaking.
<br /><br />Give it a name like yournick_dm_1 or whatever and use that as headline, please!
<br /><br />As the first two letters in the headline please add "SP" for single player or "MP" for multi player.
<br /><br />Posting screenshots is very fine, yet please don't throw in 20 screens at 1600*1200 - limit yourself to 3 or 4 good shots or the special cases you want to show off. The maximum image size width shouldn't be over 640 pixels - if you have higher resolution images, please post text links to them.
<br /><br />If not I'll edit them out completely - not everyone has broadband, let alone the fact that the page will become unreadable...
<br /><br />If you have gathered enough feedback and tweaked your map to the max, then release it in the Maps Final forum with the SAME headline.
<br /><br />When done so add the link to the Final version to your thread in the Maps WIP forum - so you increase chances that your map will get more playtime by people who only follow one of the forums.
<br /><br />In the Final Maps forum add also a link to the Maps WIP thread to spare the people searching around. The web was meant to find and share information faster and easier - not to confuse people and steal their time.
<br /><br />If you do different versions of your map, DON'T start a new thread for each one please!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p34722" date="Posted: Fri Aug 13, 2004 12:56 pm "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">
