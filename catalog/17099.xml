<br /><br />Got some questions. I was wondering if someone could make the helmeted Medic and Techmarine playable in multi-play. Is such a thing possible?
<br /><br />Also how about your hands holding the gun? I mean, I would like to see the yellow brightskin grabbing the nailgun when I choose to be Pro Strogg! Could that be done? Thanks in advance!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p156104" date="Posted: Tue Sep 05, 2006 6:11 pm "><author>Krublokk</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Hello
