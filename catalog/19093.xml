<br /><br />There are lots of good examples for round arch constructions in modern architecture.
<br />Check out Alameda subway station in Valencia by Santiago Calatrava for that. Fosters Faculty of Law in Cambridge is a nice example for a modern arch construction as well. And then there´s an awesome industrial building by Samyn and Partners in Belgium.

<br /><br />There are lots of good examples for round arch constructions in modern architecture.
<br />Check out Alameda subway station in Valencia by Santiago Calatrava for that. Fosters Faculty of Law in Cambridge is a nice example for a modern arch construction as well. And then there´s an awesome industrial building by Samyn and Partners in Belgium.
<br /><br />All of theser are not the typical doomesque hightech  style but you can extrapolate from there.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p174398" date="Posted: Tue Mar 27, 2007 11:20 pm "><author>elusive</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">cool!

<br /><br />yeah, maybe you could wear them down even more, remove some parts/panels of the textures exposing cables/machinery behind them, go a bit deeper into the wall these panels are covering.
<br />You've got some realy nice base models/textures to play around with and I think this whole theme you're working on could be developed alot further with some experimentation.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p174644" date="Posted: Fri Mar 30, 2007 7:01 pm "><author>elusive</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">@Skutarth

<br />have you thought about baking a mask for behind the panel? Im not sure what app you're using for projection but if you can assign different colours to the high poly model you could bake some masks which could then be selected in photoshop.

<br /><br />There are lots of good examples for round arch constructions in modern architecture.
<br />Check out Alameda subway station in Valencia by Santiago Calatrava for that. Fosters Faculty of Law in Cambridge is a nice example for a modern arch construction as well. And then there´s an awesome industrial building by Samyn and Partners in Belgium.
<br /><br />All of theser are not the typical doomesque hightech  style but you can extrapolate from there.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p174398" date="Posted: Wed Mar 28, 2007 12:20 am "><author>elusive</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">cool!

<br /><br />yeah, maybe you could wear them down even more, remove some parts/panels of the textures exposing cables/machinery behind them, go a bit deeper into the wall these panels are covering.

<br /><br />There are lots of good examples for round arch constructions in modern architecture.
<br />Check out Alameda subway station in Valencia by Santiago Calatrava for that. Fosters Faculty of Law in Cambridge is a nice example for a modern arch construction as well. And then there´s an awesome industrial building by Samyn and Partners in Belgium.
<br /><br />All of theser are not the typical doomesque hightech  style but you can extrapolate from there.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p174398" date="Posted: Wed Mar 28, 2007 12:20 am "><author>elusive</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">cool!

<br /><br />yeah, maybe you could wear them down even more, remove some parts/panels of the textures exposing cables/machinery behind them, go a bit deeper into the wall these panels are covering.
<br />You've got some realy nice base models/textures to play around with and I think this whole theme you're working on could be developed alot further with some experimentation.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p174644" date="Posted: Fri Mar 30, 2007 7:01 pm "><author>elusive</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">@Skutarth

<br />have you thought about baking a mask for behind the panel? Im not sure what app you're using for projection but if you can assign different colours to the high poly model you could bake some masks which could then be selected in photoshop.

<br /><br />There are lots of good examples for round arch constructions in modern architecture.
<br />Check out Alameda subway station in Valencia by Santiago Calatrava for that. Fosters Faculty of Law in Cambridge is a nice example for a modern arch construction as well. And then there´s an awesome industrial building by Samyn and Partners in Belgium.

<br /><br />There are lots of good examples for round arch constructions in modern architecture.
<br />Check out Alameda subway station in Valencia by Santiago Calatrava for that. Fosters Faculty of Law in Cambridge is a nice example for a modern arch construction as well. And then there´s an awesome industrial building by Samyn and Partners in Belgium.

<br /><br />There are lots of good examples for round arch constructions in modern architecture.
<br />Check out Alameda subway station in Valencia by Santiago Calatrava for that. Fosters Faculty of Law in Cambridge is a nice example for a modern arch construction as well. And then there´s an awesome industrial building by Samyn and Partners in Belgium.

<br /><br />There are lots of good examples for round arch constructions in modern architecture.
<br />Check out Alameda subway station in Valencia by Santiago Calatrava for that. Fosters Faculty of Law in Cambridge is a nice example for a modern arch construction as well. And then there´s an awesome industrial building by Samyn and Partners in Belgium.

<br /><br />There are lots of good examples for round arch constructions in modern architecture.
<br />Check out Alameda subway station in Valencia by Santiago Calatrava for that. Fosters Faculty of Law in Cambridge is a nice example for a modern arch construction as well. And then there´s an awesome industrial building by Samyn and Partners in Belgium.

<br /><br />There are lots of good examples for round arch constructions in modern architecture.
<br />Check out Alameda subway station in Valencia by Santiago Calatrava for that. Fosters Faculty of Law in Cambridge is a nice example for a modern arch construction as well. And then there´s an awesome industrial building by Samyn and Partners in Belgium.

<br /><br />There are lots of good examples for round arch constructions in modern architecture.
<br />Check out Alameda subway station in Valencia by Santiago Calatrava for that. Fosters Faculty of Law in Cambridge is a nice example for a modern arch construction as well. And then there´s an awesome industrial building by Samyn and Partners in Belgium.

<br /><br />There are lots of good examples for round arch constructions in modern architecture.
<br />Check out Alameda subway station in Valencia by Santiago Calatrava for that. Fosters Faculty of Law in Cambridge is a nice example for a modern arch construction as well. And then there´s an awesome industrial building by Samyn and Partners in Belgium.

yeah, maybe you could wear them down even more, remove some parts/panels of the textures exposing cables/machinery behind them, go a bit deeper into the wall these panels are covering.&#13;

You've got some realy nice base models/textures to play around with and I think this whole theme you're working on could be developed alot further with some experimentation.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?p=160978#160978" target="_blank" class="postlink">Tutorial; Baking Multiple Maps in 3dsmax8. </a></span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

Yes. I usually do that but sometimes the results are not clearly visible in Doom. I'll work on that.&#13;

have you thought about baking a mask for behind the panel? Im not sure what app you're using for projection but if you can assign different colours to the high poly model you could bake some masks which could then be selected in photoshop.&#13;
<br/><br/>
What apps are you using?, have you looked into ambient occlusion?<br/>_________________<br/><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?p=160978#160978" target="_blank" class="postlink">Tutorial; Baking Multiple Maps in 3dsmax8. </a></span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

I use Maya and Photoshop for my work. &#13;

It has some nice features for texture baking. I'm still trying to figure out how to get the best results. The rest will be painted with a tablet usually.<br/>_________________<br/>Where is the life we have lost in living?&#13;

yeah, maybe you could wear them down even more, remove some parts/panels of the textures exposing cables/machinery behind them, go a bit deeper into the wall these panels are covering.&#13;

have you thought about baking a mask for behind the panel? Im not sure what app you're using for projection but if you can assign different colours to the high poly model you could bake some masks which could then be selected in photoshop.&#13;

What apps are you using?, have you looked into ambient occlusion?<br/>_________________<br/><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?p=160978#160978" target="_blank" class="postlink">Tutorial; Baking Multiple Maps in 3dsmax8. </a></span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

yeah, maybe you could wear them down even more, remove some parts/panels of the textures exposing cables/machinery behind them, go a bit deeper into the wall these panels are covering.&#13;

You've got some realy nice base models/textures to play around with and I think this whole theme you're working on could be developed alot further with some experimentation.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?p=160978#160978" target="_blank" class="postlink">Tutorial; Baking Multiple Maps in 3dsmax8. </a></span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

have you thought about baking a mask for behind the panel? Im not sure what app you're using for projection but if you can assign different colours to the high poly model you could bake some masks which could then be selected in photoshop.&#13;

What apps are you using?, have you looked into ambient occlusion?<br/>_________________<br/><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?p=160978#160978" target="_blank" class="postlink">Tutorial; Baking Multiple Maps in 3dsmax8. </a></span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

It has some nice features for texture baking. I'm still trying to figure out how to get the best results. The rest will be painted with a tablet usually.<br/>_________________<br/>Where is the life we have lost in living?&#13;

yeah, maybe you could wear them down even more, remove some parts/panels of the textures exposing cables/machinery behind them, go a bit deeper into the wall these panels are covering.&#13;

have you thought about baking a mask for behind the panel? Im not sure what app you're using for projection but if you can assign different colours to the high poly model you could bake some masks which could then be selected in photoshop.&#13;

What apps are you using?, have you looked into ambient occlusion?<br/>_________________<br/><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?p=160978#160978" target="_blank" class="postlink">Tutorial; Baking Multiple Maps in 3dsmax8. </a></span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

yeah, maybe you could wear them down even more, remove some parts/panels of the textures exposing cables/machinery behind them, go a bit deeper into the wall these panels are covering.&#13;

You've got some realy nice base models/textures to play around with and I think this whole theme you're working on could be developed alot further with some experimentation.<br/>_________________<br/><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?p=160978#160978" target="_blank" class="postlink">Tutorial; Baking Multiple Maps in 3dsmax8. </a></span><span class="gensmall"/></td>
