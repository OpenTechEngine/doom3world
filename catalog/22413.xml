The little bats are annoying, it´s hard enough to hit the weak spots of the boss and to run for the valves in between.<br /><br />Music is great, but sound implementation could be improved. Like a screeching sound when you turn the valves wheels, and some signal sound when the valve is closed. Also the boss could need some sounds.<br /><br />But overall really nice!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p210710" date="Posted: Sun Feb 01, 2009 11:43 pm "><author>The Happy Friar</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I thought the GUI's on the clever were a clever idea.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224124123im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />the boss looks babyish.
