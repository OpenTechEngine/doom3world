<br /><br />nope, I just put a textured cube .ase in and its like all lit up and no shadows, and the lighting in the map has no effect on it: I can't run a game of my poop mod yet, so we are talking just the editor here.

<br /><br />So got this lot, but with the dir/filename per line and still no shadows or lighting effect: do you need material...phong, blinn specified thought stone or metal might have been it
<br /><br />textures/filename
<br />{
<br />	qer_editorimage
<br />	stone
<br />	noshadows
<br />	noselfshadow
<br />	bumpmap		addnormals

<br />	specularmap

<br /><br />or is it more simple a directory path problem?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p171693" date="Posted: Tue Feb 27, 2007 1:34 pm "><author>6th Venom</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Those key words (metal, stone, flesh, etc) are for impact FX and sound impact, i think your problem here is that you point directly your tga in your model, not your material.
<br /><br />That's a common problem for starters.
<br /><br />Open your ASE with a text editor and look at the <span style="font-weight: bold">bitmap</span> value, it surely appears something like <span style="font-style: italic">"c:\doom 3\models\mapobjects\custom\skin1_d.tga"</span>, change it by <span style="font-style: italic">"\\base\models\mapobjects\custom\skin1"</span> to tell the engine what material use on it.

<br /><br />You can't put animated effect directly on a tga, or anything, like effects.
<br /><br />Materials are shaders, they allow you to make "complex" use of multiple tga images (or stages) to combine these on only one surface in the game.
<br />Plus you define how it react with light, shadows, transparencies, impact FX, sound, etc...
<br /><br />So, the game lack of infos if you point directly on a tga in your ASE/LWO/md5mesh.
