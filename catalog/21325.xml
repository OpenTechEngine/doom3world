Some of the places kinda got me lost like how did I end up their and it looked like a mixture of F.E.A.R/ Half Life2. I did like it when they kept it simple with the weirdo and drug attics, but it seems like since they added Fire Arms too the A.I more thats when I got that feel I was playing F.E.A.R. At the end of the level I guest I was going. "What???????" They where creative on the first game now it doesn't make sense at the end and it feels like Half Life 2!<br /><br />I love the new multiplayer mode! I played a couple of rounds here is what I suggest!<br /><br />1.Add a freaking skin color to the player models so I know who's on who's side? Or maybe a floating name of the user name's tag with team color? So people aren't running around like idiots trying too attack each other?<br /><br />2.More player models! Atleast add more from the game story's characters!<br /><br />3. Maybe a health that goes back to 100% after a minute wouldn't be a bad idea. A fire arm would be kick ass if it would only respawn after 5 min. Like a power up.<br /><br />Out of all that the game was very fun. It would be worth a good dollar too buy.<br /><br />If anyone needs any help with the game playing single player mode be sure to ask here or write a review of the game yourself. I will be happy too help out with any single player levels that you mite need help finishing or someone else on here will do it.<br /><br />Sorry for any errors for right now. I need too sleep and warm up left over <span style="text-decoration: underline">pizza</span>!</div>]]></body></post><post id="p204392" date="Posted: Mon Sep 01, 2008 7:20 pm "><author>Doomguy87</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Condemned 2 was fucking awesome.
