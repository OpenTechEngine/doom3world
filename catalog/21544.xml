The general idea would be to create a new entity that used a custom script object to spawn new instances of itself. The challenge is in how you keep the entity count from exceeding 4096 and how you determine where to spawn each entity.<br /><br />I'm not sure how to keep it from exceeding the entity cap unless you give each crystal a set lifetime but it's not a pressing issue that you can't revist later.<br /><br />The more challenging issue is determining where to spawn each crystal. I think the best way to do that would be to launch a projectile with a small amount of force and perform a trace to wherever it detonates. Keep in mind this projectile doesn't have to be something visible.<br /><br />Because your not using a lot of force to launch the projectile, you can be certain that it's going to hit something closeby. And you can use the information supplied by a trace to determine if it hit "worldspawn" which would be map geometry and the surface normal which would be the direction the crystal should face when growing outward.<br /><br />Keeping it isolated to a designated area might prove difficult but you may be able to stop it from spreading by using a clipping texture to catch stray projectiles.<br /><br />Then there are a lot of artistic issues to work out. How do you want to handle "growing"? Do you want them to emit green light? Each of these questions could pose new technical problems.<br /><br />Of course, keep in mind I'm just brainstorming here.
