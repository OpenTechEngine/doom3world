I haven`t started yet modeling the lava pit room they are will go into but I intend to start on that today.
<br /><br />kit89 asked if I had some wire frame versions of the images so I`ll show you guys as well. I`ve tried to keep the polys as low as possible, and this is the first time I`ve modeled rocks using quads rather then tris, which kat had recommended I use quads where ever possible, and I can see why now, although I had to convert some of them to tris to control exactly where goofos .ase exporter would make the splits.

<br /><br />Like Kat said, up the polys on the edges of the rocks to eliminate hard edges, you want to make the silhouette nice and smooth to make it look like it's got more polys than it looks.

<br /><br />and maybe because I don`t have tons of lights overlapping, but what ever the reason it looks like I will be able to increase the polycount on the parts of the map the player walks on at least <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205144035im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />interesting suggestion you made about the silhouette edges being given higher polycounts, if I understand you correctly? so combined with the bump textures should give a good impression the over all polycount is higher then it really is, yes?
<br /><br />am I correct in thinking the d3 engine is very efficient at drawing particles, like used in smoke? and is that because they usually are just alpha or additive blended and not have bumps or specular texture stages to slow them down?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157286" date="Posted: Sat Sep 16, 2006 5:15 pm "><author>Zombie13</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">r_showprimitives 1 combined with con_noprint 1 will show you whats going on in your scene.
<br /><br />Every time a light is casting on a surface that surface has to be redendered again, so imagine what something like 8 lights would do? try and keep it to about 2-4 lights (I'm pretty sure there is a section here on D3W about lightcounts etc).
<br /><br />The D3 engine really isn't that efficient at drawing particles unlike some engines where it doesn't really bother it, but in saying that, having 3-4k tris worth of particles isn't going to hinder your scene much.

<br /><br />kat, I just read your tutorial on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205144035/http://www.quake3bits.com/htm/tutorials/quake_4_editing_tips.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1146172442&amp;archive=&amp;start_from=&amp;ucat=13&amp;" class="postlink">texture space and orientation</a>
<br /><br />1. although I think I understand your tut, am I right in thinking it wouldn`t matter with rock textures and their local maps, as they would probably be acceptable in game, even if their orientation on the models and some of the local map axis were not aligned to their original up/down, left/right?
<br /><br />2. also do you have a preference over using .lwo or .ase model formats, both for the in game low poly models and the high poly local map versions?
<br /><br />3. and do all of the static model formats produce a smoothing seam where the uv maps have a seam in blender?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157349" date="Posted: Sun Sep 17, 2006 4:24 am "><author>kat</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">1 : What that tutorial/tip was really refering to was orientation of heightmap 'templates' when used to generate normalmaps. If you render out a normal map from the 1st image by then applying that verticle 'trim' to a model along the horizontal you'll create a 'flipped' channel becasue of the way the Nmap was created.
<br /><br />Rotating and moving UVWs don't make any difference in terms of 'fixing' the problem becasue it's a problem at source, on the image itself.
<br /><br />But using a 'correct' normal map has no effect when UVWmapped as the game 'compensates' for it (for want of a better term)
<br /><br />2 : I've not yet fully tested LWO models other than to solve that smoothing issue mentioned in the 'prepping LWO models tutorial'. I've got a multimaterial terrain mesh section to try out but have yet to do so.
<br /><br />3 : You mean an actual UVWmap split? A map physically broken into two sections (for example). Yes whereever there is a break in a UVWmap you get a seam in game, you can't avoid that (for terrain you can't use that tangentspace material parameter you see in character models).
<br /><br />If you're talking about Blender UVW (mark) seams then no those have no effect whatsoever one the exported model; it's basically just an 'internal' helper for Blender.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157350" date="Posted: Sun Sep 17, 2006 4:45 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">thanks kat,
<br /><br />1. understood and that`s good to hear, so I assume in blender I could even have my uv maps upside down or rotated 90 degrees on the terrain models, as long as the local map used in game as been generated using correct axis, yes?
<br /><br />2. understood and I`ll go read that tut of yours again as it was months ago I last read it.
<br /><br />3. understood and sorry, I ment a physical split where two or more meshes with different materials in blender are combined and exported as one .ase or .lwo which then produces a shadow seam in game.

<br /><br />Like Kat said, up the polys on the edges of the rocks to eliminate hard edges, you want to make the silhouette nice and smooth to make it look like it's got more polys than it looks.
<br /><br />Don't be affraid if you seen hits 100-150k tris and about 50k shadow tris, even cards like the 6600GT can handle that quite easily on high settings.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157258" date="Posted: Sat Sep 16, 2006 11:40 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">thanks zombie13, and so far I haven`t noticed any slow down with the models I`ve been adding to this map, although I`ve only been testing it with com_showfps, but I will start taking note of the tris if someone can remind me what the cvar to display them is?
<br /><br />and maybe because I don`t have tons of lights overlapping, but what ever the reason it looks like I will be able to increase the polycount on the parts of the map the player walks on at least <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205150051im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />interesting suggestion you made about the silhouette edges being given higher polycounts, if I understand you correctly? so combined with the bump textures should give a good impression the over all polycount is higher then it really is, yes?
<br /><br />am I correct in thinking the d3 engine is very efficient at drawing particles, like used in smoke? and is that because they usually are just alpha or additive blended and not have bumps or specular texture stages to slow them down?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157286" date="Posted: Sat Sep 16, 2006 5:15 pm "><author>Zombie13</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">r_showprimitives 1 combined with con_noprint 1 will show you whats going on in your scene.
<br /><br />Every time a light is casting on a surface that surface has to be redendered again, so imagine what something like 8 lights would do? try and keep it to about 2-4 lights (I'm pretty sure there is a section here on D3W about lightcounts etc).
<br /><br />The D3 engine really isn't that efficient at drawing particles unlike some engines where it doesn't really bother it, but in saying that, having 3-4k tris worth of particles isn't going to hinder your scene much.
<br /><br />Yup having higher poly silhouette edges does make for nicer rock/terrain what ever.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157314" date="Posted: Sat Sep 16, 2006 7:28 pm "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">understood and thanks for your help zombie13 <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205150051im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p157347" date="Posted: Sun Sep 17, 2006 3:53 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">not sure where to ask these questions so I`ll post them in here.

<br /><br />1. although I think I understand your tut, am I right in thinking it wouldn`t matter with rock textures and their local maps, as they would probably be acceptable in game, even if their orientation on the models and some of the local map axis were not aligned to their original up/down, left/right?
<br /><br />2. also do you have a preference over using .lwo or .ase model formats, both for the in game low poly models and the high poly local map versions?
<br /><br />3. and do all of the static model formats produce a smoothing seam where the uv maps have a seam in blender?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157349" date="Posted: Sun Sep 17, 2006 4:24 am "><author>kat</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">1 : What that tutorial/tip was really refering to was orientation of heightmap 'templates' when used to generate normalmaps. If you render out a normal map from the 1st image by then applying that verticle 'trim' to a model along the horizontal you'll create a 'flipped' channel becasue of the way the Nmap was created.
<br /><br />Rotating and moving UVWs don't make any difference in terms of 'fixing' the problem becasue it's a problem at source, on the image itself.
<br /><br />But using a 'correct' normal map has no effect when UVWmapped as the game 'compensates' for it (for want of a better term)
<br /><br />2 : I've not yet fully tested LWO models other than to solve that smoothing issue mentioned in the 'prepping LWO models tutorial'. I've got a multimaterial terrain mesh section to try out but have yet to do so.
<br /><br />3 : You mean an actual UVWmap split? A map physically broken into two sections (for example). Yes whereever there is a break in a UVWmap you get a seam in game, you can't avoid that (for terrain you can't use that tangentspace material parameter you see in character models).
<br /><br />If you're talking about Blender UVW (mark) seams then no those have no effect whatsoever one the exported model; it's basically just an 'internal' helper for Blender.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157350" date="Posted: Sun Sep 17, 2006 4:45 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">thanks kat,
<br /><br />1. understood and that`s good to hear, so I assume in blender I could even have my uv maps upside down or rotated 90 degrees on the terrain models, as long as the local map used in game as been generated using correct axis, yes?
<br /><br />2. understood and I`ll go read that tut of yours again as it was months ago I last read it.
<br /><br />3. understood and sorry, I ment a physical split where two or more meshes with different materials in blender are combined and exported as one .ase or .lwo which then produces a shadow seam in game.

The mix node as you have it setup is just averaging the color between the two images. Changing the factor to something other than .50 would make it a weighted average.

I haven`t started yet modeling the lava pit room they are will go into but I intend to start on that today.
<br /><br />kit89 asked if I had some wire frame versions of the images so I`ll show you guys as well. I`ve tried to keep the polys as low as possible, and this is the first time I`ve modeled rocks using quads rather then tris, which kat had recommended I use quads where ever possible, and I can see why now, although I had to convert some of them to tris to control exactly where goofos .ase exporter would make the splits.

<br /><br />Like Kat said, up the polys on the edges of the rocks to eliminate hard edges, you want to make the silhouette nice and smooth to make it look like it's got more polys than it looks.
<br /><br />Don't be affraid if you seen hits 100-150k tris and about 50k shadow tris, even cards like the 6600GT can handle that quite easily on high settings.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157258" date="Posted: Sat Sep 16, 2006 11:40 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">thanks zombie13, and so far I haven`t noticed any slow down with the models I`ve been adding to this map, although I`ve only been testing it with com_showfps, but I will start taking note of the tris if someone can remind me what the cvar to display them is?
<br /><br />and maybe because I don`t have tons of lights overlapping, but what ever the reason it looks like I will be able to increase the polycount on the parts of the map the player walks on at least <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205150051im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />interesting suggestion you made about the silhouette edges being given higher polycounts, if I understand you correctly? so combined with the bump textures should give a good impression the over all polycount is higher then it really is, yes?
<br /><br />am I correct in thinking the d3 engine is very efficient at drawing particles, like used in smoke? and is that because they usually are just alpha or additive blended and not have bumps or specular texture stages to slow them down?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157286" date="Posted: Sat Sep 16, 2006 5:15 pm "><author>Zombie13</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">r_showprimitives 1 combined with con_noprint 1 will show you whats going on in your scene.
<br /><br />Every time a light is casting on a surface that surface has to be redendered again, so imagine what something like 8 lights would do? try and keep it to about 2-4 lights (I'm pretty sure there is a section here on D3W about lightcounts etc).
<br /><br />The D3 engine really isn't that efficient at drawing particles unlike some engines where it doesn't really bother it, but in saying that, having 3-4k tris worth of particles isn't going to hinder your scene much.
<br /><br />Yup having higher poly silhouette edges does make for nicer rock/terrain what ever.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157314" date="Posted: Sat Sep 16, 2006 7:28 pm "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">understood and thanks for your help zombie13 <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205150051im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p157347" date="Posted: Sun Sep 17, 2006 3:53 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">not sure where to ask these questions so I`ll post them in here.

<br /><br />1. although I think I understand your tut, am I right in thinking it wouldn`t matter with rock textures and their local maps, as they would probably be acceptable in game, even if their orientation on the models and some of the local map axis were not aligned to their original up/down, left/right?
<br /><br />2. also do you have a preference over using .lwo or .ase model formats, both for the in game low poly models and the high poly local map versions?
<br /><br />3. and do all of the static model formats produce a smoothing seam where the uv maps have a seam in blender?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157349" date="Posted: Sun Sep 17, 2006 4:24 am "><author>kat</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">1 : What that tutorial/tip was really refering to was orientation of heightmap 'templates' when used to generate normalmaps. If you render out a normal map from the 1st image by then applying that verticle 'trim' to a model along the horizontal you'll create a 'flipped' channel becasue of the way the Nmap was created.
<br /><br />Rotating and moving UVWs don't make any difference in terms of 'fixing' the problem becasue it's a problem at source, on the image itself.
<br /><br />But using a 'correct' normal map has no effect when UVWmapped as the game 'compensates' for it (for want of a better term)
<br /><br />2 : I've not yet fully tested LWO models other than to solve that smoothing issue mentioned in the 'prepping LWO models tutorial'. I've got a multimaterial terrain mesh section to try out but have yet to do so.
<br /><br />3 : You mean an actual UVWmap split? A map physically broken into two sections (for example). Yes whereever there is a break in a UVWmap you get a seam in game, you can't avoid that (for terrain you can't use that tangentspace material parameter you see in character models).
<br /><br />If you're talking about Blender UVW (mark) seams then no those have no effect whatsoever one the exported model; it's basically just an 'internal' helper for Blender.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157350" date="Posted: Sun Sep 17, 2006 4:45 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">thanks kat,
<br /><br />1. understood and that`s good to hear, so I assume in blender I could even have my uv maps upside down or rotated 90 degrees on the terrain models, as long as the local map used in game as been generated using correct axis, yes?
<br /><br />2. understood and I`ll go read that tut of yours again as it was months ago I last read it.
<br /><br />3. understood and sorry, I ment a physical split where two or more meshes with different materials in blender are combined and exported as one .ase or .lwo which then produces a shadow seam in game.

The mix node as you have it setup is just averaging the color between the two images. Changing the factor to something other than .50 would make it a weighted average.

I've just added a makealpha stage to the blendlights material shaders so there is a subtle light caustics effect on the walls of the lava pit. it doesn't really show up in the static shots but when I have more of this area done I'll try and record a fraps vid to show you guys.<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130507232324/http://i104.photobucket.com/albums/m177/ratty_redemption/image654.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130507232324im_/http://s104.photobucket.com/albums/m177/ratty_redemption/th_image654.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br /><br />I've also manually tweaked the uv's of the lava to get it to flow along its path.<br /><br />that took some time to figure how to do this in blender but should in future be relatively easy for me to do with other lava flows in this hell map, I also distorted some of the lava uv's to add fluctuations when its animated, so it looks more like a liquid and less like a scrolling texture imo.<br /><br />I'm especially pleased with how it appears to speed up on the steeper slopes of the lava pit <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130507232324im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p208097" date="Posted: Fri Dec 05, 2008 7:13 pm "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">hi guys, I'm back <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130507232324im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br />a few months ago I moved cities to live again near my parents and friends in bath, england. the flat I intended to move into has only recently been fitted with broadband and I'm currently without a pc of my own, so have been working on my brother's pc when I get a chance. my progress has been slower then I would of liked but I haven't given up on this project.<br /><br />here's some shots of one of the models I've been working on over the last couple of months.<br /><br />a lot of experimentation went into these paving stones, both in modeling the meshes and the uv mapping. finally I'm satisfied with the results and my workflow.

2048x2048 normal map with lot of "details: bumps") and you add it to your own texture local map. This allows a very hi quallity texture that it's very noticiable and kills the famous "blurred" texture. This was very used with the Alpha labs zero from Sixth_Venom, but you can optimize it a lot by using only this detail map and a medium size local map.<br />This have a great pro: It will take less resources than using lots of very high res local maps<br /><br />textures/xxx/xxx<br />{<br />     	diffusemap	textures/xxx/xxx_d.tga<br />	bumpmap	             addnormals(textures/detail_map.tga, textures/xxx/xxx_local.tga)<br />	specularmap	textures/xxx/xxx_s.tga<br />}<br /><br /><br />The results are very good sometimes and may improve the quallity:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131009042339/http://img25.imageshack.us/img25/7633/detailsn.jpg">http://img25.imageshack.us/img25/7633/detailsn.jpg</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Etqw/Wolfenstein, for example use something better than this thing i posted, because they have upgraded the engine.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p219216" date="Posted: Sun Oct 04, 2009 5:33 pm "><author>phantazm11</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Looking really good, ratty.

ATM it looks as though the rockface is made of a jumble of smaller rocks (which is cool if that is what you were intending).

<br /><br />If the engine can't see a model but it's still within a portal 'block' it's my understanding that it will at least be pulled into memory (although it might not physically be rendered to screen). Having said that you *do* want to be breaking models into smaller sections anyway where possible but you have to do that based on 'VIS' i.e. what you can see when standing in one portal block looking towards another.
<br /><br />The downside to this is 'smoothgroup' edges, hard lines that run along a mesh split/join. So yes, basically break the model up so that it fits more or less into the portal blocks.
<br /><br />Having said all that though, the real killer is what zombie said above about lights and surface rendering; don't go above 4 ('area' lights - lights that illuminate large areas of the map) if you can help it.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157383" date="Posted: Sun Sep 17, 2006 2:09 pm "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">thanks kat, and after reading your post a couple of times I think I understand all of that.
<br /><br />I read earlier that visportals will split brushes into more polys along the edges of the visportals, does that also apply to models? and if so should we ideally model the edges of our split models to be straight lines where we plan on putting visportals in the map editors?
<br /><br />regarding the r_showlightcount results, so far I have a couple of rows of the large polys on the cave walls that are blue, the rest of the polys are either red or green. and the reason I ended up with the dark blue ones was I wanted a transition between the lava glow light and the blue and orange sky lights, is that ok lightcount wise?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157384" date="Posted: Sun Sep 17, 2006 2:26 pm "><author>kat</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Models are pretty much handled the same way they were with Q3, so if any part of it can be seen the whole hting will be (object) rendered, D3/Q4 et-al are the same.
<br /><br />How you split the model will depend on what the thing looks like, stright lines make things obvious, but at the same time if sections overlap portal blocks it'll render what it can see; cutting models up in more 'art' than 'science'; you'll have to go with the best result you can given what you've got.
<br /><br />Buildings are easy to do with all this stuff becasue they have straight walls everywhere, introduce a few bends and wonkey surfaces and your optimisation problems explode.
<br /><br />If you've got Kat's Basket (katq4dm2), run up to the top of the map and look down into the 'atrium' with lightcount on, note what you see in relation to performance in Q4. That's top end of the spectrum in terms of performace vs polycount/lightcount which you don't want to go over, unless it's a relatively big area like it is in that Q4 map I did.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157385" date="Posted: Sun Sep 17, 2006 2:42 pm "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">thanks again kat, this really is helping me <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131007085156im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />I currently don`t have a system that runs q4 but my bro is upgrading and passing on a system to me that will, hopefully in a couple of weeks, although we`ve been talking about it for months, but as soon as I get that system I`ll be installing q4, and hopefully prey, and then I`ll test out your maps.
<br /><br />one thing I`m surprised at with the official d3 hell maps is the amount of small overlapping lights they use, as opposed to a few large sky lights.
<br /><br />do you think they weren`t aware they could do this with those maps? as I notice in some of the other official maps, where they have outdoor sections, like with the tram rides, then they have used sky lights like we are using.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157406" date="Posted: Sun Sep 17, 2006 9:33 pm "><author>Black Dog</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">if any part of it can be seen the whole hting will be (object) rendered, D3/Q4 et-al are the same.</div>
<br /><br />You can easily change this by adding the keyval "inline 1", and then the model geometry should be surfaced and split by the compiler as if it were ordinary world geometry. 
<br /><br />This is not always going to be a clear performance win, since multiple surfaces are going to batch separately (and there will be geometry introduced by splits). However, it might be useful to have the compiler split up something which is contiguous but requires vis culling, say a large seamless cavern model, rather than having to do it yourself. Also, the compiler may make more vis-friendly splits.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157410" date="Posted: Sun Sep 17, 2006 10:46 pm "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">thanks black dog, and although I had heard of that entity keyword, I didn`t understand what we could use it for.

<br /><br />By memory, "inline" "1" turn your model into brush, but remove the collision... so you got to make "clip" brushes every where, and for complex surfaces, it's very hard to make manually somtimes.

I'm not sure if you're worried about it though. I doubt 3 extra nodes are going to kill performance.<br /><br />The math is actually really simple. The mix node as you have it setup is just averaging the color between the two images. Changing the factor to something other than .50 would make it a weighted average. The color ramp node is just remapping the input to a different range.

<br /><br />although I ended up doing quite a lot of tweaking to the mesh, what was really time consuming was the uv map, or uvw as kat calls them.
<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131007085207/http://img215.imageshack.us/my.php?image=image423yk4.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131007085207im_/http://img215.imageshack.us/img215/9100/image423yk4.th.jpg" alt="Image" /></a>
<br /><br />until I got the mesh exactly how I wanted, I realize now I should of tested the model with simple planar texture projections done in blender (uv calculation panel\from window button) which takes only moments to set up, although we don`t have much control of the results and they can come out looking stretched on certain faces not aligned with the projection angle.
<br /><br />then when the model was "finished" that would of been the time to use blender`s "live lscm" mapping, as seen in the image above, which in my opinion gives the best quality.
<br /><br />the tricky part with a model like this is first setting up the texture seams, shown here with the light blue lines, then dragging the little red dots around to get the best scale and alignment and least texture distortion, which took me hours in this case. although the previous rounder shaped rock were easy in comparison as their uv maps looked radial in general as opposed to elongated.
<br /><br />anyway, I will make faster progress with this now and have nearly finished the other sections of the rock bridge, which I`ll ul in game images of asap.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157786" date="Posted: Fri Sep 22, 2006 3:58 pm "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I forgot to mention that I`m building this bridge with a few more polys then the previous rocks, so some of you might be able to make out the beveling on the bridge`s crack to the right of it`s center.

If you are still spending ages trying to tweak uvs by hand after running an lcsm, then you probably need to choose seams either more carefully or more aggressively.
<br /><br />When doing rocks I personally prefer to work by placing seams and unwrapping, without any pinning or manual moving whatsoever (apart from moving/scaling/rotating the entire uvset). If the mapping is bad, I place better seams and unwrap again. Herding uvs around your mesh is basically a huge pain in the ass, and it's really best to let the tools handle that for you.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157800" date="Posted: Fri Sep 22, 2006 6:53 pm "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">thanks blackdog, and maybe I could of placed the seams in better locations but I was trying to keep them so the player couldn`t see them if possible, which also ment me not using as many seams as I would otherwise.
<br /><br />also with the bump mapping I`m using on these rocks being large, it`s often very noticeable when a seam splits a rock surface, as the bumps don`t align along the seam edges. hmmm, thinking about that, if I placed the seams across the dirt parts of the model, then they might not be as noticeable as the rock ones, due to dirt having a much finer local and height map for the bumps.
<br /><br />the problem I was getting with the unpinned lscm results were uv`s overlapping or creating pixel thin mapping which ment the textures got very stretched on my mesh work.
<br /><br />thankfully the live lscm does save time by moving the unpinned uv`s around to compensate for the pinned uv`s being edited by us, but as I haven`t really used it before, it`s taken a few days to learn how to use it. in future I`ll be quicker at using live lscm.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157803" date="Posted: Fri Sep 22, 2006 8:00 pm "><author>Black Dog</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">the problem I was getting with the unpinned lscm results were uv`s overlapping or creating pixel thin mapping which ment the textures got very stretched on my mesh work.</div>
<br /><br />That's because you don't have seams in the right places to get a low distortion mapping. With seaming around the sides like that you basically have a refined planar mapping at the moment, and that's pretty restrictive.
<br /><br />Looking at that model, it should be fairly easy to find a layout that would minimise stretching without having any seams on the top of the model. I'll mock up a similar model and show you what I mean.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157806" date="Posted: Fri Sep 22, 2006 8:05 pm "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">understood and thanks a lot. and if you have blender, I can ul that model`s .blend file or export it to a couple of over formats which your modeling app might be able to use.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157807" date="Posted: Fri Sep 22, 2006 8:06 pm "><author>obihb</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I actaully think for that mesh from your previous screenshot, you can get even less seaming in there. If you think about it like unwrapping a character, or maybe the limb of a character, you'll see that you can have fewer seams and just about perfectly hidden seams.
<br /><br />I don't really know the capabilities of Blender's UV tools but even without special tools to help align verticies, you can get a pretty decent layout in a fairly short time there. I assume that Blender has a similar function that Max does which is called Relax. This pretty much will try and align the verts for you to try and minimise stretching in the UV. With a tool like this you can get really good UV in just about no time.
<br /><br />So, what I mean with less seams n this case is that you can have the seam running down the bottom in the middle of the mesh. This way you'll have a nice seamless texture going all the way around the edge of the rock. Even if you have a bit of stretching on the UV to make that happen, most of the times the stretching is preferred there above seams. Maybe that's a bit of personal choice but I do think that seams are much uglier than a bit of stretch to get rid of them. But then of course the stretch has it's limits aswell before going into seams is better.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157810" date="Posted: Fri Sep 22, 2006 8:35 pm "><author>Black Dog</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131007085207/http://members.westnet.com.au/GeoffGole/temp/unwrapping_rockwork_with_seams.png" class="postlink">Example 1</a>

<br /><br />These are not great examples, but you can see what ohihb is talking about. There's a little stretching on the corner there (could easily get rid of that with some care, this is just an example), but no visible seams. The whole thing is one uv island, and you could easily get more aggresive with slicing up things in order to kill the stretching.
<br /><br />I took a few minutes to place the seams, unwrapping itself wouldn't have been more than ten seconds.

<br /><br />So whats your idea for the e-card?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p169712" date="Posted: Tue Feb 06, 2007 12:20 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">thanks kit89, and I'm determined to release some thing playable from my hell map project this year, as I've spent the last few years  just building models or doing test maps, but nothing actually playable.
<br /><br />ot: the e-card concept my girl friend and I came up with was a large terrain model built and animated in blender, with a camera flight hugging the ground and with movement similar to a helicopter, ie being able to fly forward but aim the camera in other directions. then when the camera reaches a certain mountain, it orbits around it and bump mapped writing is revealed on one side of the mountain.
<br /><br />it sounded straight forward but I've had several technical hurdles to over come, and I built the terrain all by hand which took a lot longer then I predicted it would, plus the new material node system in blender doesn't seem to like displacement maps, as opposed to normal maps, so again I had to add in a lot of detail by hand rather then use bump mapping, although I could use some for small details.
<br /><br />with the new sculpt and retopo tools being included with the next major release of blender, it looks like terrain modeling will be a lot quicker to work with then manually subdividing and dragging verts around a mesh.
<br /><br />so in a way, the timing of me getting back to the hell map should coincide well with blenders next release.
<br /><br />I'm also going to release the terrain mesh from the e-card to the quake and doom communities, in case anyone wants to use the model in their projects. this is partly as I would like to see it in game but don't have the time to spend on it, and it's a different scale and style to the hell terrain I've been building.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p169764" date="Posted: Tue Feb 06, 2007 2:02 pm "><author>kit89</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">For the e-card have you tried using a camera parented to a path? with the camera pointing to an Empty to allow for easier movements?

<br /><br />There's a tutorial right at the top named "Cars Animation Tutorial.pdf " which goes into fair detail on how to get the most out of path animation. It may be using cars but the features &amp; abilities shown can be implemented to anything.

<br /><br />I've done a little work on my hell map over the last week, modeling some chains which are going to suspend the various cages over the lava pit, and some of the chains the player will be able to walk along to get to secrets in the map.
<br /><br />but I mainly worked on a new blender e-card for valentines day. this e-card animation went really well and I tried several things in blender which I had only previously read about or seen in tutorials.
<br /><br />I definitely have more skills and knowledge now then when I was previously working on the hell map last year, and with blender's new retopo and sculpt tools, which I'm currently experimenting with, the hell map should make good progress over the next few months <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131007085207im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />sorry I don't have any screen shots yet, but I should do over the next week if all goes well.
<br /><br />its also such a cool feeling to see my work inside a game engine again, as the last few months I've just been working on blender animations, and sadly they didn't involve blasting any imps or hell knights with shotguns which I've also missed doing <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131007085207im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil" /><br /><br />that's the main downside of living with my girlfriend, between doing my share of the house keeping and spending time with her, which I do enjoy doing but it leaves less time for me to work compared to when I lived on my own, and I've not found time to do any gaming since I moved in here <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20131007085207im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><br /><br />saying that I wouldn't go back to my old life given the choice, and we're very much in love but its taking some adjusting and I'm having to learn to manage my time better.
<br /><br />anyway back on topic, I'm planning on releasing an alpha version of the map once the first area is done, so you guys can test it and give me some feedback on the single player gameplay, also if any skilled mappers or modelers are interested in turning my single player content into a mp map for either d3 or q4, the latter just using my custom content of course, then either post in here or pm me.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p170992" date="Posted: Mon Feb 19, 2007 3:42 pm "><author>Bo$bevok</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">hey ratty,

<br /><br />I've been very busy this last month working on my port folio and forming a new team intending to work with the blender game engine. unfortunately this has meant I've hardly worked directly on the d3 hell map project.
<br /><br />but as I've been spending a lot of time learning the new material node system in blender, a byproduct of that work is I've nearly finished some organic procedural textures I can use in the d3 hell map. I'll try and show you guys some screen shots as soon as they have been converted to bitmaps and tested in game.
<br /><br />I also have been practicing animating with bones in blender, and one of my blender abstract animations has tentacles so combined with the new textures it could make some interesting map objects, perhaps even a monster.

The mix node as you have it setup is just averaging the color between the two images. Changing the factor to something other than .50 would make it a weighted average. The color ramp node is just remapping the input to a different range. It's like doing a levels adjustment in Photoshop.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p220716" date="Posted: Mon Nov 30, 2009 6:40 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">rich, thanks and understood, I'll try that tomorrow. in the mean time this is my latest test.

<br /><br />I've been very busy this last month working on my port folio and forming a new team intending to work with the blender game engine. unfortunately this has meant I've hardly worked directly on the d3 hell map project.
<br /><br />but as I've been spending a lot of time learning the new material node system in blender, a byproduct of that work is I've nearly finished some organic procedural textures I can use in the d3 hell map. I'll try and show you guys some screen shots as soon as they have been converted to bitmaps and tested in game.
<br /><br />I also have been practicing animating with bones in blender, and one of my blender abstract animations has tentacles so combined with the new textures it could make some interesting map objects, perhaps even a monster.
<br /><br />anyway, despite the slow progress on this d3 project, I have no intention of giving up, especially as I also plan it to go towards my port folio.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p192487" date="Posted: Thu Dec 13, 2007 4:52 am "><author>chuckdood</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">how's this project coming?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p192488" date="Posted: Thu Dec 13, 2007 5:07 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">unfortunately its been on hold for most of the last year since I moved but I'm planning on picking it up again soon. although I have less spare time then I used to, I've mainly be improving my skills in blender, and learning to make normal maps.<br /><br />I have also been planning a 2nd area of the hell map, which will include a castle. the castle itself will be modeled in blender but I might model the terrain in earth sculptor, which gorker from the sd qw forums has been teaching us about, as I help him and some of the other guys there learn blender.<br /><br />if possible I will also use the castle for a qw map, but since I don't have a system capable of running qw yet, I won't be able to test the gameplay, so might ask gorker or someone else there to work on the mapping side.<br /><br />I know it looks like I gave up on this hell map project but I have no intention of doing so, and doubt I will move on from d3 until d4 comes out if it ever does.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p198927" date="Posted: Tue May 13, 2008 12:27 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I just posted this over at katsbits forums because its blender 3d related, but I'll post in here as well <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205150353im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">here is the first publicly released shot of my d3 hell map rebuild, currently just a very low poly (3,350) cave and tunnel system, poly modeled in blender.<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205150353/http://i104.photobucket.com/albums/m177/ratty_redemption/image623.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081205150353im_/http://s104.photobucket.com/albums/m177/ratty_redemption/th_image623.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br /><br />if you can see them, the little green oblongs are iirc the dimensions of the d3 player model, ie 32x32x74 units. so hopefully this will give some sense of scale.<br /><br />I have several more tunnels and large caves planned which I'll show as I progress, but next on my to do list is start adding steps to the steeper tunnels. some of the others will eventually have lifts and ladders.<br /><br />I understand by todays pc specs I could probably increase the poly count of the caves and tunnels but I'll do that as I detail each area, for now this stage is mainly about me getting all the main areas built and connected.<br /><br />the texturing and lighting is lower down on my to do list.

<br /><br />kit89 asked if I had some wire frame versions of the images so I`ll show you guys as well. I`ve tried to keep the polys as low as possible, and this is the first time I`ve modeled rocks using quads rather then tris, which kat had recommended I use quads where ever possible, and I can see why now, although I had to convert some of them to tris to control exactly where goofos .ase exporter would make the splits.
<br /><br />oh and I registered an account with photobucket.com yesterday but then their site went into some maintenance time, so I couldn`t link to the pics I was going to ul on there, in the mean time we`ll have to do without thumb images.

<br /><br />encouraging to hear you think I can increase the polycount on these rocks, which I would love to do if I can get away with it. I actually tried to keep about the same poly count as the originals, which I agree do look very angular in places.

<br /><br />Like Kat said, up the polys on the edges of the rocks to eliminate hard edges, you want to make the silhouette nice and smooth to make it look like it's got more polys than it looks.

<br /><br />and maybe because I don`t have tons of lights overlapping, but what ever the reason it looks like I will be able to increase the polycount on the parts of the map the player walks on at least <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080210193003im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />interesting suggestion you made about the silhouette edges being given higher polycounts, if I understand you correctly? so combined with the bump textures should give a good impression the over all polycount is higher then it really is, yes?
<br /><br />am I correct in thinking the d3 engine is very efficient at drawing particles, like used in smoke? and is that because they usually are just alpha or additive blended and not have bumps or specular texture stages to slow them down?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157286" date="Posted: Sat Sep 16, 2006 5:15 pm "><author>Zombie13</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">r_showprimitives 1 combined with con_noprint 1 will show you whats going on in your scene.

<br /><br />kat, I just read your tutorial on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080210193003/http://www.quake3bits.com/htm/tutorials/quake_4_editing_tips.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1146172442&amp;archive=&amp;start_from=&amp;ucat=13&amp;" class="postlink">texture space and orientation</a>
<br /><br />1. although I think I understand your tut, am I right in thinking it wouldn`t matter with rock textures and their local maps, as they would probably be acceptable in game, even if their orientation on the models and some of the local map axis were not aligned to their original up/down, left/right?
<br /><br />2. also do you have a preference over using .lwo or .ase model formats, both for the in game low poly models and the high poly local map versions?
<br /><br />3. and do all of the static model formats produce a smoothing seam where the uv maps have a seam in blender?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157349" date="Posted: Sun Sep 17, 2006 4:24 am "><author>kat</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">1 : What that tutorial/tip was really refering to was orientation of heightmap 'templates' when used to generate normalmaps. If you render out a normal map from the 1st image by then applying that verticle 'trim' to a model along the horizontal you'll create a 'flipped' channel becasue of the way the Nmap was created.
<br /><br />Rotating and moving UVWs don't make any difference in terms of 'fixing' the problem becasue it's a problem at source, on the image itself.
<br /><br />But using a 'correct' normal map has no effect when UVWmapped as the game 'compensates' for it (for want of a better term)
<br /><br />2 : I've not yet fully tested LWO models other than to solve that smoothing issue mentioned in the 'prepping LWO models tutorial'. I've got a multimaterial terrain mesh section to try out but have yet to do so.
<br /><br />3 : You mean an actual UVWmap split? A map physically broken into two sections (for example). Yes whereever there is a break in a UVWmap you get a seam in game, you can't avoid that (for terrain you can't use that tangentspace material parameter you see in character models).
<br /><br />If you're talking about Blender UVW (mark) seams then no those have no effect whatsoever one the exported model; it's basically just an 'internal' helper for Blender.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157350" date="Posted: Sun Sep 17, 2006 4:45 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">thanks kat,
<br /><br />1. understood and that`s good to hear, so I assume in blender I could even have my uv maps upside down or rotated 90 degrees on the terrain models, as long as the local map used in game as been generated using correct axis, yes?
<br /><br />2. understood and I`ll go read that tut of yours again as it was months ago I last read it.
<br /><br />3. understood and sorry, I ment a physical split where two or more meshes with different materials in blender are combined and exported as one .ase or .lwo which then produces a shadow seam in game.

I haven`t started yet modeling the lava pit room they are will go into but I intend to start on that today.
<br /><br />kit89 asked if I had some wire frame versions of the images so I`ll show you guys as well. I`ve tried to keep the polys as low as possible, and this is the first time I`ve modeled rocks using quads rather then tris, which kat had recommended I use quads where ever possible, and I can see why now, although I had to convert some of them to tris to control exactly where goofos .ase exporter would make the splits.
<br /><br />oh and I registered an account with photobucket.com yesterday but then their site went into some maintenance time, so I couldn`t link to the pics I was going to ul on there, in the mean time we`ll have to do without thumb images.

<br /><br />encouraging to hear you think I can increase the polycount on these rocks, which I would love to do if I can get away with it. I actually tried to keep about the same poly count as the originals, which I agree do look very angular in places.
<br /><br />saying all that, I think I`ll finish a basic layout of the first area or room that these are going into, then if the sp monsters and particles aren`t slowing the fps down too much I can add more polys <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p156981" date="Posted: Thu Sep 14, 2006 2:22 am "><author>kat</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Ohhh if they're part of a larger scene then yeah you can still up the polycount a bit to get better smoothing in game but don't go crazy.

						<div class="postbody">these are the first images I`ve taken of this wip project. there of some floating (gravity defying) rocks I modeled in blender which the d3 player will traverse. I`ll ul some in game images tomorrow, if all goes well.
<br /><br />also uses one of my own rock textures, but in game I`m still using some local and height maps which came with d3, which I`ll replace with my own when I get round to modeling the local map in blender and painting the hieght map in psp7.

						<div class="postbody">thanks Zamideus, although you might be misjudging the scale, these are just rocks the player stands on and jumps between. I haven`t started yet modeling the lava pit room they are will go into but I intend to start on that today.
<br /><br />kit89 asked if I had some wire frame versions of the images so I`ll show you guys as well. I`ve tried to keep the polys as low as possible, and this is the first time I`ve modeled rocks using quads rather then tris, which kat had recommended I use quads where ever possible, and I can see why now, although I had to convert some of them to tris to control exactly where goofos .ase exporter would make the splits.
<br /><br />oh and I registered an account with photobucket.com yesterday but then their site went into some maintenance time, so I couldn`t link to the pics I was going to ul on there, in the mean time we`ll have to do without thumb images.

						<div class="postbody">Watch out for the height of those 'pathway' blocks from the ground. You'll need to drop them or raise the ground level around the edges so that the flat faces of the boxes are NO MORE THAN 8 units from any given surface otherwise you hit a wall and travel along the edge instead of up and over it (as you would normally do) becasue of the way the collisions system works. 
<br /><br />Don't be so stingy with the polycount either! Round off the sharp edges otherwise they'll look naff in game (that'll add a bit to the pCount if you do it on all the sharp/hard edges).</div>

						<div class="postbody">thanks kat, and the height of the "stepping stones" as I like to think of them, seems fine in game, as there is always a side of them which is only a few map units above the rock surface, and I`ve done lots of tests with the player walking, running and jumping on them, as well as comparing them to the ones from the original d3 hell maps, but I agree something we need to keep an eye on when placing these.
<br /><br />encouraging to hear you think I can increase the polycount on these rocks, which I would love to do if I can get away with it. I actually tried to keep about the same poly count as the originals, which I agree do look very angular in places.
<br /><br />saying all that, I think I`ll finish a basic layout of the first area or room that these are going into, then if the sp monsters and particles aren`t slowing the fps down too much I can add more polys <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>

<br /><br />Like Kat said, up the polys on the edges of the rocks to eliminate hard edges, you want to make the silhouette nice and smooth to make it look like it's got more polys than it looks.
<br /><br />Don't be affraid if you seen hits 100-150k tris and about 50k shadow tris, even cards like the 6600GT can handle that quite easily on high settings.</div>

						<div class="postbody">thanks zombie13, and so far I haven`t noticed any slow down with the models I`ve been adding to this map, although I`ve only been testing it with com_showfps, but I will start taking note of the tris if someone can remind me what the cvar to display them is?
<br /><br />and maybe because I don`t have tons of lights overlapping, but what ever the reason it looks like I will be able to increase the polycount on the parts of the map the player walks on at least <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />interesting suggestion you made about the silhouette edges being given higher polycounts, if I understand you correctly? so combined with the bump textures should give a good impression the over all polycount is higher then it really is, yes?
<br /><br />am I correct in thinking the d3 engine is very efficient at drawing particles, like used in smoke? and is that because they usually are just alpha or additive blended and not have bumps or specular texture stages to slow them down?</div>

						<div class="postbody">r_showprimitives 1 combined with con_noprint 1 will show you whats going on in your scene.
<br /><br />Every time a light is casting on a surface that surface has to be redendered again, so imagine what something like 8 lights would do? try and keep it to about 2-4 lights (I'm pretty sure there is a section here on D3W about lightcounts etc).
<br /><br />The D3 engine really isn't that efficient at drawing particles unlike some engines where it doesn't really bother it, but in saying that, having 3-4k tris worth of particles isn't going to hinder your scene much.
<br /><br />Yup having higher poly silhouette edges does make for nicer rock/terrain what ever.</div>

I haven`t started yet modeling the lava pit room they are will go into but I intend to start on that today.
<br /><br />kit89 asked if I had some wire frame versions of the images so I`ll show you guys as well. I`ve tried to keep the polys as low as possible, and this is the first time I`ve modeled rocks using quads rather then tris, which kat had recommended I use quads where ever possible, and I can see why now, although I had to convert some of them to tris to control exactly where goofos .ase exporter would make the splits.
<br /><br />oh and I registered an account with photobucket.com yesterday but then their site went into some maintenance time, so I couldn`t link to the pics I was going to ul on there, in the mean time we`ll have to do without thumb images.

<br /><br />encouraging to hear you think I can increase the polycount on these rocks, which I would love to do if I can get away with it. I actually tried to keep about the same poly count as the originals, which I agree do look very angular in places.
<br /><br />saying all that, I think I`ll finish a basic layout of the first area or room that these are going into, then if the sp monsters and particles aren`t slowing the fps down too much I can add more polys <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p156981" date="Posted: Thu Sep 14, 2006 2:22 am "><author>kat</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Ohhh if they're part of a larger scene then yeah you can still up the polycount a bit to get better smoothing in game but don't go crazy.

<br /><br />Like Kat said, up the polys on the edges of the rocks to eliminate hard edges, you want to make the silhouette nice and smooth to make it look like it's got more polys than it looks.
<br /><br />Don't be affraid if you seen hits 100-150k tris and about 50k shadow tris, even cards like the 6600GT can handle that quite easily on high settings.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157258" date="Posted: Sat Sep 16, 2006 11:40 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">thanks zombie13, and so far I haven`t noticed any slow down with the models I`ve been adding to this map, although I`ve only been testing it with com_showfps, but I will start taking note of the tris if someone can remind me what the cvar to display them is?
<br /><br />and maybe because I don`t have tons of lights overlapping, but what ever the reason it looks like I will be able to increase the polycount on the parts of the map the player walks on at least <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />interesting suggestion you made about the silhouette edges being given higher polycounts, if I understand you correctly? so combined with the bump textures should give a good impression the over all polycount is higher then it really is, yes?
<br /><br />am I correct in thinking the d3 engine is very efficient at drawing particles, like used in smoke? and is that because they usually are just alpha or additive blended and not have bumps or specular texture stages to slow them down?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157286" date="Posted: Sat Sep 16, 2006 5:15 pm "><author>Zombie13</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">r_showprimitives 1 combined with con_noprint 1 will show you whats going on in your scene.
<br /><br />Every time a light is casting on a surface that surface has to be redendered again, so imagine what something like 8 lights would do? try and keep it to about 2-4 lights (I'm pretty sure there is a section here on D3W about lightcounts etc).
<br /><br />The D3 engine really isn't that efficient at drawing particles unlike some engines where it doesn't really bother it, but in saying that, having 3-4k tris worth of particles isn't going to hinder your scene much.
<br /><br />Yup having higher poly silhouette edges does make for nicer rock/terrain what ever.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157314" date="Posted: Sat Sep 16, 2006 7:28 pm "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">understood and thanks for your help zombie13 <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p157347" date="Posted: Sun Sep 17, 2006 3:53 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">not sure where to ask these questions so I`ll post them in here.

						<div class="postbody">these are the first images I`ve taken of this wip project. there of some floating (gravity defying) rocks I modeled in blender which the d3 player will traverse. I`ll ul some in game images tomorrow, if all goes well.
<br /><br />also uses one of my own rock textures, but in game I`m still using some local and height maps which came with d3, which I`ll replace with my own when I get round to modeling the local map in blender and painting the hieght map in psp7.

						<div class="postbody">thanks Zamideus, although you might be misjudging the scale, these are just rocks the player stands on and jumps between. I haven`t started yet modeling the lava pit room they are will go into but I intend to start on that today.
<br /><br />kit89 asked if I had some wire frame versions of the images so I`ll show you guys as well. I`ve tried to keep the polys as low as possible, and this is the first time I`ve modeled rocks using quads rather then tris, which kat had recommended I use quads where ever possible, and I can see why now, although I had to convert some of them to tris to control exactly where goofos .ase exporter would make the splits.
<br /><br />oh and I registered an account with photobucket.com yesterday but then their site went into some maintenance time, so I couldn`t link to the pics I was going to ul on there, in the mean time we`ll have to do without thumb images.

						<div class="postbody">Watch out for the height of those 'pathway' blocks from the ground. You'll need to drop them or raise the ground level around the edges so that the flat faces of the boxes are NO MORE THAN 8 units from any given surface otherwise you hit a wall and travel along the edge instead of up and over it (as you would normally do) becasue of the way the collisions system works. 
<br /><br />Don't be so stingy with the polycount either! Round off the sharp edges otherwise they'll look naff in game (that'll add a bit to the pCount if you do it on all the sharp/hard edges).</div>

						<div class="postbody">thanks kat, and the height of the "stepping stones" as I like to think of them, seems fine in game, as there is always a side of them which is only a few map units above the rock surface, and I`ve done lots of tests with the player walking, running and jumping on them, as well as comparing them to the ones from the original d3 hell maps, but I agree something we need to keep an eye on when placing these.
<br /><br />encouraging to hear you think I can increase the polycount on these rocks, which I would love to do if I can get away with it. I actually tried to keep about the same poly count as the originals, which I agree do look very angular in places.
<br /><br />saying all that, I think I`ll finish a basic layout of the first area or room that these are going into, then if the sp monsters and particles aren`t slowing the fps down too much I can add more polys <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>

<br /><br />Like Kat said, up the polys on the edges of the rocks to eliminate hard edges, you want to make the silhouette nice and smooth to make it look like it's got more polys than it looks.
<br /><br />Don't be affraid if you seen hits 100-150k tris and about 50k shadow tris, even cards like the 6600GT can handle that quite easily on high settings.</div>

						<div class="postbody">thanks zombie13, and so far I haven`t noticed any slow down with the models I`ve been adding to this map, although I`ve only been testing it with com_showfps, but I will start taking note of the tris if someone can remind me what the cvar to display them is?
<br /><br />and maybe because I don`t have tons of lights overlapping, but what ever the reason it looks like I will be able to increase the polycount on the parts of the map the player walks on at least <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />interesting suggestion you made about the silhouette edges being given higher polycounts, if I understand you correctly? so combined with the bump textures should give a good impression the over all polycount is higher then it really is, yes?
<br /><br />am I correct in thinking the d3 engine is very efficient at drawing particles, like used in smoke? and is that because they usually are just alpha or additive blended and not have bumps or specular texture stages to slow them down?</div>

						<div class="postbody">r_showprimitives 1 combined with con_noprint 1 will show you whats going on in your scene.
<br /><br />Every time a light is casting on a surface that surface has to be redendered again, so imagine what something like 8 lights would do? try and keep it to about 2-4 lights (I'm pretty sure there is a section here on D3W about lightcounts etc).
<br /><br />The D3 engine really isn't that efficient at drawing particles unlike some engines where it doesn't really bother it, but in saying that, having 3-4k tris worth of particles isn't going to hinder your scene much.
<br /><br />Yup having higher poly silhouette edges does make for nicer rock/terrain what ever.</div>

I haven`t started yet modeling the lava pit room they are will go into but I intend to start on that today.
<br /><br />kit89 asked if I had some wire frame versions of the images so I`ll show you guys as well. I`ve tried to keep the polys as low as possible, and this is the first time I`ve modeled rocks using quads rather then tris, which kat had recommended I use quads where ever possible, and I can see why now, although I had to convert some of them to tris to control exactly where goofos .ase exporter would make the splits.
<br /><br />oh and I registered an account with photobucket.com yesterday but then their site went into some maintenance time, so I couldn`t link to the pics I was going to ul on there, in the mean time we`ll have to do without thumb images.

<br /><br />encouraging to hear you think I can increase the polycount on these rocks, which I would love to do if I can get away with it. I actually tried to keep about the same poly count as the originals, which I agree do look very angular in places.
<br /><br />saying all that, I think I`ll finish a basic layout of the first area or room that these are going into, then if the sp monsters and particles aren`t slowing the fps down too much I can add more polys <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p156981" date="Posted: Thu Sep 14, 2006 2:22 am "><author>kat</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Ohhh if they're part of a larger scene then yeah you can still up the polycount a bit to get better smoothing in game but don't go crazy.

<br /><br />Like Kat said, up the polys on the edges of the rocks to eliminate hard edges, you want to make the silhouette nice and smooth to make it look like it's got more polys than it looks.
<br /><br />Don't be affraid if you seen hits 100-150k tris and about 50k shadow tris, even cards like the 6600GT can handle that quite easily on high settings.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157258" date="Posted: Sat Sep 16, 2006 11:40 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">thanks zombie13, and so far I haven`t noticed any slow down with the models I`ve been adding to this map, although I`ve only been testing it with com_showfps, but I will start taking note of the tris if someone can remind me what the cvar to display them is?
<br /><br />and maybe because I don`t have tons of lights overlapping, but what ever the reason it looks like I will be able to increase the polycount on the parts of the map the player walks on at least <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />interesting suggestion you made about the silhouette edges being given higher polycounts, if I understand you correctly? so combined with the bump textures should give a good impression the over all polycount is higher then it really is, yes?
<br /><br />am I correct in thinking the d3 engine is very efficient at drawing particles, like used in smoke? and is that because they usually are just alpha or additive blended and not have bumps or specular texture stages to slow them down?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157286" date="Posted: Sat Sep 16, 2006 5:15 pm "><author>Zombie13</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">r_showprimitives 1 combined with con_noprint 1 will show you whats going on in your scene.
<br /><br />Every time a light is casting on a surface that surface has to be redendered again, so imagine what something like 8 lights would do? try and keep it to about 2-4 lights (I'm pretty sure there is a section here on D3W about lightcounts etc).
<br /><br />The D3 engine really isn't that efficient at drawing particles unlike some engines where it doesn't really bother it, but in saying that, having 3-4k tris worth of particles isn't going to hinder your scene much.
<br /><br />Yup having higher poly silhouette edges does make for nicer rock/terrain what ever.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157314" date="Posted: Sat Sep 16, 2006 7:28 pm "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">understood and thanks for your help zombie13 <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p157347" date="Posted: Sun Sep 17, 2006 3:53 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">not sure where to ask these questions so I`ll post them in here.

						<div class="postbody">these are the first images I`ve taken of this wip project. there of some floating (gravity defying) rocks I modeled in blender which the d3 player will traverse. I`ll ul some in game images tomorrow, if all goes well.
<br /><br />also uses one of my own rock textures, but in game I`m still using some local and height maps which came with d3, which I`ll replace with my own when I get round to modeling the local map in blender and painting the hieght map in psp7.

						<div class="postbody">thanks Zamideus, although you might be misjudging the scale, these are just rocks the player stands on and jumps between. I haven`t started yet modeling the lava pit room they are will go into but I intend to start on that today.
<br /><br />kit89 asked if I had some wire frame versions of the images so I`ll show you guys as well. I`ve tried to keep the polys as low as possible, and this is the first time I`ve modeled rocks using quads rather then tris, which kat had recommended I use quads where ever possible, and I can see why now, although I had to convert some of them to tris to control exactly where goofos .ase exporter would make the splits.
<br /><br />oh and I registered an account with photobucket.com yesterday but then their site went into some maintenance time, so I couldn`t link to the pics I was going to ul on there, in the mean time we`ll have to do without thumb images.

						<div class="postbody">Watch out for the height of those 'pathway' blocks from the ground. You'll need to drop them or raise the ground level around the edges so that the flat faces of the boxes are NO MORE THAN 8 units from any given surface otherwise you hit a wall and travel along the edge instead of up and over it (as you would normally do) becasue of the way the collisions system works. 
<br /><br />Don't be so stingy with the polycount either! Round off the sharp edges otherwise they'll look naff in game (that'll add a bit to the pCount if you do it on all the sharp/hard edges).</div>

						<div class="postbody">thanks kat, and the height of the "stepping stones" as I like to think of them, seems fine in game, as there is always a side of them which is only a few map units above the rock surface, and I`ve done lots of tests with the player walking, running and jumping on them, as well as comparing them to the ones from the original d3 hell maps, but I agree something we need to keep an eye on when placing these.
<br /><br />encouraging to hear you think I can increase the polycount on these rocks, which I would love to do if I can get away with it. I actually tried to keep about the same poly count as the originals, which I agree do look very angular in places.
<br /><br />saying all that, I think I`ll finish a basic layout of the first area or room that these are going into, then if the sp monsters and particles aren`t slowing the fps down too much I can add more polys <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>

<br /><br />Like Kat said, up the polys on the edges of the rocks to eliminate hard edges, you want to make the silhouette nice and smooth to make it look like it's got more polys than it looks.
<br /><br />Don't be affraid if you seen hits 100-150k tris and about 50k shadow tris, even cards like the 6600GT can handle that quite easily on high settings.</div>

						<div class="postbody">thanks zombie13, and so far I haven`t noticed any slow down with the models I`ve been adding to this map, although I`ve only been testing it with com_showfps, but I will start taking note of the tris if someone can remind me what the cvar to display them is?
<br /><br />and maybe because I don`t have tons of lights overlapping, but what ever the reason it looks like I will be able to increase the polycount on the parts of the map the player walks on at least <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />interesting suggestion you made about the silhouette edges being given higher polycounts, if I understand you correctly? so combined with the bump textures should give a good impression the over all polycount is higher then it really is, yes?
<br /><br />am I correct in thinking the d3 engine is very efficient at drawing particles, like used in smoke? and is that because they usually are just alpha or additive blended and not have bumps or specular texture stages to slow them down?</div>

						<div class="postbody">r_showprimitives 1 combined with con_noprint 1 will show you whats going on in your scene.
<br /><br />Every time a light is casting on a surface that surface has to be redendered again, so imagine what something like 8 lights would do? try and keep it to about 2-4 lights (I'm pretty sure there is a section here on D3W about lightcounts etc).
<br /><br />The D3 engine really isn't that efficient at drawing particles unlike some engines where it doesn't really bother it, but in saying that, having 3-4k tris worth of particles isn't going to hinder your scene much.
<br /><br />Yup having higher poly silhouette edges does make for nicer rock/terrain what ever.</div>

I haven`t started yet modeling the lava pit room they are will go into but I intend to start on that today.
<br /><br />kit89 asked if I had some wire frame versions of the images so I`ll show you guys as well. I`ve tried to keep the polys as low as possible, and this is the first time I`ve modeled rocks using quads rather then tris, which kat had recommended I use quads where ever possible, and I can see why now, although I had to convert some of them to tris to control exactly where goofos .ase exporter would make the splits.
<br /><br />oh and I registered an account with photobucket.com yesterday but then their site went into some maintenance time, so I couldn`t link to the pics I was going to ul on there, in the mean time we`ll have to do without thumb images.

<br /><br />encouraging to hear you think I can increase the polycount on these rocks, which I would love to do if I can get away with it. I actually tried to keep about the same poly count as the originals, which I agree do look very angular in places.
<br /><br />saying all that, I think I`ll finish a basic layout of the first area or room that these are going into, then if the sp monsters and particles aren`t slowing the fps down too much I can add more polys <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p156981" date="Posted: Thu Sep 14, 2006 2:22 am "><author>kat</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Ohhh if they're part of a larger scene then yeah you can still up the polycount a bit to get better smoothing in game but don't go crazy.

<br /><br />Like Kat said, up the polys on the edges of the rocks to eliminate hard edges, you want to make the silhouette nice and smooth to make it look like it's got more polys than it looks.
<br /><br />Don't be affraid if you seen hits 100-150k tris and about 50k shadow tris, even cards like the 6600GT can handle that quite easily on high settings.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157258" date="Posted: Sat Sep 16, 2006 11:40 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">thanks zombie13, and so far I haven`t noticed any slow down with the models I`ve been adding to this map, although I`ve only been testing it with com_showfps, but I will start taking note of the tris if someone can remind me what the cvar to display them is?
<br /><br />and maybe because I don`t have tons of lights overlapping, but what ever the reason it looks like I will be able to increase the polycount on the parts of the map the player walks on at least <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />interesting suggestion you made about the silhouette edges being given higher polycounts, if I understand you correctly? so combined with the bump textures should give a good impression the over all polycount is higher then it really is, yes?
<br /><br />am I correct in thinking the d3 engine is very efficient at drawing particles, like used in smoke? and is that because they usually are just alpha or additive blended and not have bumps or specular texture stages to slow them down?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157286" date="Posted: Sat Sep 16, 2006 5:15 pm "><author>Zombie13</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">r_showprimitives 1 combined with con_noprint 1 will show you whats going on in your scene.
<br /><br />Every time a light is casting on a surface that surface has to be redendered again, so imagine what something like 8 lights would do? try and keep it to about 2-4 lights (I'm pretty sure there is a section here on D3W about lightcounts etc).
<br /><br />The D3 engine really isn't that efficient at drawing particles unlike some engines where it doesn't really bother it, but in saying that, having 3-4k tris worth of particles isn't going to hinder your scene much.
<br /><br />Yup having higher poly silhouette edges does make for nicer rock/terrain what ever.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157314" date="Posted: Sat Sep 16, 2006 7:28 pm "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">understood and thanks for your help zombie13 <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p157347" date="Posted: Sun Sep 17, 2006 3:53 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">not sure where to ask these questions so I`ll post them in here.

						<div class="postbody">these are the first images I`ve taken of this wip project. there of some floating (gravity defying) rocks I modeled in blender which the d3 player will traverse. I`ll ul some in game images tomorrow, if all goes well.
<br /><br />also uses one of my own rock textures, but in game I`m still using some local and height maps which came with d3, which I`ll replace with my own when I get round to modeling the local map in blender and painting the hieght map in psp7.

						<div class="postbody">thanks Zamideus, although you might be misjudging the scale, these are just rocks the player stands on and jumps between. I haven`t started yet modeling the lava pit room they are will go into but I intend to start on that today.
<br /><br />kit89 asked if I had some wire frame versions of the images so I`ll show you guys as well. I`ve tried to keep the polys as low as possible, and this is the first time I`ve modeled rocks using quads rather then tris, which kat had recommended I use quads where ever possible, and I can see why now, although I had to convert some of them to tris to control exactly where goofos .ase exporter would make the splits.
<br /><br />oh and I registered an account with photobucket.com yesterday but then their site went into some maintenance time, so I couldn`t link to the pics I was going to ul on there, in the mean time we`ll have to do without thumb images.

						<div class="postbody">Watch out for the height of those 'pathway' blocks from the ground. You'll need to drop them or raise the ground level around the edges so that the flat faces of the boxes are NO MORE THAN 8 units from any given surface otherwise you hit a wall and travel along the edge instead of up and over it (as you would normally do) becasue of the way the collisions system works. 
<br /><br />Don't be so stingy with the polycount either! Round off the sharp edges otherwise they'll look naff in game (that'll add a bit to the pCount if you do it on all the sharp/hard edges).</div>

						<div class="postbody">thanks kat, and the height of the "stepping stones" as I like to think of them, seems fine in game, as there is always a side of them which is only a few map units above the rock surface, and I`ve done lots of tests with the player walking, running and jumping on them, as well as comparing them to the ones from the original d3 hell maps, but I agree something we need to keep an eye on when placing these.
<br /><br />encouraging to hear you think I can increase the polycount on these rocks, which I would love to do if I can get away with it. I actually tried to keep about the same poly count as the originals, which I agree do look very angular in places.
<br /><br />saying all that, I think I`ll finish a basic layout of the first area or room that these are going into, then if the sp monsters and particles aren`t slowing the fps down too much I can add more polys <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>

<br /><br />Like Kat said, up the polys on the edges of the rocks to eliminate hard edges, you want to make the silhouette nice and smooth to make it look like it's got more polys than it looks.
<br /><br />Don't be affraid if you seen hits 100-150k tris and about 50k shadow tris, even cards like the 6600GT can handle that quite easily on high settings.</div>

						<div class="postbody">thanks zombie13, and so far I haven`t noticed any slow down with the models I`ve been adding to this map, although I`ve only been testing it with com_showfps, but I will start taking note of the tris if someone can remind me what the cvar to display them is?
<br /><br />and maybe because I don`t have tons of lights overlapping, but what ever the reason it looks like I will be able to increase the polycount on the parts of the map the player walks on at least <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />interesting suggestion you made about the silhouette edges being given higher polycounts, if I understand you correctly? so combined with the bump textures should give a good impression the over all polycount is higher then it really is, yes?
<br /><br />am I correct in thinking the d3 engine is very efficient at drawing particles, like used in smoke? and is that because they usually are just alpha or additive blended and not have bumps or specular texture stages to slow them down?</div>

						<div class="postbody">r_showprimitives 1 combined with con_noprint 1 will show you whats going on in your scene.
<br /><br />Every time a light is casting on a surface that surface has to be redendered again, so imagine what something like 8 lights would do? try and keep it to about 2-4 lights (I'm pretty sure there is a section here on D3W about lightcounts etc).
<br /><br />The D3 engine really isn't that efficient at drawing particles unlike some engines where it doesn't really bother it, but in saying that, having 3-4k tris worth of particles isn't going to hinder your scene much.
<br /><br />Yup having higher poly silhouette edges does make for nicer rock/terrain what ever.</div>

I haven`t started yet modeling the lava pit room they are will go into but I intend to start on that today.
<br /><br />kit89 asked if I had some wire frame versions of the images so I`ll show you guys as well. I`ve tried to keep the polys as low as possible, and this is the first time I`ve modeled rocks using quads rather then tris, which kat had recommended I use quads where ever possible, and I can see why now, although I had to convert some of them to tris to control exactly where goofos .ase exporter would make the splits.
<br /><br />oh and I registered an account with photobucket.com yesterday but then their site went into some maintenance time, so I couldn`t link to the pics I was going to ul on there, in the mean time we`ll have to do without thumb images.

<br /><br />encouraging to hear you think I can increase the polycount on these rocks, which I would love to do if I can get away with it. I actually tried to keep about the same poly count as the originals, which I agree do look very angular in places.
<br /><br />saying all that, I think I`ll finish a basic layout of the first area or room that these are going into, then if the sp monsters and particles aren`t slowing the fps down too much I can add more polys <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p156981" date="Posted: Thu Sep 14, 2006 2:22 am "><author>kat</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Ohhh if they're part of a larger scene then yeah you can still up the polycount a bit to get better smoothing in game but don't go crazy.

<br /><br />Like Kat said, up the polys on the edges of the rocks to eliminate hard edges, you want to make the silhouette nice and smooth to make it look like it's got more polys than it looks.
<br /><br />Don't be affraid if you seen hits 100-150k tris and about 50k shadow tris, even cards like the 6600GT can handle that quite easily on high settings.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157258" date="Posted: Sat Sep 16, 2006 11:40 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">thanks zombie13, and so far I haven`t noticed any slow down with the models I`ve been adding to this map, although I`ve only been testing it with com_showfps, but I will start taking note of the tris if someone can remind me what the cvar to display them is?
<br /><br />and maybe because I don`t have tons of lights overlapping, but what ever the reason it looks like I will be able to increase the polycount on the parts of the map the player walks on at least <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />interesting suggestion you made about the silhouette edges being given higher polycounts, if I understand you correctly? so combined with the bump textures should give a good impression the over all polycount is higher then it really is, yes?
<br /><br />am I correct in thinking the d3 engine is very efficient at drawing particles, like used in smoke? and is that because they usually are just alpha or additive blended and not have bumps or specular texture stages to slow them down?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157286" date="Posted: Sat Sep 16, 2006 5:15 pm "><author>Zombie13</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">r_showprimitives 1 combined with con_noprint 1 will show you whats going on in your scene.
<br /><br />Every time a light is casting on a surface that surface has to be redendered again, so imagine what something like 8 lights would do? try and keep it to about 2-4 lights (I'm pretty sure there is a section here on D3W about lightcounts etc).
<br /><br />The D3 engine really isn't that efficient at drawing particles unlike some engines where it doesn't really bother it, but in saying that, having 3-4k tris worth of particles isn't going to hinder your scene much.
<br /><br />Yup having higher poly silhouette edges does make for nicer rock/terrain what ever.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157314" date="Posted: Sat Sep 16, 2006 7:28 pm "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">understood and thanks for your help zombie13 <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p157347" date="Posted: Sun Sep 17, 2006 3:53 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">not sure where to ask these questions so I`ll post them in here.

						<div class="postbody">these are the first images I`ve taken of this wip project. there of some floating (gravity defying) rocks I modeled in blender which the d3 player will traverse. I`ll ul some in game images tomorrow, if all goes well.
<br /><br />also uses one of my own rock textures, but in game I`m still using some local and height maps which came with d3, which I`ll replace with my own when I get round to modeling the local map in blender and painting the hieght map in psp7.

						<div class="postbody">thanks Zamideus, although you might be misjudging the scale, these are just rocks the player stands on and jumps between. I haven`t started yet modeling the lava pit room they are will go into but I intend to start on that today.
<br /><br />kit89 asked if I had some wire frame versions of the images so I`ll show you guys as well. I`ve tried to keep the polys as low as possible, and this is the first time I`ve modeled rocks using quads rather then tris, which kat had recommended I use quads where ever possible, and I can see why now, although I had to convert some of them to tris to control exactly where goofos .ase exporter would make the splits.
<br /><br />oh and I registered an account with photobucket.com yesterday but then their site went into some maintenance time, so I couldn`t link to the pics I was going to ul on there, in the mean time we`ll have to do without thumb images.

						<div class="postbody">Watch out for the height of those 'pathway' blocks from the ground. You'll need to drop them or raise the ground level around the edges so that the flat faces of the boxes are NO MORE THAN 8 units from any given surface otherwise you hit a wall and travel along the edge instead of up and over it (as you would normally do) becasue of the way the collisions system works. 
<br /><br />Don't be so stingy with the polycount either! Round off the sharp edges otherwise they'll look naff in game (that'll add a bit to the pCount if you do it on all the sharp/hard edges).</div>

						<div class="postbody">thanks kat, and the height of the "stepping stones" as I like to think of them, seems fine in game, as there is always a side of them which is only a few map units above the rock surface, and I`ve done lots of tests with the player walking, running and jumping on them, as well as comparing them to the ones from the original d3 hell maps, but I agree something we need to keep an eye on when placing these.
<br /><br />encouraging to hear you think I can increase the polycount on these rocks, which I would love to do if I can get away with it. I actually tried to keep about the same poly count as the originals, which I agree do look very angular in places.
<br /><br />saying all that, I think I`ll finish a basic layout of the first area or room that these are going into, then if the sp monsters and particles aren`t slowing the fps down too much I can add more polys <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>

<br /><br />Like Kat said, up the polys on the edges of the rocks to eliminate hard edges, you want to make the silhouette nice and smooth to make it look like it's got more polys than it looks.
<br /><br />Don't be affraid if you seen hits 100-150k tris and about 50k shadow tris, even cards like the 6600GT can handle that quite easily on high settings.</div>

						<div class="postbody">thanks zombie13, and so far I haven`t noticed any slow down with the models I`ve been adding to this map, although I`ve only been testing it with com_showfps, but I will start taking note of the tris if someone can remind me what the cvar to display them is?
<br /><br />and maybe because I don`t have tons of lights overlapping, but what ever the reason it looks like I will be able to increase the polycount on the parts of the map the player walks on at least <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />interesting suggestion you made about the silhouette edges being given higher polycounts, if I understand you correctly? so combined with the bump textures should give a good impression the over all polycount is higher then it really is, yes?
<br /><br />am I correct in thinking the d3 engine is very efficient at drawing particles, like used in smoke? and is that because they usually are just alpha or additive blended and not have bumps or specular texture stages to slow them down?</div>

						<div class="postbody">r_showprimitives 1 combined with con_noprint 1 will show you whats going on in your scene.
<br /><br />Every time a light is casting on a surface that surface has to be redendered again, so imagine what something like 8 lights would do? try and keep it to about 2-4 lights (I'm pretty sure there is a section here on D3W about lightcounts etc).
<br /><br />The D3 engine really isn't that efficient at drawing particles unlike some engines where it doesn't really bother it, but in saying that, having 3-4k tris worth of particles isn't going to hinder your scene much.
<br /><br />Yup having higher poly silhouette edges does make for nicer rock/terrain what ever.</div>

I haven`t started yet modeling the lava pit room they are will go into but I intend to start on that today.
<br /><br />kit89 asked if I had some wire frame versions of the images so I`ll show you guys as well. I`ve tried to keep the polys as low as possible, and this is the first time I`ve modeled rocks using quads rather then tris, which kat had recommended I use quads where ever possible, and I can see why now, although I had to convert some of them to tris to control exactly where goofos .ase exporter would make the splits.
<br /><br />oh and I registered an account with photobucket.com yesterday but then their site went into some maintenance time, so I couldn`t link to the pics I was going to ul on there, in the mean time we`ll have to do without thumb images.

<br /><br />encouraging to hear you think I can increase the polycount on these rocks, which I would love to do if I can get away with it. I actually tried to keep about the same poly count as the originals, which I agree do look very angular in places.
<br /><br />saying all that, I think I`ll finish a basic layout of the first area or room that these are going into, then if the sp monsters and particles aren`t slowing the fps down too much I can add more polys <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p156981" date="Posted: Thu Sep 14, 2006 2:22 am "><author>kat</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Ohhh if they're part of a larger scene then yeah you can still up the polycount a bit to get better smoothing in game but don't go crazy.

<br /><br />Like Kat said, up the polys on the edges of the rocks to eliminate hard edges, you want to make the silhouette nice and smooth to make it look like it's got more polys than it looks.
<br /><br />Don't be affraid if you seen hits 100-150k tris and about 50k shadow tris, even cards like the 6600GT can handle that quite easily on high settings.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157258" date="Posted: Sat Sep 16, 2006 11:40 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">thanks zombie13, and so far I haven`t noticed any slow down with the models I`ve been adding to this map, although I`ve only been testing it with com_showfps, but I will start taking note of the tris if someone can remind me what the cvar to display them is?
<br /><br />and maybe because I don`t have tons of lights overlapping, but what ever the reason it looks like I will be able to increase the polycount on the parts of the map the player walks on at least <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />interesting suggestion you made about the silhouette edges being given higher polycounts, if I understand you correctly? so combined with the bump textures should give a good impression the over all polycount is higher then it really is, yes?
<br /><br />am I correct in thinking the d3 engine is very efficient at drawing particles, like used in smoke? and is that because they usually are just alpha or additive blended and not have bumps or specular texture stages to slow them down?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157286" date="Posted: Sat Sep 16, 2006 5:15 pm "><author>Zombie13</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">r_showprimitives 1 combined with con_noprint 1 will show you whats going on in your scene.
<br /><br />Every time a light is casting on a surface that surface has to be redendered again, so imagine what something like 8 lights would do? try and keep it to about 2-4 lights (I'm pretty sure there is a section here on D3W about lightcounts etc).
<br /><br />The D3 engine really isn't that efficient at drawing particles unlike some engines where it doesn't really bother it, but in saying that, having 3-4k tris worth of particles isn't going to hinder your scene much.
<br /><br />Yup having higher poly silhouette edges does make for nicer rock/terrain what ever.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157314" date="Posted: Sat Sep 16, 2006 7:28 pm "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">understood and thanks for your help zombie13 <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p157347" date="Posted: Sun Sep 17, 2006 3:53 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">not sure where to ask these questions so I`ll post them in here.

						<div class="postbody">these are the first images I`ve taken of this wip project. there of some floating (gravity defying) rocks I modeled in blender which the d3 player will traverse. I`ll ul some in game images tomorrow, if all goes well.
<br /><br />also uses one of my own rock textures, but in game I`m still using some local and height maps which came with d3, which I`ll replace with my own when I get round to modeling the local map in blender and painting the hieght map in psp7.

						<div class="postbody">thanks Zamideus, although you might be misjudging the scale, these are just rocks the player stands on and jumps between. I haven`t started yet modeling the lava pit room they are will go into but I intend to start on that today.
<br /><br />kit89 asked if I had some wire frame versions of the images so I`ll show you guys as well. I`ve tried to keep the polys as low as possible, and this is the first time I`ve modeled rocks using quads rather then tris, which kat had recommended I use quads where ever possible, and I can see why now, although I had to convert some of them to tris to control exactly where goofos .ase exporter would make the splits.
<br /><br />oh and I registered an account with photobucket.com yesterday but then their site went into some maintenance time, so I couldn`t link to the pics I was going to ul on there, in the mean time we`ll have to do without thumb images.

						<div class="postbody">Watch out for the height of those 'pathway' blocks from the ground. You'll need to drop them or raise the ground level around the edges so that the flat faces of the boxes are NO MORE THAN 8 units from any given surface otherwise you hit a wall and travel along the edge instead of up and over it (as you would normally do) becasue of the way the collisions system works. 
<br /><br />Don't be so stingy with the polycount either! Round off the sharp edges otherwise they'll look naff in game (that'll add a bit to the pCount if you do it on all the sharp/hard edges).</div>

						<div class="postbody">thanks kat, and the height of the "stepping stones" as I like to think of them, seems fine in game, as there is always a side of them which is only a few map units above the rock surface, and I`ve done lots of tests with the player walking, running and jumping on them, as well as comparing them to the ones from the original d3 hell maps, but I agree something we need to keep an eye on when placing these.
<br /><br />encouraging to hear you think I can increase the polycount on these rocks, which I would love to do if I can get away with it. I actually tried to keep about the same poly count as the originals, which I agree do look very angular in places.
<br /><br />saying all that, I think I`ll finish a basic layout of the first area or room that these are going into, then if the sp monsters and particles aren`t slowing the fps down too much I can add more polys <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>

<br /><br />Like Kat said, up the polys on the edges of the rocks to eliminate hard edges, you want to make the silhouette nice and smooth to make it look like it's got more polys than it looks.
<br /><br />Don't be affraid if you seen hits 100-150k tris and about 50k shadow tris, even cards like the 6600GT can handle that quite easily on high settings.</div>

						<div class="postbody">thanks zombie13, and so far I haven`t noticed any slow down with the models I`ve been adding to this map, although I`ve only been testing it with com_showfps, but I will start taking note of the tris if someone can remind me what the cvar to display them is?
<br /><br />and maybe because I don`t have tons of lights overlapping, but what ever the reason it looks like I will be able to increase the polycount on the parts of the map the player walks on at least <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />interesting suggestion you made about the silhouette edges being given higher polycounts, if I understand you correctly? so combined with the bump textures should give a good impression the over all polycount is higher then it really is, yes?
<br /><br />am I correct in thinking the d3 engine is very efficient at drawing particles, like used in smoke? and is that because they usually are just alpha or additive blended and not have bumps or specular texture stages to slow them down?</div>

						<div class="postbody">r_showprimitives 1 combined with con_noprint 1 will show you whats going on in your scene.
<br /><br />Every time a light is casting on a surface that surface has to be redendered again, so imagine what something like 8 lights would do? try and keep it to about 2-4 lights (I'm pretty sure there is a section here on D3W about lightcounts etc).
<br /><br />The D3 engine really isn't that efficient at drawing particles unlike some engines where it doesn't really bother it, but in saying that, having 3-4k tris worth of particles isn't going to hinder your scene much.
<br /><br />Yup having higher poly silhouette edges does make for nicer rock/terrain what ever.</div>

<br /><br />1. although I think I understand your tut, am I right in thinking it wouldn`t matter with rock textures and their local maps, as they would probably be acceptable in game, even if their orientation on the models and some of the local map axis were not aligned to their original up/down, left/right?
<br /><br />2. also do you have a preference over using .lwo or .ase model formats, both for the in game low poly models and the high poly local map versions?
<br /><br />3. and do all of the static model formats produce a smoothing seam where the uv maps have a seam in blender?</div>

I haven`t started yet modeling the lava pit room they are will go into but I intend to start on that today.
<br /><br />kit89 asked if I had some wire frame versions of the images so I`ll show you guys as well. I`ve tried to keep the polys as low as possible, and this is the first time I`ve modeled rocks using quads rather then tris, which kat had recommended I use quads where ever possible, and I can see why now, although I had to convert some of them to tris to control exactly where goofos .ase exporter would make the splits.
<br /><br />oh and I registered an account with photobucket.com yesterday but then their site went into some maintenance time, so I couldn`t link to the pics I was going to ul on there, in the mean time we`ll have to do without thumb images.

<br /><br />encouraging to hear you think I can increase the polycount on these rocks, which I would love to do if I can get away with it. I actually tried to keep about the same poly count as the originals, which I agree do look very angular in places.
<br /><br />saying all that, I think I`ll finish a basic layout of the first area or room that these are going into, then if the sp monsters and particles aren`t slowing the fps down too much I can add more polys <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p156981" date="Posted: Thu Sep 14, 2006 2:22 am "><author>kat</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Ohhh if they're part of a larger scene then yeah you can still up the polycount a bit to get better smoothing in game but don't go crazy.

<br /><br />Like Kat said, up the polys on the edges of the rocks to eliminate hard edges, you want to make the silhouette nice and smooth to make it look like it's got more polys than it looks.
<br /><br />Don't be affraid if you seen hits 100-150k tris and about 50k shadow tris, even cards like the 6600GT can handle that quite easily on high settings.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157258" date="Posted: Sat Sep 16, 2006 11:40 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">thanks zombie13, and so far I haven`t noticed any slow down with the models I`ve been adding to this map, although I`ve only been testing it with com_showfps, but I will start taking note of the tris if someone can remind me what the cvar to display them is?
<br /><br />and maybe because I don`t have tons of lights overlapping, but what ever the reason it looks like I will be able to increase the polycount on the parts of the map the player walks on at least <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />interesting suggestion you made about the silhouette edges being given higher polycounts, if I understand you correctly? so combined with the bump textures should give a good impression the over all polycount is higher then it really is, yes?
<br /><br />am I correct in thinking the d3 engine is very efficient at drawing particles, like used in smoke? and is that because they usually are just alpha or additive blended and not have bumps or specular texture stages to slow them down?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157286" date="Posted: Sat Sep 16, 2006 5:15 pm "><author>Zombie13</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">r_showprimitives 1 combined with con_noprint 1 will show you whats going on in your scene.
<br /><br />Every time a light is casting on a surface that surface has to be redendered again, so imagine what something like 8 lights would do? try and keep it to about 2-4 lights (I'm pretty sure there is a section here on D3W about lightcounts etc).
<br /><br />The D3 engine really isn't that efficient at drawing particles unlike some engines where it doesn't really bother it, but in saying that, having 3-4k tris worth of particles isn't going to hinder your scene much.
<br /><br />Yup having higher poly silhouette edges does make for nicer rock/terrain what ever.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157314" date="Posted: Sat Sep 16, 2006 7:28 pm "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">understood and thanks for your help zombie13 <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p157347" date="Posted: Sun Sep 17, 2006 3:53 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">not sure where to ask these questions so I`ll post them in here.

						<div class="postbody">these are the first images I`ve taken of this wip project. there of some floating (gravity defying) rocks I modeled in blender which the d3 player will traverse. I`ll ul some in game images tomorrow, if all goes well.
<br /><br />also uses one of my own rock textures, but in game I`m still using some local and height maps which came with d3, which I`ll replace with my own when I get round to modeling the local map in blender and painting the hieght map in psp7.

						<div class="postbody">thanks Zamideus, although you might be misjudging the scale, these are just rocks the player stands on and jumps between. I haven`t started yet modeling the lava pit room they are will go into but I intend to start on that today.
<br /><br />kit89 asked if I had some wire frame versions of the images so I`ll show you guys as well. I`ve tried to keep the polys as low as possible, and this is the first time I`ve modeled rocks using quads rather then tris, which kat had recommended I use quads where ever possible, and I can see why now, although I had to convert some of them to tris to control exactly where goofos .ase exporter would make the splits.
<br /><br />oh and I registered an account with photobucket.com yesterday but then their site went into some maintenance time, so I couldn`t link to the pics I was going to ul on there, in the mean time we`ll have to do without thumb images.

						<div class="postbody">Watch out for the height of those 'pathway' blocks from the ground. You'll need to drop them or raise the ground level around the edges so that the flat faces of the boxes are NO MORE THAN 8 units from any given surface otherwise you hit a wall and travel along the edge instead of up and over it (as you would normally do) becasue of the way the collisions system works. 
<br /><br />Don't be so stingy with the polycount either! Round off the sharp edges otherwise they'll look naff in game (that'll add a bit to the pCount if you do it on all the sharp/hard edges).</div>

						<div class="postbody">thanks kat, and the height of the "stepping stones" as I like to think of them, seems fine in game, as there is always a side of them which is only a few map units above the rock surface, and I`ve done lots of tests with the player walking, running and jumping on them, as well as comparing them to the ones from the original d3 hell maps, but I agree something we need to keep an eye on when placing these.
<br /><br />encouraging to hear you think I can increase the polycount on these rocks, which I would love to do if I can get away with it. I actually tried to keep about the same poly count as the originals, which I agree do look very angular in places.
<br /><br />saying all that, I think I`ll finish a basic layout of the first area or room that these are going into, then if the sp monsters and particles aren`t slowing the fps down too much I can add more polys <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>

<br /><br />Like Kat said, up the polys on the edges of the rocks to eliminate hard edges, you want to make the silhouette nice and smooth to make it look like it's got more polys than it looks.
<br /><br />Don't be affraid if you seen hits 100-150k tris and about 50k shadow tris, even cards like the 6600GT can handle that quite easily on high settings.</div>

						<div class="postbody">thanks zombie13, and so far I haven`t noticed any slow down with the models I`ve been adding to this map, although I`ve only been testing it with com_showfps, but I will start taking note of the tris if someone can remind me what the cvar to display them is?
<br /><br />and maybe because I don`t have tons of lights overlapping, but what ever the reason it looks like I will be able to increase the polycount on the parts of the map the player walks on at least <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />interesting suggestion you made about the silhouette edges being given higher polycounts, if I understand you correctly? so combined with the bump textures should give a good impression the over all polycount is higher then it really is, yes?
<br /><br />am I correct in thinking the d3 engine is very efficient at drawing particles, like used in smoke? and is that because they usually are just alpha or additive blended and not have bumps or specular texture stages to slow them down?</div>

						<div class="postbody">r_showprimitives 1 combined with con_noprint 1 will show you whats going on in your scene.
<br /><br />Every time a light is casting on a surface that surface has to be redendered again, so imagine what something like 8 lights would do? try and keep it to about 2-4 lights (I'm pretty sure there is a section here on D3W about lightcounts etc).
<br /><br />The D3 engine really isn't that efficient at drawing particles unlike some engines where it doesn't really bother it, but in saying that, having 3-4k tris worth of particles isn't going to hinder your scene much.
<br /><br />Yup having higher poly silhouette edges does make for nicer rock/terrain what ever.</div>

<br /><br />1. although I think I understand your tut, am I right in thinking it wouldn`t matter with rock textures and their local maps, as they would probably be acceptable in game, even if their orientation on the models and some of the local map axis were not aligned to their original up/down, left/right?
<br /><br />2. also do you have a preference over using .lwo or .ase model formats, both for the in game low poly models and the high poly local map versions?
<br /><br />3. and do all of the static model formats produce a smoothing seam where the uv maps have a seam in blender?</div>

I haven`t started yet modeling the lava pit room they are will go into but I intend to start on that today.
<br /><br />kit89 asked if I had some wire frame versions of the images so I`ll show you guys as well. I`ve tried to keep the polys as low as possible, and this is the first time I`ve modeled rocks using quads rather then tris, which kat had recommended I use quads where ever possible, and I can see why now, although I had to convert some of them to tris to control exactly where goofos .ase exporter would make the splits.
<br /><br />oh and I registered an account with photobucket.com yesterday but then their site went into some maintenance time, so I couldn`t link to the pics I was going to ul on there, in the mean time we`ll have to do without thumb images.

<br /><br />encouraging to hear you think I can increase the polycount on these rocks, which I would love to do if I can get away with it. I actually tried to keep about the same poly count as the originals, which I agree do look very angular in places.
<br /><br />saying all that, I think I`ll finish a basic layout of the first area or room that these are going into, then if the sp monsters and particles aren`t slowing the fps down too much I can add more polys <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p156981" date="Posted: Thu Sep 14, 2006 2:22 am "><author>kat</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Ohhh if they're part of a larger scene then yeah you can still up the polycount a bit to get better smoothing in game but don't go crazy.

<br /><br />Like Kat said, up the polys on the edges of the rocks to eliminate hard edges, you want to make the silhouette nice and smooth to make it look like it's got more polys than it looks.
<br /><br />Don't be affraid if you seen hits 100-150k tris and about 50k shadow tris, even cards like the 6600GT can handle that quite easily on high settings.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157258" date="Posted: Sat Sep 16, 2006 11:40 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">thanks zombie13, and so far I haven`t noticed any slow down with the models I`ve been adding to this map, although I`ve only been testing it with com_showfps, but I will start taking note of the tris if someone can remind me what the cvar to display them is?
<br /><br />and maybe because I don`t have tons of lights overlapping, but what ever the reason it looks like I will be able to increase the polycount on the parts of the map the player walks on at least <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />interesting suggestion you made about the silhouette edges being given higher polycounts, if I understand you correctly? so combined with the bump textures should give a good impression the over all polycount is higher then it really is, yes?
<br /><br />am I correct in thinking the d3 engine is very efficient at drawing particles, like used in smoke? and is that because they usually are just alpha or additive blended and not have bumps or specular texture stages to slow them down?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157286" date="Posted: Sat Sep 16, 2006 5:15 pm "><author>Zombie13</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">r_showprimitives 1 combined with con_noprint 1 will show you whats going on in your scene.
<br /><br />Every time a light is casting on a surface that surface has to be redendered again, so imagine what something like 8 lights would do? try and keep it to about 2-4 lights (I'm pretty sure there is a section here on D3W about lightcounts etc).
<br /><br />The D3 engine really isn't that efficient at drawing particles unlike some engines where it doesn't really bother it, but in saying that, having 3-4k tris worth of particles isn't going to hinder your scene much.
<br /><br />Yup having higher poly silhouette edges does make for nicer rock/terrain what ever.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157314" date="Posted: Sat Sep 16, 2006 7:28 pm "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">understood and thanks for your help zombie13 <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p157347" date="Posted: Sun Sep 17, 2006 3:53 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">not sure where to ask these questions so I`ll post them in here.

						<div class="postbody">thanks Zamideus, although you might be misjudging the scale, these are just rocks the player stands on and jumps between. I haven`t started yet modeling the lava pit room they are will go into but I intend to start on that today.
<br /><br />kit89 asked if I had some wire frame versions of the images so I`ll show you guys as well. I`ve tried to keep the polys as low as possible, and this is the first time I`ve modeled rocks using quads rather then tris, which kat had recommended I use quads where ever possible, and I can see why now, although I had to convert some of them to tris to control exactly where goofos .ase exporter would make the splits.
<br /><br />oh and I registered an account with photobucket.com yesterday but then their site went into some maintenance time, so I couldn`t link to the pics I was going to ul on there, in the mean time we`ll have to do without thumb images.

						<div class="postbody">Watch out for the height of those 'pathway' blocks from the ground. You'll need to drop them or raise the ground level around the edges so that the flat faces of the boxes are NO MORE THAN 8 units from any given surface otherwise you hit a wall and travel along the edge instead of up and over it (as you would normally do) becasue of the way the collisions system works. 
<br /><br />Don't be so stingy with the polycount either! Round off the sharp edges otherwise they'll look naff in game (that'll add a bit to the pCount if you do it on all the sharp/hard edges).</div>

						<div class="postbody">thanks kat, and the height of the "stepping stones" as I like to think of them, seems fine in game, as there is always a side of them which is only a few map units above the rock surface, and I`ve done lots of tests with the player walking, running and jumping on them, as well as comparing them to the ones from the original d3 hell maps, but I agree something we need to keep an eye on when placing these.
<br /><br />encouraging to hear you think I can increase the polycount on these rocks, which I would love to do if I can get away with it. I actually tried to keep about the same poly count as the originals, which I agree do look very angular in places.
<br /><br />saying all that, I think I`ll finish a basic layout of the first area or room that these are going into, then if the sp monsters and particles aren`t slowing the fps down too much I can add more polys <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>

<br /><br />Like Kat said, up the polys on the edges of the rocks to eliminate hard edges, you want to make the silhouette nice and smooth to make it look like it's got more polys than it looks.
<br /><br />Don't be affraid if you seen hits 100-150k tris and about 50k shadow tris, even cards like the 6600GT can handle that quite easily on high settings.</div>

						<div class="postbody">thanks zombie13, and so far I haven`t noticed any slow down with the models I`ve been adding to this map, although I`ve only been testing it with com_showfps, but I will start taking note of the tris if someone can remind me what the cvar to display them is?
<br /><br />and maybe because I don`t have tons of lights overlapping, but what ever the reason it looks like I will be able to increase the polycount on the parts of the map the player walks on at least <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />interesting suggestion you made about the silhouette edges being given higher polycounts, if I understand you correctly? so combined with the bump textures should give a good impression the over all polycount is higher then it really is, yes?
<br /><br />am I correct in thinking the d3 engine is very efficient at drawing particles, like used in smoke? and is that because they usually are just alpha or additive blended and not have bumps or specular texture stages to slow them down?</div>

						<div class="postbody">r_showprimitives 1 combined with con_noprint 1 will show you whats going on in your scene.
<br /><br />Every time a light is casting on a surface that surface has to be redendered again, so imagine what something like 8 lights would do? try and keep it to about 2-4 lights (I'm pretty sure there is a section here on D3W about lightcounts etc).
<br /><br />The D3 engine really isn't that efficient at drawing particles unlike some engines where it doesn't really bother it, but in saying that, having 3-4k tris worth of particles isn't going to hinder your scene much.
<br /><br />Yup having higher poly silhouette edges does make for nicer rock/terrain what ever.</div>

I haven`t started yet modeling the lava pit room they are will go into but I intend to start on that today.
<br /><br />kit89 asked if I had some wire frame versions of the images so I`ll show you guys as well. I`ve tried to keep the polys as low as possible, and this is the first time I`ve modeled rocks using quads rather then tris, which kat had recommended I use quads where ever possible, and I can see why now, although I had to convert some of them to tris to control exactly where goofos .ase exporter would make the splits.
<br /><br />oh and I registered an account with photobucket.com yesterday but then their site went into some maintenance time, so I couldn`t link to the pics I was going to ul on there, in the mean time we`ll have to do without thumb images.

<br /><br />encouraging to hear you think I can increase the polycount on these rocks, which I would love to do if I can get away with it. I actually tried to keep about the same poly count as the originals, which I agree do look very angular in places.
<br /><br />saying all that, I think I`ll finish a basic layout of the first area or room that these are going into, then if the sp monsters and particles aren`t slowing the fps down too much I can add more polys <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p156981" date="Posted: Thu Sep 14, 2006 2:22 am "><author>kat</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Ohhh if they're part of a larger scene then yeah you can still up the polycount a bit to get better smoothing in game but don't go crazy.

<br /><br />Like Kat said, up the polys on the edges of the rocks to eliminate hard edges, you want to make the silhouette nice and smooth to make it look like it's got more polys than it looks.
<br /><br />Don't be affraid if you seen hits 100-150k tris and about 50k shadow tris, even cards like the 6600GT can handle that quite easily on high settings.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157258" date="Posted: Sat Sep 16, 2006 11:40 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">thanks zombie13, and so far I haven`t noticed any slow down with the models I`ve been adding to this map, although I`ve only been testing it with com_showfps, but I will start taking note of the tris if someone can remind me what the cvar to display them is?
<br /><br />and maybe because I don`t have tons of lights overlapping, but what ever the reason it looks like I will be able to increase the polycount on the parts of the map the player walks on at least <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />interesting suggestion you made about the silhouette edges being given higher polycounts, if I understand you correctly? so combined with the bump textures should give a good impression the over all polycount is higher then it really is, yes?
<br /><br />am I correct in thinking the d3 engine is very efficient at drawing particles, like used in smoke? and is that because they usually are just alpha or additive blended and not have bumps or specular texture stages to slow them down?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157286" date="Posted: Sat Sep 16, 2006 5:15 pm "><author>Zombie13</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">r_showprimitives 1 combined with con_noprint 1 will show you whats going on in your scene.
<br /><br />Every time a light is casting on a surface that surface has to be redendered again, so imagine what something like 8 lights would do? try and keep it to about 2-4 lights (I'm pretty sure there is a section here on D3W about lightcounts etc).
<br /><br />The D3 engine really isn't that efficient at drawing particles unlike some engines where it doesn't really bother it, but in saying that, having 3-4k tris worth of particles isn't going to hinder your scene much.
<br /><br />Yup having higher poly silhouette edges does make for nicer rock/terrain what ever.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157314" date="Posted: Sat Sep 16, 2006 7:28 pm "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">understood and thanks for your help zombie13 <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p157347" date="Posted: Sun Sep 17, 2006 3:53 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">not sure where to ask these questions so I`ll post them in here.

						<div class="postbody">these are the first images I`ve taken of this wip project. there of some floating (gravity defying) rocks I modeled in blender which the d3 player will traverse. I`ll ul some in game images tomorrow, if all goes well.
<br /><br />also uses one of my own rock textures, but in game I`m still using some local and height maps which came with d3, which I`ll replace with my own when I get round to modeling the local map in blender and painting the hieght map in psp7.

						<div class="postbody">thanks Zamideus, although you might be misjudging the scale, these are just rocks the player stands on and jumps between. I haven`t started yet modeling the lava pit room they are will go into but I intend to start on that today.
<br /><br />kit89 asked if I had some wire frame versions of the images so I`ll show you guys as well. I`ve tried to keep the polys as low as possible, and this is the first time I`ve modeled rocks using quads rather then tris, which kat had recommended I use quads where ever possible, and I can see why now, although I had to convert some of them to tris to control exactly where goofos .ase exporter would make the splits.
<br /><br />oh and I registered an account with photobucket.com yesterday but then their site went into some maintenance time, so I couldn`t link to the pics I was going to ul on there, in the mean time we`ll have to do without thumb images.

						<div class="postbody">Watch out for the height of those 'pathway' blocks from the ground. You'll need to drop them or raise the ground level around the edges so that the flat faces of the boxes are NO MORE THAN 8 units from any given surface otherwise you hit a wall and travel along the edge instead of up and over it (as you would normally do) becasue of the way the collisions system works. 
<br /><br />Don't be so stingy with the polycount either! Round off the sharp edges otherwise they'll look naff in game (that'll add a bit to the pCount if you do it on all the sharp/hard edges).</div>

						<div class="postbody">thanks kat, and the height of the "stepping stones" as I like to think of them, seems fine in game, as there is always a side of them which is only a few map units above the rock surface, and I`ve done lots of tests with the player walking, running and jumping on them, as well as comparing them to the ones from the original d3 hell maps, but I agree something we need to keep an eye on when placing these.
<br /><br />encouraging to hear you think I can increase the polycount on these rocks, which I would love to do if I can get away with it. I actually tried to keep about the same poly count as the originals, which I agree do look very angular in places.
<br /><br />saying all that, I think I`ll finish a basic layout of the first area or room that these are going into, then if the sp monsters and particles aren`t slowing the fps down too much I can add more polys <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>

<br /><br />Like Kat said, up the polys on the edges of the rocks to eliminate hard edges, you want to make the silhouette nice and smooth to make it look like it's got more polys than it looks.
<br /><br />Don't be affraid if you seen hits 100-150k tris and about 50k shadow tris, even cards like the 6600GT can handle that quite easily on high settings.</div>

						<div class="postbody">thanks zombie13, and so far I haven`t noticed any slow down with the models I`ve been adding to this map, although I`ve only been testing it with com_showfps, but I will start taking note of the tris if someone can remind me what the cvar to display them is?
<br /><br />and maybe because I don`t have tons of lights overlapping, but what ever the reason it looks like I will be able to increase the polycount on the parts of the map the player walks on at least <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />interesting suggestion you made about the silhouette edges being given higher polycounts, if I understand you correctly? so combined with the bump textures should give a good impression the over all polycount is higher then it really is, yes?
<br /><br />am I correct in thinking the d3 engine is very efficient at drawing particles, like used in smoke? and is that because they usually are just alpha or additive blended and not have bumps or specular texture stages to slow them down?</div>

						<div class="postbody">r_showprimitives 1 combined with con_noprint 1 will show you whats going on in your scene.
<br /><br />Every time a light is casting on a surface that surface has to be redendered again, so imagine what something like 8 lights would do? try and keep it to about 2-4 lights (I'm pretty sure there is a section here on D3W about lightcounts etc).
<br /><br />The D3 engine really isn't that efficient at drawing particles unlike some engines where it doesn't really bother it, but in saying that, having 3-4k tris worth of particles isn't going to hinder your scene much.
<br /><br />Yup having higher poly silhouette edges does make for nicer rock/terrain what ever.</div>

<br /><br />2. also do you have a preference over using .lwo or .ase model formats, both for the in game low poly models and the high poly local map versions?

I haven`t started yet modeling the lava pit room they are will go into but I intend to start on that today.
<br /><br />kit89 asked if I had some wire frame versions of the images so I`ll show you guys as well. I`ve tried to keep the polys as low as possible, and this is the first time I`ve modeled rocks using quads rather then tris, which kat had recommended I use quads where ever possible, and I can see why now, although I had to convert some of them to tris to control exactly where goofos .ase exporter would make the splits.
<br /><br />oh and I registered an account with photobucket.com yesterday but then their site went into some maintenance time, so I couldn`t link to the pics I was going to ul on there, in the mean time we`ll have to do without thumb images.

<br /><br />encouraging to hear you think I can increase the polycount on these rocks, which I would love to do if I can get away with it. I actually tried to keep about the same poly count as the originals, which I agree do look very angular in places.
<br /><br />saying all that, I think I`ll finish a basic layout of the first area or room that these are going into, then if the sp monsters and particles aren`t slowing the fps down too much I can add more polys <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p156981" date="Posted: Thu Sep 14, 2006 2:22 am "><author>kat</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Ohhh if they're part of a larger scene then yeah you can still up the polycount a bit to get better smoothing in game but don't go crazy.

<br /><br />Like Kat said, up the polys on the edges of the rocks to eliminate hard edges, you want to make the silhouette nice and smooth to make it look like it's got more polys than it looks.
<br /><br />Don't be affraid if you seen hits 100-150k tris and about 50k shadow tris, even cards like the 6600GT can handle that quite easily on high settings.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157258" date="Posted: Sat Sep 16, 2006 11:40 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">thanks zombie13, and so far I haven`t noticed any slow down with the models I`ve been adding to this map, although I`ve only been testing it with com_showfps, but I will start taking note of the tris if someone can remind me what the cvar to display them is?
<br /><br />and maybe because I don`t have tons of lights overlapping, but what ever the reason it looks like I will be able to increase the polycount on the parts of the map the player walks on at least <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />interesting suggestion you made about the silhouette edges being given higher polycounts, if I understand you correctly? so combined with the bump textures should give a good impression the over all polycount is higher then it really is, yes?
<br /><br />am I correct in thinking the d3 engine is very efficient at drawing particles, like used in smoke? and is that because they usually are just alpha or additive blended and not have bumps or specular texture stages to slow them down?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157286" date="Posted: Sat Sep 16, 2006 5:15 pm "><author>Zombie13</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">r_showprimitives 1 combined with con_noprint 1 will show you whats going on in your scene.
<br /><br />Every time a light is casting on a surface that surface has to be redendered again, so imagine what something like 8 lights would do? try and keep it to about 2-4 lights (I'm pretty sure there is a section here on D3W about lightcounts etc).
<br /><br />The D3 engine really isn't that efficient at drawing particles unlike some engines where it doesn't really bother it, but in saying that, having 3-4k tris worth of particles isn't going to hinder your scene much.
<br /><br />Yup having higher poly silhouette edges does make for nicer rock/terrain what ever.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157314" date="Posted: Sat Sep 16, 2006 7:28 pm "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">understood and thanks for your help zombie13 <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p157347" date="Posted: Sun Sep 17, 2006 3:53 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">not sure where to ask these questions so I`ll post them in here.

						<div class="postbody">these are the first images I`ve taken of this wip project. there of some floating (gravity defying) rocks I modeled in blender which the d3 player will traverse. I`ll ul some in game images tomorrow, if all goes well.
<br /><br />also uses one of my own rock textures, but in game I`m still using some local and height maps which came with d3, which I`ll replace with my own when I get round to modeling the local map in blender and painting the hieght map in psp7.

						<div class="postbody">thanks Zamideus, although you might be misjudging the scale, these are just rocks the player stands on and jumps between. I haven`t started yet modeling the lava pit room they are will go into but I intend to start on that today.
<br /><br />kit89 asked if I had some wire frame versions of the images so I`ll show you guys as well. I`ve tried to keep the polys as low as possible, and this is the first time I`ve modeled rocks using quads rather then tris, which kat had recommended I use quads where ever possible, and I can see why now, although I had to convert some of them to tris to control exactly where goofos .ase exporter would make the splits.
<br /><br />oh and I registered an account with photobucket.com yesterday but then their site went into some maintenance time, so I couldn`t link to the pics I was going to ul on there, in the mean time we`ll have to do without thumb images.

						<div class="postbody">Watch out for the height of those 'pathway' blocks from the ground. You'll need to drop them or raise the ground level around the edges so that the flat faces of the boxes are NO MORE THAN 8 units from any given surface otherwise you hit a wall and travel along the edge instead of up and over it (as you would normally do) becasue of the way the collisions system works. 
<br /><br />Don't be so stingy with the polycount either! Round off the sharp edges otherwise they'll look naff in game (that'll add a bit to the pCount if you do it on all the sharp/hard edges).</div>

						<div class="postbody">thanks kat, and the height of the "stepping stones" as I like to think of them, seems fine in game, as there is always a side of them which is only a few map units above the rock surface, and I`ve done lots of tests with the player walking, running and jumping on them, as well as comparing them to the ones from the original d3 hell maps, but I agree something we need to keep an eye on when placing these.
<br /><br />encouraging to hear you think I can increase the polycount on these rocks, which I would love to do if I can get away with it. I actually tried to keep about the same poly count as the originals, which I agree do look very angular in places.
<br /><br />saying all that, I think I`ll finish a basic layout of the first area or room that these are going into, then if the sp monsters and particles aren`t slowing the fps down too much I can add more polys <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>

<br /><br />Like Kat said, up the polys on the edges of the rocks to eliminate hard edges, you want to make the silhouette nice and smooth to make it look like it's got more polys than it looks.
<br /><br />Don't be affraid if you seen hits 100-150k tris and about 50k shadow tris, even cards like the 6600GT can handle that quite easily on high settings.</div>

						<div class="postbody">thanks zombie13, and so far I haven`t noticed any slow down with the models I`ve been adding to this map, although I`ve only been testing it with com_showfps, but I will start taking note of the tris if someone can remind me what the cvar to display them is?
<br /><br />and maybe because I don`t have tons of lights overlapping, but what ever the reason it looks like I will be able to increase the polycount on the parts of the map the player walks on at least <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />interesting suggestion you made about the silhouette edges being given higher polycounts, if I understand you correctly? so combined with the bump textures should give a good impression the over all polycount is higher then it really is, yes?
<br /><br />am I correct in thinking the d3 engine is very efficient at drawing particles, like used in smoke? and is that because they usually are just alpha or additive blended and not have bumps or specular texture stages to slow them down?</div>

						<div class="postbody">r_showprimitives 1 combined with con_noprint 1 will show you whats going on in your scene.
<br /><br />Every time a light is casting on a surface that surface has to be redendered again, so imagine what something like 8 lights would do? try and keep it to about 2-4 lights (I'm pretty sure there is a section here on D3W about lightcounts etc).
<br /><br />The D3 engine really isn't that efficient at drawing particles unlike some engines where it doesn't really bother it, but in saying that, having 3-4k tris worth of particles isn't going to hinder your scene much.
<br /><br />Yup having higher poly silhouette edges does make for nicer rock/terrain what ever.</div>

<br /><br />1. although I think I understand your tut, am I right in thinking it wouldn`t matter with rock textures and their local maps, as they would probably be acceptable in game, even if their orientation on the models and some of the local map axis were not aligned to their original up/down, left/right?
<br /><br />2. also do you have a preference over using .lwo or .ase model formats, both for the in game low poly models and the high poly local map versions?
<br /><br />3. and do all of the static model formats produce a smoothing seam where the uv maps have a seam in blender?</div>

I haven`t started yet modeling the lava pit room they are will go into but I intend to start on that today.
<br /><br />kit89 asked if I had some wire frame versions of the images so I`ll show you guys as well. I`ve tried to keep the polys as low as possible, and this is the first time I`ve modeled rocks using quads rather then tris, which kat had recommended I use quads where ever possible, and I can see why now, although I had to convert some of them to tris to control exactly where goofos .ase exporter would make the splits.
<br /><br />oh and I registered an account with photobucket.com yesterday but then their site went into some maintenance time, so I couldn`t link to the pics I was going to ul on there, in the mean time we`ll have to do without thumb images.

<br /><br />encouraging to hear you think I can increase the polycount on these rocks, which I would love to do if I can get away with it. I actually tried to keep about the same poly count as the originals, which I agree do look very angular in places.
<br /><br />saying all that, I think I`ll finish a basic layout of the first area or room that these are going into, then if the sp monsters and particles aren`t slowing the fps down too much I can add more polys <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p156981" date="Posted: Thu Sep 14, 2006 2:22 am "><author>kat</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Ohhh if they're part of a larger scene then yeah you can still up the polycount a bit to get better smoothing in game but don't go crazy.

<br /><br />Like Kat said, up the polys on the edges of the rocks to eliminate hard edges, you want to make the silhouette nice and smooth to make it look like it's got more polys than it looks.
<br /><br />Don't be affraid if you seen hits 100-150k tris and about 50k shadow tris, even cards like the 6600GT can handle that quite easily on high settings.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157258" date="Posted: Sat Sep 16, 2006 11:40 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">thanks zombie13, and so far I haven`t noticed any slow down with the models I`ve been adding to this map, although I`ve only been testing it with com_showfps, but I will start taking note of the tris if someone can remind me what the cvar to display them is?
<br /><br />and maybe because I don`t have tons of lights overlapping, but what ever the reason it looks like I will be able to increase the polycount on the parts of the map the player walks on at least <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />interesting suggestion you made about the silhouette edges being given higher polycounts, if I understand you correctly? so combined with the bump textures should give a good impression the over all polycount is higher then it really is, yes?
<br /><br />am I correct in thinking the d3 engine is very efficient at drawing particles, like used in smoke? and is that because they usually are just alpha or additive blended and not have bumps or specular texture stages to slow them down?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157286" date="Posted: Sat Sep 16, 2006 5:15 pm "><author>Zombie13</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">r_showprimitives 1 combined with con_noprint 1 will show you whats going on in your scene.
<br /><br />Every time a light is casting on a surface that surface has to be redendered again, so imagine what something like 8 lights would do? try and keep it to about 2-4 lights (I'm pretty sure there is a section here on D3W about lightcounts etc).
<br /><br />The D3 engine really isn't that efficient at drawing particles unlike some engines where it doesn't really bother it, but in saying that, having 3-4k tris worth of particles isn't going to hinder your scene much.
<br /><br />Yup having higher poly silhouette edges does make for nicer rock/terrain what ever.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157314" date="Posted: Sat Sep 16, 2006 7:28 pm "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">understood and thanks for your help zombie13 <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p157347" date="Posted: Sun Sep 17, 2006 3:53 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">not sure where to ask these questions so I`ll post them in here.

						<div class="postbody">these are the first images I`ve taken of this wip project. there of some floating (gravity defying) rocks I modeled in blender which the d3 player will traverse. I`ll ul some in game images tomorrow, if all goes well.
<br /><br />also uses one of my own rock textures, but in game I`m still using some local and height maps which came with d3, which I`ll replace with my own when I get round to modeling the local map in blender and painting the hieght map in psp7.

						<div class="postbody">thanks Zamideus, although you might be misjudging the scale, these are just rocks the player stands on and jumps between. I haven`t started yet modeling the lava pit room they are will go into but I intend to start on that today.
<br /><br />kit89 asked if I had some wire frame versions of the images so I`ll show you guys as well. I`ve tried to keep the polys as low as possible, and this is the first time I`ve modeled rocks using quads rather then tris, which kat had recommended I use quads where ever possible, and I can see why now, although I had to convert some of them to tris to control exactly where goofos .ase exporter would make the splits.
<br /><br />oh and I registered an account with photobucket.com yesterday but then their site went into some maintenance time, so I couldn`t link to the pics I was going to ul on there, in the mean time we`ll have to do without thumb images.

						<div class="postbody">Watch out for the height of those 'pathway' blocks from the ground. You'll need to drop them or raise the ground level around the edges so that the flat faces of the boxes are NO MORE THAN 8 units from any given surface otherwise you hit a wall and travel along the edge instead of up and over it (as you would normally do) becasue of the way the collisions system works. 
<br /><br />Don't be so stingy with the polycount either! Round off the sharp edges otherwise they'll look naff in game (that'll add a bit to the pCount if you do it on all the sharp/hard edges).</div>

						<div class="postbody">thanks kat, and the height of the "stepping stones" as I like to think of them, seems fine in game, as there is always a side of them which is only a few map units above the rock surface, and I`ve done lots of tests with the player walking, running and jumping on them, as well as comparing them to the ones from the original d3 hell maps, but I agree something we need to keep an eye on when placing these.
<br /><br />encouraging to hear you think I can increase the polycount on these rocks, which I would love to do if I can get away with it. I actually tried to keep about the same poly count as the originals, which I agree do look very angular in places.
<br /><br />saying all that, I think I`ll finish a basic layout of the first area or room that these are going into, then if the sp monsters and particles aren`t slowing the fps down too much I can add more polys <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>

<br /><br />Like Kat said, up the polys on the edges of the rocks to eliminate hard edges, you want to make the silhouette nice and smooth to make it look like it's got more polys than it looks.
<br /><br />Don't be affraid if you seen hits 100-150k tris and about 50k shadow tris, even cards like the 6600GT can handle that quite easily on high settings.</div>

						<div class="postbody">thanks zombie13, and so far I haven`t noticed any slow down with the models I`ve been adding to this map, although I`ve only been testing it with com_showfps, but I will start taking note of the tris if someone can remind me what the cvar to display them is?
<br /><br />and maybe because I don`t have tons of lights overlapping, but what ever the reason it looks like I will be able to increase the polycount on the parts of the map the player walks on at least <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />interesting suggestion you made about the silhouette edges being given higher polycounts, if I understand you correctly? so combined with the bump textures should give a good impression the over all polycount is higher then it really is, yes?
<br /><br />am I correct in thinking the d3 engine is very efficient at drawing particles, like used in smoke? and is that because they usually are just alpha or additive blended and not have bumps or specular texture stages to slow them down?</div>

						<div class="postbody">r_showprimitives 1 combined with con_noprint 1 will show you whats going on in your scene.
<br /><br />Every time a light is casting on a surface that surface has to be redendered again, so imagine what something like 8 lights would do? try and keep it to about 2-4 lights (I'm pretty sure there is a section here on D3W about lightcounts etc).
<br /><br />The D3 engine really isn't that efficient at drawing particles unlike some engines where it doesn't really bother it, but in saying that, having 3-4k tris worth of particles isn't going to hinder your scene much.
<br /><br />Yup having higher poly silhouette edges does make for nicer rock/terrain what ever.</div>

I haven`t started yet modeling the lava pit room they are will go into but I intend to start on that today.
<br /><br />kit89 asked if I had some wire frame versions of the images so I`ll show you guys as well. I`ve tried to keep the polys as low as possible, and this is the first time I`ve modeled rocks using quads rather then tris, which kat had recommended I use quads where ever possible, and I can see why now, although I had to convert some of them to tris to control exactly where goofos .ase exporter would make the splits.
<br /><br />oh and I registered an account with photobucket.com yesterday but then their site went into some maintenance time, so I couldn`t link to the pics I was going to ul on there, in the mean time we`ll have to do without thumb images.

<br /><br />encouraging to hear you think I can increase the polycount on these rocks, which I would love to do if I can get away with it. I actually tried to keep about the same poly count as the originals, which I agree do look very angular in places.
<br /><br />saying all that, I think I`ll finish a basic layout of the first area or room that these are going into, then if the sp monsters and particles aren`t slowing the fps down too much I can add more polys <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p156981" date="Posted: Thu Sep 14, 2006 2:22 am "><author>kat</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Ohhh if they're part of a larger scene then yeah you can still up the polycount a bit to get better smoothing in game but don't go crazy.

<br /><br />Like Kat said, up the polys on the edges of the rocks to eliminate hard edges, you want to make the silhouette nice and smooth to make it look like it's got more polys than it looks.
<br /><br />Don't be affraid if you seen hits 100-150k tris and about 50k shadow tris, even cards like the 6600GT can handle that quite easily on high settings.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157258" date="Posted: Sat Sep 16, 2006 11:40 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">thanks zombie13, and so far I haven`t noticed any slow down with the models I`ve been adding to this map, although I`ve only been testing it with com_showfps, but I will start taking note of the tris if someone can remind me what the cvar to display them is?
<br /><br />and maybe because I don`t have tons of lights overlapping, but what ever the reason it looks like I will be able to increase the polycount on the parts of the map the player walks on at least <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />interesting suggestion you made about the silhouette edges being given higher polycounts, if I understand you correctly? so combined with the bump textures should give a good impression the over all polycount is higher then it really is, yes?
<br /><br />am I correct in thinking the d3 engine is very efficient at drawing particles, like used in smoke? and is that because they usually are just alpha or additive blended and not have bumps or specular texture stages to slow them down?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157286" date="Posted: Sat Sep 16, 2006 5:15 pm "><author>Zombie13</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">r_showprimitives 1 combined with con_noprint 1 will show you whats going on in your scene.
<br /><br />Every time a light is casting on a surface that surface has to be redendered again, so imagine what something like 8 lights would do? try and keep it to about 2-4 lights (I'm pretty sure there is a section here on D3W about lightcounts etc).
<br /><br />The D3 engine really isn't that efficient at drawing particles unlike some engines where it doesn't really bother it, but in saying that, having 3-4k tris worth of particles isn't going to hinder your scene much.
<br /><br />Yup having higher poly silhouette edges does make for nicer rock/terrain what ever.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157314" date="Posted: Sat Sep 16, 2006 7:28 pm "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">understood and thanks for your help zombie13 <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p157347" date="Posted: Sun Sep 17, 2006 3:53 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">not sure where to ask these questions so I`ll post them in here.

						<div class="postbody">these are the first images I`ve taken of this wip project. there of some floating (gravity defying) rocks I modeled in blender which the d3 player will traverse. I`ll ul some in game images tomorrow, if all goes well.
<br /><br />also uses one of my own rock textures, but in game I`m still using some local and height maps which came with d3, which I`ll replace with my own when I get round to modeling the local map in blender and painting the hieght map in psp7.

						<div class="postbody">thanks Zamideus, although you might be misjudging the scale, these are just rocks the player stands on and jumps between. I haven`t started yet modeling the lava pit room they are will go into but I intend to start on that today.
<br /><br />kit89 asked if I had some wire frame versions of the images so I`ll show you guys as well. I`ve tried to keep the polys as low as possible, and this is the first time I`ve modeled rocks using quads rather then tris, which kat had recommended I use quads where ever possible, and I can see why now, although I had to convert some of them to tris to control exactly where goofos .ase exporter would make the splits.
<br /><br />oh and I registered an account with photobucket.com yesterday but then their site went into some maintenance time, so I couldn`t link to the pics I was going to ul on there, in the mean time we`ll have to do without thumb images.

						<div class="postbody">Watch out for the height of those 'pathway' blocks from the ground. You'll need to drop them or raise the ground level around the edges so that the flat faces of the boxes are NO MORE THAN 8 units from any given surface otherwise you hit a wall and travel along the edge instead of up and over it (as you would normally do) becasue of the way the collisions system works. 
<br /><br />Don't be so stingy with the polycount either! Round off the sharp edges otherwise they'll look naff in game (that'll add a bit to the pCount if you do it on all the sharp/hard edges).</div>

						<div class="postbody">thanks kat, and the height of the "stepping stones" as I like to think of them, seems fine in game, as there is always a side of them which is only a few map units above the rock surface, and I`ve done lots of tests with the player walking, running and jumping on them, as well as comparing them to the ones from the original d3 hell maps, but I agree something we need to keep an eye on when placing these.
<br /><br />encouraging to hear you think I can increase the polycount on these rocks, which I would love to do if I can get away with it. I actually tried to keep about the same poly count as the originals, which I agree do look very angular in places.
<br /><br />saying all that, I think I`ll finish a basic layout of the first area or room that these are going into, then if the sp monsters and particles aren`t slowing the fps down too much I can add more polys <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>

						<div class="postbody">Ohhh if they're part of a larger scene then yeah you can still up the polycount a bit to get better smoothing in game but don't go crazy.

<br /><br />Like Kat said, up the polys on the edges of the rocks to eliminate hard edges, you want to make the silhouette nice and smooth to make it look like it's got more polys than it looks.
<br /><br />Don't be affraid if you seen hits 100-150k tris and about 50k shadow tris, even cards like the 6600GT can handle that quite easily on high settings.</div>

						<div class="postbody">thanks zombie13, and so far I haven`t noticed any slow down with the models I`ve been adding to this map, although I`ve only been testing it with com_showfps, but I will start taking note of the tris if someone can remind me what the cvar to display them is?
<br /><br />and maybe because I don`t have tons of lights overlapping, but what ever the reason it looks like I will be able to increase the polycount on the parts of the map the player walks on at least <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />interesting suggestion you made about the silhouette edges being given higher polycounts, if I understand you correctly? so combined with the bump textures should give a good impression the over all polycount is higher then it really is, yes?
<br /><br />am I correct in thinking the d3 engine is very efficient at drawing particles, like used in smoke? and is that because they usually are just alpha or additive blended and not have bumps or specular texture stages to slow them down?</div>

						<div class="postbody">r_showprimitives 1 combined with con_noprint 1 will show you whats going on in your scene.
<br /><br />Every time a light is casting on a surface that surface has to be redendered again, so imagine what something like 8 lights would do? try and keep it to about 2-4 lights (I'm pretty sure there is a section here on D3W about lightcounts etc).
<br /><br />The D3 engine really isn't that efficient at drawing particles unlike some engines where it doesn't really bother it, but in saying that, having 3-4k tris worth of particles isn't going to hinder your scene much.
<br /><br />Yup having higher poly silhouette edges does make for nicer rock/terrain what ever.</div>

<br /><br />1. although I think I understand your tut, am I right in thinking it wouldn`t matter with rock textures and their local maps, as they would probably be acceptable in game, even if their orientation on the models and some of the local map axis were not aligned to their original up/down, left/right?
<br /><br />2. also do you have a preference over using .lwo or .ase model formats, both for the in game low poly models and the high poly local map versions?
<br /><br />3. and do all of the static model formats produce a smoothing seam where the uv maps have a seam in blender?</div>

I haven`t started yet modeling the lava pit room they are will go into but I intend to start on that today.
<br /><br />kit89 asked if I had some wire frame versions of the images so I`ll show you guys as well. I`ve tried to keep the polys as low as possible, and this is the first time I`ve modeled rocks using quads rather then tris, which kat had recommended I use quads where ever possible, and I can see why now, although I had to convert some of them to tris to control exactly where goofos .ase exporter would make the splits.
<br /><br />oh and I registered an account with photobucket.com yesterday but then their site went into some maintenance time, so I couldn`t link to the pics I was going to ul on there, in the mean time we`ll have to do without thumb images.

<br /><br />encouraging to hear you think I can increase the polycount on these rocks, which I would love to do if I can get away with it. I actually tried to keep about the same poly count as the originals, which I agree do look very angular in places.
<br /><br />saying all that, I think I`ll finish a basic layout of the first area or room that these are going into, then if the sp monsters and particles aren`t slowing the fps down too much I can add more polys <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p156981" date="Posted: Thu Sep 14, 2006 2:22 am "><author>kat</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Ohhh if they're part of a larger scene then yeah you can still up the polycount a bit to get better smoothing in game but don't go crazy.

<br /><br />Like Kat said, up the polys on the edges of the rocks to eliminate hard edges, you want to make the silhouette nice and smooth to make it look like it's got more polys than it looks.
<br /><br />Don't be affraid if you seen hits 100-150k tris and about 50k shadow tris, even cards like the 6600GT can handle that quite easily on high settings.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157258" date="Posted: Sat Sep 16, 2006 11:40 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">thanks zombie13, and so far I haven`t noticed any slow down with the models I`ve been adding to this map, although I`ve only been testing it with com_showfps, but I will start taking note of the tris if someone can remind me what the cvar to display them is?
<br /><br />and maybe because I don`t have tons of lights overlapping, but what ever the reason it looks like I will be able to increase the polycount on the parts of the map the player walks on at least <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />interesting suggestion you made about the silhouette edges being given higher polycounts, if I understand you correctly? so combined with the bump textures should give a good impression the over all polycount is higher then it really is, yes?
<br /><br />am I correct in thinking the d3 engine is very efficient at drawing particles, like used in smoke? and is that because they usually are just alpha or additive blended and not have bumps or specular texture stages to slow them down?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157286" date="Posted: Sat Sep 16, 2006 5:15 pm "><author>Zombie13</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">r_showprimitives 1 combined with con_noprint 1 will show you whats going on in your scene.
<br /><br />Every time a light is casting on a surface that surface has to be redendered again, so imagine what something like 8 lights would do? try and keep it to about 2-4 lights (I'm pretty sure there is a section here on D3W about lightcounts etc).
<br /><br />The D3 engine really isn't that efficient at drawing particles unlike some engines where it doesn't really bother it, but in saying that, having 3-4k tris worth of particles isn't going to hinder your scene much.
<br /><br />Yup having higher poly silhouette edges does make for nicer rock/terrain what ever.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157314" date="Posted: Sat Sep 16, 2006 7:28 pm "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">understood and thanks for your help zombie13 <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p157347" date="Posted: Sun Sep 17, 2006 3:53 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">not sure where to ask these questions so I`ll post them in here.

						<div class="postbody">these are the first images I`ve taken of this wip project. there of some floating (gravity defying) rocks I modeled in blender which the d3 player will traverse. I`ll ul some in game images tomorrow, if all goes well.
<br /><br />also uses one of my own rock textures, but in game I`m still using some local and height maps which came with d3, which I`ll replace with my own when I get round to modeling the local map in blender and painting the hieght map in psp7.

						<div class="postbody">thanks Zamideus, although you might be misjudging the scale, these are just rocks the player stands on and jumps between. I haven`t started yet modeling the lava pit room they are will go into but I intend to start on that today.
<br /><br />kit89 asked if I had some wire frame versions of the images so I`ll show you guys as well. I`ve tried to keep the polys as low as possible, and this is the first time I`ve modeled rocks using quads rather then tris, which kat had recommended I use quads where ever possible, and I can see why now, although I had to convert some of them to tris to control exactly where goofos .ase exporter would make the splits.
<br /><br />oh and I registered an account with photobucket.com yesterday but then their site went into some maintenance time, so I couldn`t link to the pics I was going to ul on there, in the mean time we`ll have to do without thumb images.

						<div class="postbody">Watch out for the height of those 'pathway' blocks from the ground. You'll need to drop them or raise the ground level around the edges so that the flat faces of the boxes are NO MORE THAN 8 units from any given surface otherwise you hit a wall and travel along the edge instead of up and over it (as you would normally do) becasue of the way the collisions system works. 
<br /><br />Don't be so stingy with the polycount either! Round off the sharp edges otherwise they'll look naff in game (that'll add a bit to the pCount if you do it on all the sharp/hard edges).</div>

						<div class="postbody">thanks kat, and the height of the "stepping stones" as I like to think of them, seems fine in game, as there is always a side of them which is only a few map units above the rock surface, and I`ve done lots of tests with the player walking, running and jumping on them, as well as comparing them to the ones from the original d3 hell maps, but I agree something we need to keep an eye on when placing these.
<br /><br />encouraging to hear you think I can increase the polycount on these rocks, which I would love to do if I can get away with it. I actually tried to keep about the same poly count as the originals, which I agree do look very angular in places.
<br /><br />saying all that, I think I`ll finish a basic layout of the first area or room that these are going into, then if the sp monsters and particles aren`t slowing the fps down too much I can add more polys <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>

<br /><br />Like Kat said, up the polys on the edges of the rocks to eliminate hard edges, you want to make the silhouette nice and smooth to make it look like it's got more polys than it looks.
<br /><br />Don't be affraid if you seen hits 100-150k tris and about 50k shadow tris, even cards like the 6600GT can handle that quite easily on high settings.</div>

						<div class="postbody">thanks zombie13, and so far I haven`t noticed any slow down with the models I`ve been adding to this map, although I`ve only been testing it with com_showfps, but I will start taking note of the tris if someone can remind me what the cvar to display them is?
<br /><br />and maybe because I don`t have tons of lights overlapping, but what ever the reason it looks like I will be able to increase the polycount on the parts of the map the player walks on at least <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />interesting suggestion you made about the silhouette edges being given higher polycounts, if I understand you correctly? so combined with the bump textures should give a good impression the over all polycount is higher then it really is, yes?
<br /><br />am I correct in thinking the d3 engine is very efficient at drawing particles, like used in smoke? and is that because they usually are just alpha or additive blended and not have bumps or specular texture stages to slow them down?</div>

						<div class="postbody">r_showprimitives 1 combined with con_noprint 1 will show you whats going on in your scene.
<br /><br />Every time a light is casting on a surface that surface has to be redendered again, so imagine what something like 8 lights would do? try and keep it to about 2-4 lights (I'm pretty sure there is a section here on D3W about lightcounts etc).
<br /><br />The D3 engine really isn't that efficient at drawing particles unlike some engines where it doesn't really bother it, but in saying that, having 3-4k tris worth of particles isn't going to hinder your scene much.
<br /><br />Yup having higher poly silhouette edges does make for nicer rock/terrain what ever.</div>

I haven`t started yet modeling the lava pit room they are will go into but I intend to start on that today.
<br /><br />kit89 asked if I had some wire frame versions of the images so I`ll show you guys as well. I`ve tried to keep the polys as low as possible, and this is the first time I`ve modeled rocks using quads rather then tris, which kat had recommended I use quads where ever possible, and I can see why now, although I had to convert some of them to tris to control exactly where goofos .ase exporter would make the splits.
<br /><br />oh and I registered an account with photobucket.com yesterday but then their site went into some maintenance time, so I couldn`t link to the pics I was going to ul on there, in the mean time we`ll have to do without thumb images.

<br /><br />encouraging to hear you think I can increase the polycount on these rocks, which I would love to do if I can get away with it. I actually tried to keep about the same poly count as the originals, which I agree do look very angular in places.
<br /><br />saying all that, I think I`ll finish a basic layout of the first area or room that these are going into, then if the sp monsters and particles aren`t slowing the fps down too much I can add more polys <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p156981" date="Posted: Thu Sep 14, 2006 2:22 am "><author>kat</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Ohhh if they're part of a larger scene then yeah you can still up the polycount a bit to get better smoothing in game but don't go crazy.

<br /><br />Like Kat said, up the polys on the edges of the rocks to eliminate hard edges, you want to make the silhouette nice and smooth to make it look like it's got more polys than it looks.
<br /><br />Don't be affraid if you seen hits 100-150k tris and about 50k shadow tris, even cards like the 6600GT can handle that quite easily on high settings.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157258" date="Posted: Sat Sep 16, 2006 11:40 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">thanks zombie13, and so far I haven`t noticed any slow down with the models I`ve been adding to this map, although I`ve only been testing it with com_showfps, but I will start taking note of the tris if someone can remind me what the cvar to display them is?
<br /><br />and maybe because I don`t have tons of lights overlapping, but what ever the reason it looks like I will be able to increase the polycount on the parts of the map the player walks on at least <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />interesting suggestion you made about the silhouette edges being given higher polycounts, if I understand you correctly? so combined with the bump textures should give a good impression the over all polycount is higher then it really is, yes?
<br /><br />am I correct in thinking the d3 engine is very efficient at drawing particles, like used in smoke? and is that because they usually are just alpha or additive blended and not have bumps or specular texture stages to slow them down?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157286" date="Posted: Sat Sep 16, 2006 5:15 pm "><author>Zombie13</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">r_showprimitives 1 combined with con_noprint 1 will show you whats going on in your scene.
<br /><br />Every time a light is casting on a surface that surface has to be redendered again, so imagine what something like 8 lights would do? try and keep it to about 2-4 lights (I'm pretty sure there is a section here on D3W about lightcounts etc).
<br /><br />The D3 engine really isn't that efficient at drawing particles unlike some engines where it doesn't really bother it, but in saying that, having 3-4k tris worth of particles isn't going to hinder your scene much.
<br /><br />Yup having higher poly silhouette edges does make for nicer rock/terrain what ever.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157314" date="Posted: Sat Sep 16, 2006 7:28 pm "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">understood and thanks for your help zombie13 <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p157347" date="Posted: Sun Sep 17, 2006 3:53 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">not sure where to ask these questions so I`ll post them in here.

						<div class="postbody">these are the first images I`ve taken of this wip project. there of some floating (gravity defying) rocks I modeled in blender which the d3 player will traverse. I`ll ul some in game images tomorrow, if all goes well.
<br /><br />also uses one of my own rock textures, but in game I`m still using some local and height maps which came with d3, which I`ll replace with my own when I get round to modeling the local map in blender and painting the hieght map in psp7.

						<div class="postbody">thanks Zamideus, although you might be misjudging the scale, these are just rocks the player stands on and jumps between. I haven`t started yet modeling the lava pit room they are will go into but I intend to start on that today.
<br /><br />kit89 asked if I had some wire frame versions of the images so I`ll show you guys as well. I`ve tried to keep the polys as low as possible, and this is the first time I`ve modeled rocks using quads rather then tris, which kat had recommended I use quads where ever possible, and I can see why now, although I had to convert some of them to tris to control exactly where goofos .ase exporter would make the splits.
<br /><br />oh and I registered an account with photobucket.com yesterday but then their site went into some maintenance time, so I couldn`t link to the pics I was going to ul on there, in the mean time we`ll have to do without thumb images.

						<div class="postbody">Watch out for the height of those 'pathway' blocks from the ground. You'll need to drop them or raise the ground level around the edges so that the flat faces of the boxes are NO MORE THAN 8 units from any given surface otherwise you hit a wall and travel along the edge instead of up and over it (as you would normally do) becasue of the way the collisions system works. 
<br /><br />Don't be so stingy with the polycount either! Round off the sharp edges otherwise they'll look naff in game (that'll add a bit to the pCount if you do it on all the sharp/hard edges).</div>

						<div class="postbody">thanks kat, and the height of the "stepping stones" as I like to think of them, seems fine in game, as there is always a side of them which is only a few map units above the rock surface, and I`ve done lots of tests with the player walking, running and jumping on them, as well as comparing them to the ones from the original d3 hell maps, but I agree something we need to keep an eye on when placing these.
<br /><br />encouraging to hear you think I can increase the polycount on these rocks, which I would love to do if I can get away with it. I actually tried to keep about the same poly count as the originals, which I agree do look very angular in places.
<br /><br />saying all that, I think I`ll finish a basic layout of the first area or room that these are going into, then if the sp monsters and particles aren`t slowing the fps down too much I can add more polys <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>

<br /><br />Like Kat said, up the polys on the edges of the rocks to eliminate hard edges, you want to make the silhouette nice and smooth to make it look like it's got more polys than it looks.
<br /><br />Don't be affraid if you seen hits 100-150k tris and about 50k shadow tris, even cards like the 6600GT can handle that quite easily on high settings.</div>

						<div class="postbody">thanks zombie13, and so far I haven`t noticed any slow down with the models I`ve been adding to this map, although I`ve only been testing it with com_showfps, but I will start taking note of the tris if someone can remind me what the cvar to display them is?
<br /><br />and maybe because I don`t have tons of lights overlapping, but what ever the reason it looks like I will be able to increase the polycount on the parts of the map the player walks on at least <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />interesting suggestion you made about the silhouette edges being given higher polycounts, if I understand you correctly? so combined with the bump textures should give a good impression the over all polycount is higher then it really is, yes?
<br /><br />am I correct in thinking the d3 engine is very efficient at drawing particles, like used in smoke? and is that because they usually are just alpha or additive blended and not have bumps or specular texture stages to slow them down?</div>

						<div class="postbody">r_showprimitives 1 combined with con_noprint 1 will show you whats going on in your scene.
<br /><br />Every time a light is casting on a surface that surface has to be redendered again, so imagine what something like 8 lights would do? try and keep it to about 2-4 lights (I'm pretty sure there is a section here on D3W about lightcounts etc).
<br /><br />The D3 engine really isn't that efficient at drawing particles unlike some engines where it doesn't really bother it, but in saying that, having 3-4k tris worth of particles isn't going to hinder your scene much.
<br /><br />Yup having higher poly silhouette edges does make for nicer rock/terrain what ever.</div>

I haven`t started yet modeling the lava pit room they are will go into but I intend to start on that today.
<br /><br />kit89 asked if I had some wire frame versions of the images so I`ll show you guys as well. I`ve tried to keep the polys as low as possible, and this is the first time I`ve modeled rocks using quads rather then tris, which kat had recommended I use quads where ever possible, and I can see why now, although I had to convert some of them to tris to control exactly where goofos .ase exporter would make the splits.
<br /><br />oh and I registered an account with photobucket.com yesterday but then their site went into some maintenance time, so I couldn`t link to the pics I was going to ul on there, in the mean time we`ll have to do without thumb images.

<br /><br />encouraging to hear you think I can increase the polycount on these rocks, which I would love to do if I can get away with it. I actually tried to keep about the same poly count as the originals, which I agree do look very angular in places.
<br /><br />saying all that, I think I`ll finish a basic layout of the first area or room that these are going into, then if the sp monsters and particles aren`t slowing the fps down too much I can add more polys <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p156981" date="Posted: Thu Sep 14, 2006 2:22 am "><author>kat</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Ohhh if they're part of a larger scene then yeah you can still up the polycount a bit to get better smoothing in game but don't go crazy.

<br /><br />Like Kat said, up the polys on the edges of the rocks to eliminate hard edges, you want to make the silhouette nice and smooth to make it look like it's got more polys than it looks.
<br /><br />Don't be affraid if you seen hits 100-150k tris and about 50k shadow tris, even cards like the 6600GT can handle that quite easily on high settings.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157258" date="Posted: Sat Sep 16, 2006 11:40 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">thanks zombie13, and so far I haven`t noticed any slow down with the models I`ve been adding to this map, although I`ve only been testing it with com_showfps, but I will start taking note of the tris if someone can remind me what the cvar to display them is?
<br /><br />and maybe because I don`t have tons of lights overlapping, but what ever the reason it looks like I will be able to increase the polycount on the parts of the map the player walks on at least <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />interesting suggestion you made about the silhouette edges being given higher polycounts, if I understand you correctly? so combined with the bump textures should give a good impression the over all polycount is higher then it really is, yes?
<br /><br />am I correct in thinking the d3 engine is very efficient at drawing particles, like used in smoke? and is that because they usually are just alpha or additive blended and not have bumps or specular texture stages to slow them down?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157286" date="Posted: Sat Sep 16, 2006 5:15 pm "><author>Zombie13</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">r_showprimitives 1 combined with con_noprint 1 will show you whats going on in your scene.
<br /><br />Every time a light is casting on a surface that surface has to be redendered again, so imagine what something like 8 lights would do? try and keep it to about 2-4 lights (I'm pretty sure there is a section here on D3W about lightcounts etc).
<br /><br />The D3 engine really isn't that efficient at drawing particles unlike some engines where it doesn't really bother it, but in saying that, having 3-4k tris worth of particles isn't going to hinder your scene much.
<br /><br />Yup having higher poly silhouette edges does make for nicer rock/terrain what ever.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157314" date="Posted: Sat Sep 16, 2006 7:28 pm "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">understood and thanks for your help zombie13 <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p157347" date="Posted: Sun Sep 17, 2006 3:53 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">not sure where to ask these questions so I`ll post them in here.

						<div class="postbody">these are the first images I`ve taken of this wip project. there of some floating (gravity defying) rocks I modeled in blender which the d3 player will traverse. I`ll ul some in game images tomorrow, if all goes well.
<br /><br />also uses one of my own rock textures, but in game I`m still using some local and height maps which came with d3, which I`ll replace with my own when I get round to modeling the local map in blender and painting the hieght map in psp7.

						<div class="postbody">thanks Zamideus, although you might be misjudging the scale, these are just rocks the player stands on and jumps between. I haven`t started yet modeling the lava pit room they are will go into but I intend to start on that today.
<br /><br />kit89 asked if I had some wire frame versions of the images so I`ll show you guys as well. I`ve tried to keep the polys as low as possible, and this is the first time I`ve modeled rocks using quads rather then tris, which kat had recommended I use quads where ever possible, and I can see why now, although I had to convert some of them to tris to control exactly where goofos .ase exporter would make the splits.
<br /><br />oh and I registered an account with photobucket.com yesterday but then their site went into some maintenance time, so I couldn`t link to the pics I was going to ul on there, in the mean time we`ll have to do without thumb images.

						<div class="postbody">Watch out for the height of those 'pathway' blocks from the ground. You'll need to drop them or raise the ground level around the edges so that the flat faces of the boxes are NO MORE THAN 8 units from any given surface otherwise you hit a wall and travel along the edge instead of up and over it (as you would normally do) becasue of the way the collisions system works. 
<br /><br />Don't be so stingy with the polycount either! Round off the sharp edges otherwise they'll look naff in game (that'll add a bit to the pCount if you do it on all the sharp/hard edges).</div>

						<div class="postbody">thanks kat, and the height of the "stepping stones" as I like to think of them, seems fine in game, as there is always a side of them which is only a few map units above the rock surface, and I`ve done lots of tests with the player walking, running and jumping on them, as well as comparing them to the ones from the original d3 hell maps, but I agree something we need to keep an eye on when placing these.
<br /><br />encouraging to hear you think I can increase the polycount on these rocks, which I would love to do if I can get away with it. I actually tried to keep about the same poly count as the originals, which I agree do look very angular in places.
<br /><br />saying all that, I think I`ll finish a basic layout of the first area or room that these are going into, then if the sp monsters and particles aren`t slowing the fps down too much I can add more polys <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>

<br /><br />Like Kat said, up the polys on the edges of the rocks to eliminate hard edges, you want to make the silhouette nice and smooth to make it look like it's got more polys than it looks.
<br /><br />Don't be affraid if you seen hits 100-150k tris and about 50k shadow tris, even cards like the 6600GT can handle that quite easily on high settings.</div>

						<div class="postbody">thanks zombie13, and so far I haven`t noticed any slow down with the models I`ve been adding to this map, although I`ve only been testing it with com_showfps, but I will start taking note of the tris if someone can remind me what the cvar to display them is?
<br /><br />and maybe because I don`t have tons of lights overlapping, but what ever the reason it looks like I will be able to increase the polycount on the parts of the map the player walks on at least <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />interesting suggestion you made about the silhouette edges being given higher polycounts, if I understand you correctly? so combined with the bump textures should give a good impression the over all polycount is higher then it really is, yes?
<br /><br />am I correct in thinking the d3 engine is very efficient at drawing particles, like used in smoke? and is that because they usually are just alpha or additive blended and not have bumps or specular texture stages to slow them down?</div>

						<div class="postbody">r_showprimitives 1 combined with con_noprint 1 will show you whats going on in your scene.
<br /><br />Every time a light is casting on a surface that surface has to be redendered again, so imagine what something like 8 lights would do? try and keep it to about 2-4 lights (I'm pretty sure there is a section here on D3W about lightcounts etc).
<br /><br />The D3 engine really isn't that efficient at drawing particles unlike some engines where it doesn't really bother it, but in saying that, having 3-4k tris worth of particles isn't going to hinder your scene much.
<br /><br />Yup having higher poly silhouette edges does make for nicer rock/terrain what ever.</div>

I haven`t started yet modeling the lava pit room they are will go into but I intend to start on that today.
<br /><br />kit89 asked if I had some wire frame versions of the images so I`ll show you guys as well. I`ve tried to keep the polys as low as possible, and this is the first time I`ve modeled rocks using quads rather then tris, which kat had recommended I use quads where ever possible, and I can see why now, although I had to convert some of them to tris to control exactly where goofos .ase exporter would make the splits.
<br /><br />oh and I registered an account with photobucket.com yesterday but then their site went into some maintenance time, so I couldn`t link to the pics I was going to ul on there, in the mean time we`ll have to do without thumb images.

<br /><br />encouraging to hear you think I can increase the polycount on these rocks, which I would love to do if I can get away with it. I actually tried to keep about the same poly count as the originals, which I agree do look very angular in places.
<br /><br />saying all that, I think I`ll finish a basic layout of the first area or room that these are going into, then if the sp monsters and particles aren`t slowing the fps down too much I can add more polys <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p156981" date="Posted: Thu Sep 14, 2006 2:22 am "><author>kat</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Ohhh if they're part of a larger scene then yeah you can still up the polycount a bit to get better smoothing in game but don't go crazy.

<br /><br />Like Kat said, up the polys on the edges of the rocks to eliminate hard edges, you want to make the silhouette nice and smooth to make it look like it's got more polys than it looks.
<br /><br />Don't be affraid if you seen hits 100-150k tris and about 50k shadow tris, even cards like the 6600GT can handle that quite easily on high settings.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157258" date="Posted: Sat Sep 16, 2006 11:40 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">thanks zombie13, and so far I haven`t noticed any slow down with the models I`ve been adding to this map, although I`ve only been testing it with com_showfps, but I will start taking note of the tris if someone can remind me what the cvar to display them is?
<br /><br />and maybe because I don`t have tons of lights overlapping, but what ever the reason it looks like I will be able to increase the polycount on the parts of the map the player walks on at least <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />interesting suggestion you made about the silhouette edges being given higher polycounts, if I understand you correctly? so combined with the bump textures should give a good impression the over all polycount is higher then it really is, yes?
<br /><br />am I correct in thinking the d3 engine is very efficient at drawing particles, like used in smoke? and is that because they usually are just alpha or additive blended and not have bumps or specular texture stages to slow them down?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157286" date="Posted: Sat Sep 16, 2006 5:15 pm "><author>Zombie13</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">r_showprimitives 1 combined with con_noprint 1 will show you whats going on in your scene.
<br /><br />Every time a light is casting on a surface that surface has to be redendered again, so imagine what something like 8 lights would do? try and keep it to about 2-4 lights (I'm pretty sure there is a section here on D3W about lightcounts etc).
<br /><br />The D3 engine really isn't that efficient at drawing particles unlike some engines where it doesn't really bother it, but in saying that, having 3-4k tris worth of particles isn't going to hinder your scene much.
<br /><br />Yup having higher poly silhouette edges does make for nicer rock/terrain what ever.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157314" date="Posted: Sat Sep 16, 2006 7:28 pm "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">understood and thanks for your help zombie13 <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p157347" date="Posted: Sun Sep 17, 2006 3:53 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">not sure where to ask these questions so I`ll post them in here.

						<div class="postbody">these are the first images I`ve taken of this wip project. there of some floating (gravity defying) rocks I modeled in blender which the d3 player will traverse. I`ll ul some in game images tomorrow, if all goes well.
<br /><br />also uses one of my own rock textures, but in game I`m still using some local and height maps which came with d3, which I`ll replace with my own when I get round to modeling the local map in blender and painting the hieght map in psp7.

						<div class="postbody">thanks Zamideus, although you might be misjudging the scale, these are just rocks the player stands on and jumps between. I haven`t started yet modeling the lava pit room they are will go into but I intend to start on that today.
<br /><br />kit89 asked if I had some wire frame versions of the images so I`ll show you guys as well. I`ve tried to keep the polys as low as possible, and this is the first time I`ve modeled rocks using quads rather then tris, which kat had recommended I use quads where ever possible, and I can see why now, although I had to convert some of them to tris to control exactly where goofos .ase exporter would make the splits.
<br /><br />oh and I registered an account with photobucket.com yesterday but then their site went into some maintenance time, so I couldn`t link to the pics I was going to ul on there, in the mean time we`ll have to do without thumb images.

						<div class="postbody">Watch out for the height of those 'pathway' blocks from the ground. You'll need to drop them or raise the ground level around the edges so that the flat faces of the boxes are NO MORE THAN 8 units from any given surface otherwise you hit a wall and travel along the edge instead of up and over it (as you would normally do) becasue of the way the collisions system works. 
<br /><br />Don't be so stingy with the polycount either! Round off the sharp edges otherwise they'll look naff in game (that'll add a bit to the pCount if you do it on all the sharp/hard edges).</div>

						<div class="postbody">thanks kat, and the height of the "stepping stones" as I like to think of them, seems fine in game, as there is always a side of them which is only a few map units above the rock surface, and I`ve done lots of tests with the player walking, running and jumping on them, as well as comparing them to the ones from the original d3 hell maps, but I agree something we need to keep an eye on when placing these.
<br /><br />encouraging to hear you think I can increase the polycount on these rocks, which I would love to do if I can get away with it. I actually tried to keep about the same poly count as the originals, which I agree do look very angular in places.
<br /><br />saying all that, I think I`ll finish a basic layout of the first area or room that these are going into, then if the sp monsters and particles aren`t slowing the fps down too much I can add more polys <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>

<br /><br />Like Kat said, up the polys on the edges of the rocks to eliminate hard edges, you want to make the silhouette nice and smooth to make it look like it's got more polys than it looks.
<br /><br />Don't be affraid if you seen hits 100-150k tris and about 50k shadow tris, even cards like the 6600GT can handle that quite easily on high settings.</div>

						<div class="postbody">thanks zombie13, and so far I haven`t noticed any slow down with the models I`ve been adding to this map, although I`ve only been testing it with com_showfps, but I will start taking note of the tris if someone can remind me what the cvar to display them is?
<br /><br />and maybe because I don`t have tons of lights overlapping, but what ever the reason it looks like I will be able to increase the polycount on the parts of the map the player walks on at least <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />interesting suggestion you made about the silhouette edges being given higher polycounts, if I understand you correctly? so combined with the bump textures should give a good impression the over all polycount is higher then it really is, yes?
<br /><br />am I correct in thinking the d3 engine is very efficient at drawing particles, like used in smoke? and is that because they usually are just alpha or additive blended and not have bumps or specular texture stages to slow them down?</div>

						<div class="postbody">r_showprimitives 1 combined with con_noprint 1 will show you whats going on in your scene.
<br /><br />Every time a light is casting on a surface that surface has to be redendered again, so imagine what something like 8 lights would do? try and keep it to about 2-4 lights (I'm pretty sure there is a section here on D3W about lightcounts etc).
<br /><br />The D3 engine really isn't that efficient at drawing particles unlike some engines where it doesn't really bother it, but in saying that, having 3-4k tris worth of particles isn't going to hinder your scene much.
<br /><br />Yup having higher poly silhouette edges does make for nicer rock/terrain what ever.</div>

<br /><br />2. also do you have a preference over using .lwo or .ase model formats, both for the in game low poly models and the high poly local map versions?
<br /><br />3. and do all of the static model formats produce a smoothing seam where the uv maps have a seam in blender?</div>

<br /><br />kit89 asked if I had some wire frame versions of the images so I`ll show you guys as well. I`ve tried to keep the polys as low as possible, and this is the first time I`ve modeled rocks using quads rather then tris, which kat had recommended I use quads where ever possible, and I can see why now, although I had to convert some of them to tris to control exactly where goofos .ase exporter would make the splits.
<br /><br />oh and I registered an account with photobucket.com yesterday but then their site went into some maintenance time, so I couldn`t link to the pics I was going to ul on there, in the mean time we`ll have to do without thumb images.

<br /><br />encouraging to hear you think I can increase the polycount on these rocks, which I would love to do if I can get away with it. I actually tried to keep about the same poly count as the originals, which I agree do look very angular in places.
<br /><br />saying all that, I think I`ll finish a basic layout of the first area or room that these are going into, then if the sp monsters and particles aren`t slowing the fps down too much I can add more polys <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120315224050im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p156981" date="Posted: Thu Sep 14, 2006 3:22 am "><author>kat</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Ohhh if they're part of a larger scene then yeah you can still up the polycount a bit to get better smoothing in game but don't go crazy.

<br /><br />Like Kat said, up the polys on the edges of the rocks to eliminate hard edges, you want to make the silhouette nice and smooth to make it look like it's got more polys than it looks.
<br /><br />Don't be affraid if you seen hits 100-150k tris and about 50k shadow tris, even cards like the 6600GT can handle that quite easily on high settings.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157258" date="Posted: Sat Sep 16, 2006 12:40 pm "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">thanks zombie13, and so far I haven`t noticed any slow down with the models I`ve been adding to this map, although I`ve only been testing it with com_showfps, but I will start taking note of the tris if someone can remind me what the cvar to display them is?
<br /><br />and maybe because I don`t have tons of lights overlapping, but what ever the reason it looks like I will be able to increase the polycount on the parts of the map the player walks on at least <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120315224050im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />interesting suggestion you made about the silhouette edges being given higher polycounts, if I understand you correctly? so combined with the bump textures should give a good impression the over all polycount is higher then it really is, yes?
<br /><br />am I correct in thinking the d3 engine is very efficient at drawing particles, like used in smoke? and is that because they usually are just alpha or additive blended and not have bumps or specular texture stages to slow them down?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157286" date="Posted: Sat Sep 16, 2006 6:15 pm "><author>Zombie13</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">r_showprimitives 1 combined with con_noprint 1 will show you whats going on in your scene.
<br /><br />Every time a light is casting on a surface that surface has to be redendered again, so imagine what something like 8 lights would do? try and keep it to about 2-4 lights (I'm pretty sure there is a section here on D3W about lightcounts etc).
<br /><br />The D3 engine really isn't that efficient at drawing particles unlike some engines where it doesn't really bother it, but in saying that, having 3-4k tris worth of particles isn't going to hinder your scene much.

If you render out a normal map from the 1st image by then applying that verticle 'trim' to a model along the horizontal you'll create a 'flipped' channel becasue of the way the Nmap was created.
<br /><br />Rotating and moving UVWs don't make any difference in terms of 'fixing' the problem becasue it's a problem at source, on the image itself.
<br /><br />But using a 'correct' normal map has no effect when UVWmapped as the game 'compensates' for it (for want of a better term)
<br /><br />2 : I've not yet fully tested LWO models other than to solve that smoothing issue mentioned in the 'prepping LWO models tutorial'. I've got a multimaterial terrain mesh section to try out but have yet to do so.
<br /><br />3 : You mean an actual UVWmap split? A map physically broken into two sections (for example). Yes whereever there is a break in a UVWmap you get a seam in game, you can't avoid that (for terrain you can't use that tangentspace material parameter you see in character models).
<br /><br />If you're talking about Blender UVW (mark) seams then no those have no effect whatsoever one the exported model; it's basically just an 'internal' helper for Blender.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p157350" date="Posted: Sun Sep 17, 2006 5:45 am "><author>ratty redemption</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">thanks kat,
<br /><br />1. understood and that`s good to hear, so I assume in blender I could even have my uv maps upside down or rotated 90 degrees on the terrain models, as long as the local map used in game as been generated using correct axis, yes?
<br /><br />2. understood and I`ll go read that tut of yours again as it was months ago I last read it.
<br /><br />3. understood and sorry, I ment a physical split where two or more meshes with different materials in blender are combined and exported as one .ase or .lwo which then produces a shadow seam in game.
