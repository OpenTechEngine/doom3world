It'll then scale it by half... to make a texture twice as big, put in "0.5" then press enter... etc etc etc.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quotetitle">kan3 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">lastly - I put a light in my map and it worked fine in respects to illumination and I could move it v/h in rendermode and watch it move but when I changed the color or light radius they didn't change..even after a rebuild??</div>&#13;<br />No no no no no nonononono onono noo.&#13;<br /><br />When you have your light selected press "J", not "N", there is a brand new Light Editor for changing the radius and many other things. You must make sure you are in Windowed mode, not fullscreen.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p31749" date="Posted: Tue Aug 10, 2004 2:09 am "><author>kan3</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">thanks much, but in regards to question #2 - why would they decrease functionality...easy and quick scrolling vs manually entering values?  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p31875" date="Posted: Tue Aug 10, 2004 6:54 am "><author>bigboyg</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">kan3 wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">thanks much, but in regards to question #2 - why would they decrease functionality...easy and quick scrolling vs manually entering values?  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181516im_/http://doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /></div>&#13;<br /><br />I agree. I keep thinking I must be missing something. Why would they take a step backwards? Now I have to play with so many different figures to get a texture as I want it.
