I never found much use in jumping during Z-Hunter, but NX-317 fixes that here.</div><br /><div class="quotetitle"><b>Quote:</b></div><div class="quotecontent">Mapping work is generally on the strong side with well picked and aligned textures.

Anyway, here's a more proper review.<br /><br />The level design is great. The map fits very well for the end of the actual mod. The transition from Temple to Facility and then to Temple again fits very well. From the boss fights, I actually loved very much the Archvile and the Two Hellknights ones. The flying monsters are a bit hard to kill due to the fact that when you hit them they tend to go higher for a while. Even so, with the architecture great, and the good monster placement, I'd give this a 10/10 <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130320021440im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p247319" date="Posted: Fri Mar 08, 2013 3:06 pm "><author>NX-317</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Thank you very much, reko!
