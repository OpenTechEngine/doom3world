We had a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224205459/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?f=26&amp;t=22419" class="postlink">boss monster</a> contest, then we had a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224205459/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?f=26&amp;t=22470" class="postlink">weapon contest</a>.<br /><br />Of course the next logical choice is a MUSIC VIDEO!<br /><br />Yes, it sounds a little along the line of "wow, that's a toughie" but hey, there's prizes for 1st place involved.  But before you think "but I can't make a music video in Doom 3", check out the rules:<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">1) All music must be used legally. </span> IE you need proof of permission OR needs to be public domain (I don't believe any audio recordings are public domain at this point)/creative commons (check the license.  some don't allow you to make derivative works, which this IS considered.  Also called "syncing".  You can get separate permission from the author)/make your own.  This means you can also make a parody of an existing song.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">2) All video must be from Doom 3.</span>  No stock footage, special FX clips, etc. from outside sources.  Unless it's used in the game Doom 3. (So, technically, you can get some stock footage, make it as a movie texture in the game &amp; project it in the game &amp; use it that way)<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">3) Can be edited in any program you want.</span>  You can make a Doom 3 map/mod that plays the music &amp; people play the map, you can render the frames out &amp; edit in an editor and then hand out a Windows Media/Quicktime file, you can make a cinematic that people watch.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">4) Can do anything with the Doom 3 engine.</span>  You can change code, you can make new assets, whatever you need to do.  The sky's the limit.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">5) When you submit your entry</span> you'll need everything that's required to view the entry (video files, assets, map files, etc), a readme.txt explaining how to view it (play the video, install &amp; run the map, etc) &amp; your source of music &amp; the proof you can use it (a link to the site you got it, a copy of the license from the stock music library, saying that you created it, etc).<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">6) Contest is open to ANYONE.</span>  You don't need to be a member of Doom3World.org to participate.  Feel free to post this anywhere &amp; everywhere!<br /><br />Here's the prizes for 1st (sorry, only the top dog gets something):<br />*A SIGNED copy of "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224205459/http://www.darksalvation.com/" class="postlink">Dark Salvation</a>" by Mangeled Eye Studios.<br />*A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224205459/http://alteredsoftworks.com/chsaw/finished/" class="postlink">REAL LIFESIZE Doom 3 Chainsaw</a> created by Paril, the one behind all the Quake 2 paper models <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224205459/http://tastyspleen.net/quake/forums/index.php?topic=9558.0" class="postlink">here</a> &amp; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224205459/http://tastyspleen.net/quake/forums/index.php?topic=11340.0" class="postlink">here</a><br />*A copy of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224205459/http://www.unknownworlds.com/ns2/" class="postlink">Natural Selection 2:SE</a><br /><br />Now you may be thinking "I really could use some direction here...":<br />*All of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224205459/http://www.jonathancoulton.com/store/downloads/" class="postlink">Jonathan Coulton's</a> music (except covers) are compatible with the contest.<br />*<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224205459/http://www.blender.org/" class="postlink">Blender</a> has a built in video editor (Video Sequence Editor).  Sony gives a 30 day unlimited trial of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224205459/http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/vegassoftware" class="postlink">Vegas</a>.  Either of these could be used for editing or converting an image sequence to video.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224205459/http://www.virtualdub.org/" class="postlink">Virtual Dub</a> is free also.<br /><br />This contest will have slightly different judging criteria.  Instead of a vote by members of the forum, a panel of judges will decide on the winners.  Judges to be announced.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">The contest will end on May 31st @ 23:59 EST.</span>  That gives everybody ~3 months.  Anything after the deadline will happily be shown &amp; viewed but won't be considered for judging.<br /><br /><div class="attachtitle">Attachment:</div><div class="attachcontent">			<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224205459im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/download/file.php?id=365" alt="contest3_image_rockon.jpg" /><br /><span class="gensmall">contest3_image_rockon.jpg [ 70.75 KB | Viewed 1058 times ]</span>

The only one I could actually find for download was Neurological's "Pathfinder" weapon.  The other 2 belonged to The Happy Friar and Whitewolf, with now broken links.  Is there a place where the others could be downloaded?  I assumed there would be a winner (I couldn't even figured out who won) and a download with combination of all contest entries.  It's like the thread just ran into a brick wall.<br /><br />The thread says "POLL CLOSED - THE CUSTOM WEAPON HAS WON WITH 17 VOTES"<br />"The custom weapon" won, apparently.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224205459im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_surprised.gif" alt=":o" title="Surprised" /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224205459im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_question.gif" alt=":?:" title="Question" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p222869" date="Posted: Thu Mar 04, 2010 8:22 am "><author>BNA!</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I screwed up the last contest by screwing up the mailserver - it's a shame beyond any available words to express it.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p222872" date="Posted: Thu Mar 04, 2010 5:27 pm "><author>The Happy Friar</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">LDAsh wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">The other 2 belonged to The Happy Friar and Whitewolf, with now broken links.</div><br /><br />My link still works (fileplanet).
