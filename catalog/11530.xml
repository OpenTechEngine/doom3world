<br/><br/>
Goliath's "Modeling and texturing in Doom 3" tutorial is pretty good. It can be found here: <a href="/web/20061012183955/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=1884&amp;highlight=goliath+modeling" target="_blank" class="postlink">http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=1884&amp;highlight=goliath+modeling</a>&#13;
<br/>
I've also followed through the UV mapping tutorials from Lightwave's built-in help section: in Lightwave, hit "F1" to launch it, then search for "UV tutorial". &#13;
<br/>
It's also been very helpful to look at Id's UV maps.&#13;
<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Silly Problems I Ran Into</span> (and their solutions)&#13;
<br/>
Problem- I made a UV map and saved my object file. When I reopened the file, I couldn't see the UV map, even if I set one of the views to "UV Texture".&#13;
<br/>
Solution- Press F8 to open the Vertex Maps Panel. Select your saved map from the Texture section.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Problem- Model meshes appear in Doom 3, but are totally black. In the console, it says: WARNING: Couldn't load image: &lt;insert name here&gt;.&#13;
<br/>
Solution- This seems to happen when the material definition's name doesn't match the name of the model's surface.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Problem- Model meshes appear textured in Doom 3, but there are noticeable seams in the normal map.&#13;
<br/>
Solution- The seams appear at places where the UV map isn't continuous. All I've learned to do is hide UV seams whenever possible. It's also a good idea to plan object shapes with UV mapping in mind.&#13;
<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Unanswered Questions</span>&#13;
<br/>
I haven't tinkered with Doom 3's built in "renderbump" command yet. How does this compare to Normal Map Create?&#13;
<br/><br/>
When a low detail mesh has extremely high angles between polygons, the plugin "breaks" at the edge instead of rendering a continuous surface. There's a "Cutoff Angle" setting in the plugin's interface, but it's already set at the highest level. Are there workarounds?</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

<br />I haven't tinkered with Doom 3's built in "renderbump" command yet. How does this compare to Normal Map Create?
<br /><br />When a low detail mesh has extremely high angles between polygons, the plugin "breaks" at the edge instead of rendering a continuous surface. There's a "Cutoff Angle" setting in the plugin's interface, but it's already set at the highest level. Are there workarounds?</div>]]></body></post><post id="p104157" date="Posted: Fri Jul 15, 2005 5:26 pm "><author>Enforcer</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">The d3 rendermap from what i hear is very kewl you actually see each pixel of the model or triangle of the model being built in front of you.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p104162" date="Posted: Fri Jul 15, 2005 5:41 pm "><author>Fingernail</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Caution, if that's the same plugin we used for a while, then it's a bit weird.

<br /><br />Goliath's "Modeling and texturing in Doom 3" tutorial is pretty good. It can be found here: <a href="viewtopic.php?t=1884&amp;highlight=goliath+modeling" class="postlink">http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=1884&amp;highlight=goliath+modeling</a>
<br />I've also followed through the UV mapping tutorials from Lightwave's built-in help section: in Lightwave, hit "F1" to launch it, then search for "UV tutorial". 
<br />It's also been very helpful to look at Id's UV maps.
<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Silly Problems I Ran Into</span> (and their solutions)
<br />Problem- I made a UV map and saved my object file. When I reopened the file, I couldn't see the UV map, even if I set one of the views to "UV Texture".
<br />Solution- Press F8 to open the Vertex Maps Panel. Select your saved map from the Texture section.
<br /><br />Problem- Model meshes appear in Doom 3, but are totally black. In the console, it says: WARNING: Couldn't load image: &lt;insert name here&gt;.
<br />Solution- This seems to happen when the material definition's name doesn't match the name of the model's surface.
<br /><br />Problem- Model meshes appear textured in Doom 3, but there are noticeable seams in the normal map.
<br />Solution- The seams appear at places where the UV map isn't continuous. All I've learned to do is hide UV seams whenever possible. It's also a good idea to plan object shapes with UV mapping in mind.

I've also followed through the UV mapping tutorials from Lightwave's built-in help section: in Lightwave, hit "F1" to launch it, then search for "UV tutorial". &#13;
<br/>
It's also been very helpful to look at Id's UV maps.&#13;
<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold">Silly Problems I Ran Into</span> (and their solutions)&#13;
<br/>
Problem- I made a UV map and saved my object file. When I reopened the file, I couldn't see the UV map, even if I set one of the views to "UV Texture".&#13;
<br/>
Solution- Press F8 to open the Vertex Maps Panel. Select your saved map from the Texture section.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Problem- Model meshes appear in Doom 3, but are totally black. In the console, it says: WARNING: Couldn't load image: &lt;insert name here&gt;.&#13;
<br/>
Solution- This seems to happen when the material definition's name doesn't match the name of the model's surface.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Problem- Model meshes appear textured in Doom 3, but there are noticeable seams in the normal map.&#13;
<br/>
Solution- The seams appear at places where the UV map isn't continuous. All I've learned to do is hide UV seams whenever possible. It's also a good idea to plan object shapes with UV mapping in mind.&#13;
