<br /><br />Oh yeah,

<br /><br />Hi everyone, I'm new here. After years of mapping for Quake (the original, no bloody 2 or 3 <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224234033im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> ) I decided to bite the bullet and learn some modern tech.  Currently doomedit is kicking my arse but I am getting the hang of it. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101224234033im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p105655" date="Posted: Wed Jul 27, 2005 3:09 pm "><author>kat</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">just1n wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent"><div class="quotetitle">BNA! wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">A mapping contest is prepared, I'm waiting for the official partners to get ready as well.

Just because of the partners?</div>If you think about it, D3 has no longevity becasue it's generally accepted that it doesn't have 'proper' MultiPlayer (in whatever capacity that might be), Q4 does so that's what they're hoping will bring people out into the fray and generate a longer shelf life for their products, not just the game. Makes sense really.
<br /><br />Although that's pretty much a speculative thought [apply appropriate "views of the poster etc....]</div>]]></body></post><post id="p105740" date="Posted: Thu Jul 28, 2005 3:54 am "><author>CrazedFan</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">Looks interesting...

I have only been mapping for Doom 3 for about 2 days now ( years of CS mapping though ) and i'm all for a contest. The worst thing that can happen out of this is a pile of maps getting made that we can all try out <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225004108im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Question about it though. Would we have to make a single player and a MP map? or would we just pick what we wanted? The time needed to make just one map alone is months and I can't see anyone making 2 great maps under a deadline. Myself I would pick single player map because of the detail you can add.

<br /><br />My estimates for time limit / skill levels are as follows.
<br /><br />No. maps released - 0 = low 1-3 = med 4-xx = high
<br /><br />Rating of maps - 0-4 low 5-8 = med 9-10+ = high
<br /><br />Gameplay type - Single Player - Multiplayer
<br /><br />Time limit = 3 Weeks = low, 2 Weeks 3 days = med, 2 Weeks = high

<br />It's not that far away from completion and the Capture The Flag fanatics out there will have another officially supported gametype to make maps for.

<br /><br />I disagree with this method. Number of released maps has nothing to do with the skill of a mapper. 
<br /><br />Infact, I don't even think there should be tiers.

The fact is that there is no way to properly measure the mappers skills and seperate them into groups, and therefore there should be no teirs at all.
<br /><br />If you're a beginner and don't feel confident enough to compete in a contest, then perhaps it might be better to practice and home your skills rather than rush right into a competition with the "big boys"..On the other hand, if you're a beginner and you still want to compete, well knowing that you're going to lose, then all the more power to you!

<br /><br />For a contest like this though there should be a restriction of some kind in the actual size of the map to be produced (Eg a base .map file with a hollowed box so everyone knows what size the map is to be). Then with a reduced map size, set a time limit to 1 month.
<br /><br />The maps to be made would constitute 1/4 of a full map but have all the details in place that would give it the "quality" factor.
<br /><br />The top 5 maps get put into an official map pack, like, the Doom3world map pack.
<br /><br />Dictate rules over if custom models and textures are allowed also. It'd just even the playing field a little more of it was strictly a mapping contest.
<br /><br />I also like the idea that a number of models and a texture set are provided and its down to the mapper to ensure that all the models are included in some way, along with only using the pre-described texture set. These restrictive contests are the best imo because it forces people to think more constructivly about their maps <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225002711im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>]]></body></post><post id="p82552" date="Posted: Wed Mar 16, 2005 2:26 pm "><author>=NoMercy=</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody">I would join, for  Multiplayer map if I can use my MarsLandscape.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p83286" date="Posted: Sun Mar 20, 2005 7:37 am "><author>W01f</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Gazado wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">For a contest like this though there should be a restriction of some kind in the actual size of the map to be produced (Eg a base .map file with a hollowed box so everyone knows what size the map is to be).

<br /><br />Hi everyone, I'm new here. After years of mapping for Quake (the original, no bloody 2 or 3 <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101225005228im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> ) I decided to bite the bullet and learn some modern tech.

Makes sense really.

My estimates for time limit / skill levels are as follows.&#13;
<br/><br/>
No. maps released - 0 = low 1-3 = med 4-xx = high&#13;
<br/><br/>
Rating of maps - 0-4 low 5-8 = med 9-10+ = high&#13;
<br/><br/>
Gameplay type - Single Player - Multiplayer&#13;
<br/><br/>
Time limit = 3 Weeks = low, 2 Weeks 3 days = med, 2 Weeks = high&#13;

I disagree with this method. Number of released maps has nothing to do with the skill of a mapper. &#13;

Infact, I don't even think there should be tiers.

For a contest like this though there should be a restriction of some kind in the actual size of the map to be produced (Eg a base .map file with a hollowed box so everyone knows what size the map is to be). Then with a reduced map size, set a time limit to 1 month.&#13;

The maps to be made would constitute 1/4 of a full map but have all the details in place that would give it the "quality" factor.&#13;

The top 5 maps get put into an official map pack, like, the Doom3world map pack.&#13;
<br/><br/>
Dictate rules over if custom models and textures are allowed also. It'd just even the playing field a little more of it was strictly a mapping contest.&#13;
<br/><br/>
I also like the idea that a number of models and a texture set are provided and its down to the mapper to ensure that all the models are included in some way, along with only using the pre-described texture set. These restrictive contests are the best imo because it forces people to think more constructivly about their maps <img src="/web/20051030084357im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0"/><br/>_________________<br/>Gazz</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

As well as this i would also like to add that we could create a comp for Single player OR! Multiplayer maps as judging them together would be very difficult lol. I would liketo see it put up a.s.a.p. as im well stil pre-alpha on my death match map and kinda losing intrest... again lol, I need a STRICT time limit, kinda like my school homework, which i some how manage to get it in on time  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20051215155309im_/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0"/> . &#13;
<br/><br/>
My estimates for time limit / skill levels are as follows.&#13;
<br/><br/>
No. maps released - 0 = low 1-3 = med 4-xx = high&#13;
<br/><br/>
Rating of maps - 0-4 low 5-8 = med 9-10+ = high&#13;
<br/><br/>
Gameplay type - Single Player - Multiplayer&#13;
<br/><br/>
Time limit = 3 Weeks = low, 2 Weeks 3 days = med, 2 Weeks = high&#13;
<br/><br/>
I;m not saying that is exactly what the should be, if anyone disagrees or ahas better suggestions of how they think the contest should be set up please add comments<br/>_________________<br/>You can take my guns away but i'll still kick your ass!</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

<br/>
It's not that far away from completion and the Capture The Flag fanatics out there will have another officially supported gametype to make maps for.&#13;
<br/><br/>
I would guess that the expansion will increase the popularity for Doom3's multiplayer aswell so you'll probably get a larger user-base for the finished maps. &#13;
<br/><br/>
And certain features like the max-payneish slowmotion powerup and the gravity-gun should inspire some really unique singleplayer maps.</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>

I disagree with this method. Number of released maps has nothing to do with the skill of a mapper. &#13;
<br/><br/>
Infact, I don't even think there should be tiers. Opinions will always differ on those who are right on the fence, and it's bound to cause trouble; for example, what happens if the newbie winner ends up making a map that's better than most of the expert maps? That will cause trouble no matter how <span style="font-style: italic">you</span> would deal with it, because lots of people would still get upset. The fact is that there is no way to properly measure the mappers skills and seperate them into groups, and therefore there should be no teirs at all.&#13;
<br/><br/>
If you're a beginner and don't feel confident enough to compete in a contest, then perhaps it might be better to practice and home your skills rather than rush right into a competition with the "big boys"..On the other hand, if you're a beginner and you still want to compete, well knowing that you're going to lose, then all the more power to you!
