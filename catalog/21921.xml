If you just use them without fully charging and discharging them at least once a month, they start to develop a "memory" and as a result you get less and less use out of a supposedly full charge. This is common with cell phone and laptop batteries.<br /><br />If Sony decided to cut corners in production this could also be the case with your batteries. If they don't yield the same capacity as they should then it's possible that the signal strength is also degraded, hence your connection to the console drops out.<br /><br />I'm a fan of lithium ion batteries. They tend to retain full capacity as long as you use them on a regular basis. I bought some rechargeable batteries for my Wii remotes and I intentionally skipped over all the non-lithium batteries for this exact reason.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p204258" date="Posted: Thu Aug 28, 2008 10:03 am "><author>Burrito</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">Jack Rammsdell wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">I've had the problem before, I used the controller on another ps3, try to reregister your controller to your ps3 system, I am at work at the moment so I can't see what menu it is, but there is a spot in system settings that lets you assign the ps3 controller to your system.
