I'm a coder, so the language of the text makes a lot more sense to me than the step by step instructions often given in tutorials.  I once wrote a reference for menu scripts for JKA, and it was well recieved.  However, I haven't a clue what a <span style="font-style: italic">specularmap</span> or <span style="font-style: italic">diffusemap </span>is, or what <span style="font-style: italic">zeroclamp </span>does, or how the <span style="font-style: italic">maskcolor </span>works in comparison to <span style="font-style: italic">blend add</span>.  That's the kind of tutorial I need to find, in order to help me with Particles and Materials.  Because showing me, as all the tutorials seemed to be focused upon, doesn't help.  &#13;
<br/><br/>
An alphabetical syntax guide of each command is what I'm trying to find, so that when I jump into a material for a quick update, I'm not confused as to why when i remove <span style="font-style: italic">maskcolor</span> the black background around a texture appears in the game, but with it in, the colored portion that is supposed to show dissappears.  *shrug*  also what does <span style="font-style: italic">deform</span> do? and what's the difference between a tube, a sprite and what else....&#13;
<br/><br/>
I think you can see what i mean.  *chuckle*&#13;
<br/><br/>
Thanks&#13;

<br/>
the easiest way to experiment in d3 with textures is this&#13;
<br/><br/>
create a 4 or 5 different textures   ones with alpha stages regular pictures&#13;
<br/>
grey scale pictures (heightmaps)  and a normal map&#13;
<br/><br/>
now create a blank material fie&#13;
<br/><br/>
like this&#13;
<br/>
textures/mine/1&#13;
<br/>
{&#13;
<br/><br/><br/><br/>
}&#13;
<br/><br/>
and save that in the materials folder&#13;
<br/><br/>
now in editor add your blank texture to a wall or brush&#13;
<br/>
hit&#13;
<br/>
f7  --render&#13;
<br/>
f6  --animate&#13;
<br/>
&amp;&#13;
<br/>
f4  -realtime&#13;
<br/><br/>
of course it shows up black&#13;
<br/><br/>
go to the console tab of the entity inspector window&#13;
<br/>
at the bottom field type&#13;
<br/>
editdecls&#13;
<br/>
short for eddit decclarations&#13;
<br/><br/>
this will open an editor&#13;
<br/>
click on materials to expand it then browse to textures and finally browse to your texutre&#13;
<br/>
click edit&#13;
<br/><br/>
everytime you make a change click test it will show the change in your doom3 editor renderview&#13;
<br/><br/>
this way you can check your changes realtime output in editor&#13;
<br/>
I learned alot of tricks that way<br/>_________________<br/>it was bad enough imps and maggots everywhere but when that Hellknight copped a feel that was to much now I really was in hell</span><span class="gensmall"/></td>
