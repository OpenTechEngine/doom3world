You can find them here: NV Control Panel -&gt; Adjust video color settings -&gt; select the monitor you want -&gt; select "with the nvidia settings" -&gt; Advanced -&gt; set "Full (0-255) or Limited (16-235)" to get perfect blacks.</div>]]></body></post><post id="p207153" date="Posted: Wed Nov 05, 2008 1:59 am "><author>Mordenkainen</author><body><![CDATA[<div class="postbody"><div class="quotetitle">goliathvt wrote:</div><div class="quotecontent">Parts came in today.  <br /><br />Holy crap, Crysis w/ the Natural Mod and High/Very High settings is almost like playing an entirely new game.

Dynamic lights always were quite problematic. It ought to be nice to play that game at max details as well.</div>]]></body></post></posts></thread></xml>
